GBI says deputies were attempting to serve a court pickup order when the incident occurred.

Upon arrival on scene, the man resisted the deputies and was armed with a butcher knife.

The man became combative and deputies deployed a Taser on him, which was ineffective.

At some point during the incident, the man lunged towards the deputies with the knife. One of the deputies fired his service weapon, striking the man.

The man was pronounced deceased at the scene.

The man’s body will be transported to the GBI Medical Examiner’s Office in Decatur for autopsy.

On Monday, GBI identified the man as 43-year-old Raymond Whitfield Tarbox II.

No officers were injured during the incident.

The GBI will conduct an independent investigation. Once completed, the case will be turned over to the Lowndes County District Attorney’s Office for review.
