TULSA, Okla.– Last night, an off duty Department of Veteran Affairs Officer was driving with his family to the Garth Brooks concert when events lead to a shooting.

33-year-old officer Andrew Bryiant said he and his family observed a domestic disturbance on the sidewalk as they drove just west of S Denver on E. 11th Street, which was a few blocks away from the Garth Brooks concert.

An independent witness said that a male was abusing a female and had thrown her to the ground.

The officer, witnessing the same altercation, went to intervene. Reports say he got out of his car and was able to verbally stop the assault.

The officer said that he saw a handgun in the waistband of the aggressor as he approached the officer. Once the man grabbed for his gun, that’s when the officer said he drew his own gun and fired shots on the suspect.

Reports say the 23-year-old male, Rodney Walker was transported to St. Francis hospital where he later died.

Tulsa Police Homicide conducted several interviews and the officer has been released.

The Tulsa Police Department says this will be the 5th homicide in Tulsa for 2015.
