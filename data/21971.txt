A 26-year-old man wanted in connection with the shooting death of his estranged wife was killed in a police shooting on Friday, authorities said.

Christopher Michael Diaz was shot by Montebello police around 2:40 p.m. in the 2900 block of West Via Corona following a car chase and foot pursuit, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Police had been searching Diaz, who officials previously described as a “documented gang member,” since Aug. 8, when Montebello police identified him as the main suspect in the death of 28-year-old Roxann Acosta, his estranged wife who was 8 weeks pregnant and had filed for divorce.

Authorities located Diaz on Friday and attempted to perform a traffic stop. Witnesses told KTLA that two police SUVs were in pursuit of another SUV in which Diaz sat in the passenger seat.

He eventually foot bailed and ran into a yard of a home in the 2900 block of West Via Corona.

Diaz then allegedly turned and pointed a semi-automatic handgun at officers and fired at least one round at them after which a police shooting occurred, the Department said in a press release.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, according to sheriff’s officials.

Diaz was married to Acosta about a year before she was found dead of a gunshot wound in Diaz’s mother’s home. She had spent the day with her estranged husband, investigators said.

Acosta left behind a daughter and two sons from a previous relationship, friends said.

A female suspected of being an accomplice to the shooting was previously arrested, but her identity has not been released.

Diaz had an extensive arrest record, including for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer, officials said. It’s not clear if he was convicted.
