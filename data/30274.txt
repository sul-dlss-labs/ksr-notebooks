Collier County Sheriff’s Office and Hendry County Sheriff’s Office responded to a deputy-involved shooting that happened during the chase of a stolen dump truck in Immokalee Wednesday. The driver of the stolen dump truck died after shots were fired by law enforcement, leading to a crash.

According to CCSO, Collier County deputies responded to a call for assistance from HCSO in the pursuit of a driver in a stolen dump truck traveling on State Road 29 into Immokalee.

The truck did not stop, crashing into a vehicle on New Market Road, causing injuries to that driver.

Then, the stolen dump truck continued driving recklessly, crashing into another vehicle and continued to drive away from deputies into Farm Worker Village.

Deputies continued to try stopping the dump truck and protect the residents of the neighborhood, but the driver continued to drive erratically.

Law enforcement shot at the truck. The truck crashed into a canal, and the driver of the stolen dump truck was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver’s cause of death is not confirmed at this time.

Hendry County Sheriff’s Office teamed up with CCSO in the response.

There continued to be traffic patrols in the area of the crash Wednesday night, and deputies were at the scene for the remainder of the day; the truck was not removed until Thursday morning.
