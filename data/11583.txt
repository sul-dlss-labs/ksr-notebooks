VIDEO: Philly Cop Shoots, Kills Armed Man

Philadelphia police have been meeting with Cambodian residents in Olney, after an officer shot an armed man who pointed a gun at him and refused to drop it.

Vanna Sok, 24, was fatally shot earlier this month. Footage obtained by Fox 29 News from the chaotic scene of the shooting was captured by a bystander's cell phone and nearby surveillance camera.

The shooting occurred at about 1 a.m. on July 15. A nearby camera captured a red SUV pulling up to the corner of Second Street and Nedro Avenue. People scatter, after a confrontation and shots are fired. Sok returned fire.

Witnesses told Fox 29 News that a nearby officer off camera fired his weapon at Sok from inside the passenger seat of his police car and shot without any warning.

Cell phone video from after the shooting shows officers pulling Sok's body away into a transport van.
