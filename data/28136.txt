A video recorded by a camera attached to a Jefferson Parish Sheriff deputy’s stun gun captured the moment a man was fatally shot by a fellow deputy following a Marrero chase Wednesday night.

Relatives and the Jefferson Parish Coroner's Office have identified the man as Modesto Reyes, 35. Sheriff Joe Lopinto has said the deputy opened fire because Reyes pointed a gun at the officer.

The eight-second video begins after Reyes trips and falls to the ground during a brief foot chase with two deputies. Sheriff's Office-issued Tasers are equipped with a video camera that starts recording when it is unholstered and activated for use.

The deputy carrying the Taser, a nonlethal weapon that gives an electrical charge, is behind Reyes while the second deputy's foot and leg can be seen in front of and to the right of Reyes as he tries to stand back up.
