Two Phenix City residents are dead, after a weekend wreck in Smiths Station -- which occurred only hours after another deadly crash in Lee County.

Coroner Bill Harris reports Bruce Nevels, 48, and Willow Sellers, 40, died around 2:30 a.m. Saturday on Lee Road 236. Nevels may have been driving too fast, as his car crashed into a concrete utility pole.

That followed a crash at 11:15 p.m. Friday on Lee Road 188 in Loachapoka. Authorities say Billy Joe Yancey of Auburn, 32, tried to escape officers serving arrest warrants. A high-speed chase developed, and Yancey drove off the road and into a tree.

Yancey was thrown out of the car on impact, and died at the scene of the crash. Harris says Yancey may have been drunk, but an autopsy will determine that for sure.
