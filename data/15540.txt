The driver who led police on a chase and caused a fatal crash in Ontario County on Tuesday has been charged with driving while ability impaired by drugs.

Todd Maddox, 47, of Newark, Wayne County, was fleeing police around 3:50 p.m. when he lost control of his 2006 PT Cruiser near routes 88 and 96 in Phelps, striking broadside a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee driven by Jennifer C. Hurlburt, 45, of Phelps, according to the Ontario County Sheriff's Office.

Hurlburt was pronounced dead at the scene. A passenger in the Jeep, Donald Derby Jr., 40, suffered serious injuries and was taken by Life Net helicopter to Strong Memorial Hospital, where he was listed in satisfactory condition on Wednesday.

Maddox also was injured and taken to Strong Memorial Hospital via Mercy Flight. He was listed in guarded condition on Wednesday.

The incident began about 10 minutes before the crash, outside a business in the village of Newark, Wayne County, said Newark Police Chief David Christler. He said police Investigator Jay Warren noticed Maddox involved in an apparent altercation with a woman there and walked over to see what was going on. Christler said Maddox "went into a rage" and began threatening to injure himself and other people with a knife.

Then, Christler said, Maddox got in his car and sped off, nearly striking both the woman and Warren.

The investigator and two marked units from the Newark Police Department followed Maddox as he headed south on Route 88, attempting to make a traffic stop. Ontario County deputies and the State Police were alerted to the situation and the pursuit crossed over into Ontario County.

Christler said Maddox was going about 55 mph when he entered Phelps and caused the crash.

Additional charges against Maddox are pending.
