Officers were investigating a narcotics complaint in the 1500 block of Kingsbridge Drive just before 11 a.m. when 32-year-old Jamarese DeAngelo Coleman fled the home in a red Dodge SUV, police said.

The man sped south on Garland Avenue, west on Buckingham Road and north on Shiloh Road, refusing to stop for officers, said Lt. Pedro Barineau, a police spokesman. He then ran a red light at Shiloh and Belt Line Road and was struck by a black car.

The driver of the other vehicle was taken to a hospital with minor injuries.

One of the Dodge's tires came loose and went through the window of a nearby auto-parts store, striking a customer. That person was hospitalized with injuries that weren't life-threatening.

"As soon as the accident happened, I saw the cop car, then three more," witness Jason Comeau said. "A helicopter was there within a few minutes."

All lanes were closed at the intersection as police investigated the scene.
