Orange Cove – One man is dead after officers opened fire and killed him in Orange Cove on Tuesday afternoon.

Orange Cove police received a call just after 4 p.m. on July 3 from a person living near the intersection of Fourth and H streets. Police say the person called because their family member had been acting weird inside the home. “The individual was acting out in a way that it caused concern for the family,” said Detective Leo Lopez with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Department. He said the man was described as suicidal.

After they arrived on the scene, it is not clear what led the officer-involved shooting to take place. Two officers were involved, but Lopez was able to give few details about the incident.

Family members said that it was the suspect’s mom who actually called police because her son, identified as 48-year-old Alex Ayala, was acting strangely. They say he was schizophrenic and having hallucinations. Family members say he was armed with a knife when he was shot by police. The sheriff’s office has not confirmed whether Ayala was armed.

People who live in the area described hearing police yelling at the man to get down before five to eight shots were fired. Deputies say the man died on the scene.

This marks the first officer-involved shooting for the Orange Cove Police Department, which was re-established in December of 2009. The two officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave.
