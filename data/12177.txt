Dallas Sheriff's Deputies say a 24-year-old Dallas man shot himself after a chase that ended near a DART station Wednesday morning.

According to police, it started in Glenn Heights around 2:50 a.m. after they got a call about a possibly intoxicated driver along Interstate 35 near East Bear Creek Road. The man stopped, but when an officer approached his vehicle, took off, hitting the officer.

After an hour-long pursuit, the chase ended at W. Illinois Avenue and Pierce Street and the man, later identified as 24-year-old Leonel Bustos, exited his vehicle with two handguns. Police tried negotiating with Bustos, who at times, was holding one of the weapons to his head.

Police said Bustos shot himself in a nearby field at about 5:45 a.m. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Dallas County Sheriff's Department released a mugshot of Bustos, above, from Feb. 2011 when he was arrested on a charge of manufacture or delivery of a controlled substance between 1 gram and 4 grams.

That officer was taken to the hospital with a head injury, where he was treated and released. There were no other injuries reported in connection with the chase and shooting.

The nearby Westmoreland DART station was closed for some time while police talked with the man.

The investigation is ongoing.
