BELMONT, the Bronx — Officers fatally shot a knife-wielding man in the Bronx Monday night, police said.

Police responded to Prospect Avenue and East 181st Street in Belmont following reports of an argument, an NYPD spokesman said. The two responding officers repeatedly told a 52-year-old man with a knife to drop the weapon, but he did not comply. He’d been chasing another man in the street.

The knife-wielding man was shot after he lunged at police around 8 p.m., officials said. He was taken to a local hospital but did not survive.

Both officers at the scene were wearing body cameras. One has been with the NYPD for two years. The other officer is a three year veteran on the force.

People should expect a large police presence in the area.

Police recovered a weapon at the scene. No other suspects are wanted.

No additional information was immediately available.
