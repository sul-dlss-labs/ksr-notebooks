Detroit -- An off-duty Wayne County sheriff's deputy who shot and killed an armed intruder will be assigned to administrative duties while an internal investigation proceeds, the Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.

Police said the deputy was inside her southwest Detroit home, on the 1400 block of Beatrice, when she heard the suspect kick in her door and enter at 1:30 a.m. Saturday.

The deputy told police she grabbed her weapon and fired shots at the male intruder, who was armed with a pistol and wearing a black ski mask, striking him in the chest and heart.

"Based on the evidence, it appears the 26-year-old male home invader exchanged shots with the officer. The home invader was struck, received a fatal wound and died at the scene," according to a statement from the Wayne County Sheriff's Office.

The name of the deputy and the intruder have not been released. The Wayne County Sheriff's Office has said the deputy will be assigned to administrative duties pending the outcome of an internal investigation being conducted by the Detroit Police Department.
