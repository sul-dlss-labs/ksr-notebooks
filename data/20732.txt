Appleton - A prosecutor in Outagamie County has determined an Appleton police officer acted legally when he fatally shot a resident.

District Attorney Carrie Schneider said Thursday Sgt. Greg Pieper shot and killed 61-year-old Keith Gabriel after he refused to follow the officer's orders to drop his gun. Schneider says Gabriel had a Colt .45 handgun in his hand and started turning toward Pieper when he was shot three times last Friday. The officer was responding to a report of illegal fireworks when he encountered Gabriel.

WLUK-TV says the Green Bay Police Department investigated the shooting.
