ALGONQUIN â€” A man who fled from Algonquin police at a traffic stop apparently drowned Friday after he jumped into the Fox River, police said.

The body of John T. Kotiw, 19, was pulled from the river about 2:45 a.m., according to authorities, who weren't sure where he lived.

His family, they said, lives in Wisconsin.

About an hour and a half earlier, Kotiw was a passenger in a car whose driver was pulled over on North Hubbard Street for allegedly speeding.

Kotiw fled after police attempted to arrest him for an outstanding warrant, officials said.

He was wanted for failure to appear in McHenry County Circuit Court on a charge of resisting a peace officer, police said.

After Kotiw fled, a resident who lives in the 100 block of North River Road called police to report a man in his back yard near the river.

When police arrived, Kotiw was already in the water. Officers threw him several flotation devices, but he disappeared, police said.

Kotiw's body was found in about 8 to 10 feet of water, not far from where he was seen going under, said Fire Lt. Mike Kern of the Algonquin-Lake in the Hills Fire Protection District.
