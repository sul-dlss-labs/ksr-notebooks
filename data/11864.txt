An Oklahoma man died Sunday when authorities shot him during a confrontation with a Beckham County sheriff's deputy after the man led authorities on an interstate car chase from Oklahoma to the Texas Panhandle, Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper Daniel Hawthorne said.

Eugene Leroy Arnold Jr., 36, of Sayre, Okla., fled a traffic stop early Sunday, heading west on Interstate 40 in Oklahoma's Beckham County, Hawthorne said. Wanted on a violating a protective order charge, Arnold led authorities on a chase into Wheeler County, where local sheriff's deputies and a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper joined the pursuit east of Shamrock, Hawthorne said.

Arnold then turned north onto County Road 26 and crashed through a fence before driving into a field off County Road W, where a Beckham County sheriff's deputy shot him with a Taser, Hawthorne said.

Arnold started fighting with the deputy and tried to take the deputy's gun, Hawthorne said.

Beckham County Sheriff Scott Jay said the deputy shot and killed Arnold. The deputy's name was not released.

Arnold suffered one gunshot wound, Hawthorne said.

The Texas Rangers and Wheeler County Sheriff's Office are investigating, Hawthorne said.
