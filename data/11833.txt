An NYPD sergeant shot dead a 22-year-old ex-con Thursday night during an attempted prostitution arrest in Brooklyn, police sources said.

Tyjuan Hill was one of four men inside a car who cops wanted to question in as part of Operation Losing Proposition, a NYPD initiative that has female undercover officers pose as prostitutes to arrest johns.

Many details about the incident — which occurred in Red Hook, just after 10 p.m. near Hamilton Ave. and W. 9th St., under the elevated Gowanus Expressway — were not yet clear.

But sources said that when police approached the car, all four men got out. Three stayed by the vehicle, but Hill ran off and was chased by an officer and Sgt. Patrick Quigley.

“The cop catches up to him and is wrestling with him, rolling around,” one source said. “The sergeant catches up to them. He sees [Hill] pull out his gun and shoots.”

Hill was struck one time in the head and killed. His gun, a .9mm Kel Tec pistol, was recovered at the scene, police said.

Hill had only been out of jail for about seven months, records show. He was conditionally released from prison in February after he was convicted of attempted robbery and sentenced to two years. A source said he had seven arrests on his record.

Quigley is an eight-year veteran with no disciplinary history, the source said.
