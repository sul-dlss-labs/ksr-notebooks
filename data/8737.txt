MOUNT GREENWOOD â€” An off-duty Chicago police sergeant is not expected to be cited in a crash that killed a 65-year-old woman Saturday, officials said Sunday. An autopsy by the Cook County medical examiner's office found that Carol Jacob, of the 11200 block of South Sawyer Avenue, died of injuries from the collision and ruled her death accidental. The female off-duty officer is not expected to be ticketed because investigators believe Jacob ran a stop sign about 2:15 p.m. at South Kedzie Avenue and 112th Street that caused the crash, police said.
