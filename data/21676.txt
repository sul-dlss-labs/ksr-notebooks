New details emerged Thursday, Aug. 3, in the fatal shooting of an assault suspect by Corona police.

Jashod Arthur Carter, 29, of Perris, died at the end of a pursuit when the car he was riding in crashed in Norco, and he got out and confronted officers while holding a gun.

A Corona Police Department statement released Thursday explained for the first time why officers fired. Carter “exited the car while advancing and firing a handgun at pursuing officers,” the release said.

Four officers fired back at Carter. All have been placed on administrative leave per department policy. Their experience ranges from seven to 14 years of service. The department has not released their names. A court ruling allows agencies to withhold the names of officers involved in shootings if they can document a specific threat against them.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, which is investigating the incident, is making that threat assessment, according to Corona police.

Police also said that the assault occurred at 1650 E. Sixth Street, which is the address for Racks Billiards and Bourbon, the former Angels sports bar. The release did not describe the assault.

Police tried to pull over a car leaving the bar parking lot, but the driver fled in a pursuit that reached 100 mph, the release said. An hour after the shooting, the driver, whose name has not been announced, was arrested. Carter was pronounced dead at the scene.

Corona Police Chief Michael Abel said there is videotape of the shooting.
