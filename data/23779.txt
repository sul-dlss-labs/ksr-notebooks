A man who died two days after being shot in the arm by Mesa police has been identified as 57-year-old Arthur Joseph Gonzales.

Officers initially contacted Gonzales on Thursday while responding to reports of a person with a gun.

Detective Nik Rasheta said police were notified of Gonzales' death late Saturday afternoon, just hours after they'd said he was still in the hospital and expected to survive.

Rasheta said in a statement Monday that the cause of death will be determined by the Maricopa County Office of the Medical Examiner, "which has assumed the death investigation. Any further updates concerning cause of death will be pending the results of their investigation."

Police have not released the identities of the officer or officers who fired their weapons.

Rasheta said officers found Gonzales waving a handgun and rifle as he made "incoherent statements" at a home near Gilbert and Broadway roads, Thursday afternoon.

After a SWAT team arrived to help secure the area, a shooting took place in front of the house, Rasheta said. He said the man ran inside, then was seen in back of the house with a gun, "posing a threat."

A second shooting then took place, Rasheta said.

Police took the man into custody following the second shooting. He was taken to a hospital with a gunshot wound to the arm, Rasheta said.

Police have not said whether the Gonzales fired at officers. Officers discovered about 60 firearms inside the home, Rasheta said.

The shooting remains under investigation.
