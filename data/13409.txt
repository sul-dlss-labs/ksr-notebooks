COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - One suspect is dead following an officer-involved shooting near East Boundary Road and Faraway Drive, according to the Richland County Sheriff's Department.

Department spokesperson Curtis Wilson said deputies were behind a suspicious vehicle at Woodfield Park near Decker Boulevard when a short chase ensued.

Wilson says a short time later, the suspect exited the vehicle and fired multiple shots at the pursuing deputy.

That's when the deputy returned fire and fatally wounded the suspect, according to Wilson.

Authorities have not yet released the identity of the suspect or the deputy.

A post on the sheriff's department's Facebook page shed some light on the incident:

"Sometimes our deputies are forced to make decisions to save their lives or the lives of our citizens. Last night one of [our] Deputies conducted a traffic stop which resulted in the suspect jumping out of his car and firing several times at the Deputy. The Deputy was forced to shoot and kill the suspect. The deputy relied on his training and professionalism during the incident and conducted himself appropriately."



"I will continue to make sure our deputies are given the best training in order to make the best decisions to care for the citizens of Richland County. The Deputy will go through our critical incident support program as he continues his work for the Richland County Sheriff's Department."



SLED is investigating the incident.
