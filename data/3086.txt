DES MOINES, Iowa -- A Des Moines high school student is dead following an accident at the end of a high-speed chase with Des Moines police late Friday night.

Police say the chase ended at Hubbell and University around 11:30 Friday night. The vehicle being chased crashed into a utility pole, snapping the pole in two.

Police say the passenger, 17-year-old Mathew Floyd Perry of Des Moines, died Saturday morning from injuries he sustained. Perry is a student at East High School.

His brother, whom police say also is named Mathew Floyd Perry, received minor injuries. He is held on traffic charges. Police say the teenager who died is named Mathew Floyd Perry III while his brother is named Mathew Floyd Perry IV.

Des Moines police Sgt. Tony Steverson says the younger brother stole the vehicle from a pizza delivery man. The vehicle had been left running outside a house while the pizza was being delivered. Police say they had backed off because the vehicle was being driven so erratically, but were still in pursuit at the time of the accident. The vehicle crossed the centerline, hit another vehicle and then ran into the utility pole.

Counselors will be available at the East High School library at 1 p.m. on Sunday for students who wish to visit with them.
