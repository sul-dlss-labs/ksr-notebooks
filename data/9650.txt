A 22-year-old Bloomington motorcyclist who was killed last night

in a Fontana crash is believed to be the rider who twice evaded

police shortly before the wreck, investigators say.

Gary Grossich died at the scene of the 8:29 p.m. Monday accident

along Jurupa Avenue east of Pacific, according to San Bernardino

County deputy coroners.

Five minutes earlier, an officer had spotted a motorcyclist

driving with his headlight off – a traffic violation – along

Tamarind Avenue near Jurupa Avenue and made a U-turn to chase him,

but the biker sped away, said Sgt. Billy Green.

A few minutes later, a second officer radioed that he was

chasing a motorcyclist west along Jurupa Avenue, Green said. That

officer, too, lost sight of the bike.

Soon afterward, a third officer found the wreckage of a black

1998 Suzuki GSXR and Grossich’s body, Green said.
