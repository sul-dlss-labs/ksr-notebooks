The Bristol County District Attorney’s office has concluded that the level of forced used by the Fall River police in the death of Scott Macomber on May 16, 2016 was not excessive and did not cause his death.

The autopsy report concluded that Mr. Macomber’s death was the result of cardiac dysrhythmia due to hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
