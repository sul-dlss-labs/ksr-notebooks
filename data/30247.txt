INDIANAPOLIS â€” Police say a man has died from injuries suffered when he was shot by officers after pointing a gun at police.

Officers were dispatched around 6:30 p.m. Friday to an apartment complex on Red Mill Drive, which is near East 38th Street and North Franklin Road, on a report of an armed suicidal person, police said.

According to officers, the 48-year-old man, later identified as Monolito Ford, had reportedly fired at least one shot into the air before police arrived.

Three officers responded to the scene. IMPD Assistant Chief Chris Bailey said those officers coordinated their response and prepared to encounter Ford in the apartment complex. One of the officers grabbed a "less-lethal" shotgun, Bailey said, and the officers moved into the complex.

The officers encountered Ford, who was armed and began walking toward the officers. After officers gave him commands to stop, he reportedly pointed his gun at officers, who shot him.

The officers rendered medical aid until paramedics arrived. Medics took Ford to Eskenazi Health, where he died from his injuries.

Police said Ford had reportedly made comments to family members in recent days about having suicidal thoughts.

The investigations, both criminal and administrative, are ongoing, Bailey said. He said all three officers were wearing operational body cameras.
