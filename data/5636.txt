A police pursuit in Brooklyn ended yesterday when an officer, pinned against a parked car by the sport utility vehicle he had pulled over, shot and killed the driver and wounded his passenger.

The officer, whose name was not released, suffered serious leg and back injuries, the police said, and was in stable condition last night at Kings County Hospital Center.

According to the police, the officer and his partner, a sergeant, whose name was also withheld, were on patrol in an unmarked Chevrolet Impala when they saw the S.U.V., a maroon Mitsubishi, run a red light shortly after 1 p.m.

They followed the vehicle west on Kings Highway for about 10 minutes, the police said. One witness, Donne Brown, 38, said that both cars had been speeding and weaving erratically, but the police said that the Impala had followed the Mitsubishi at a regular speed.
