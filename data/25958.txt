WAUSAU PILOT AND REVIEW

TOWN OF CRESCENT, Wis. — Police have identified the man who was found dead Monday in a Rhinelander-area apartment as 26-year-old Anthony R. Sackett.

Oneida County Sheriff’s Capt. Tyler Young said Sackett appears to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police were called at 11:45 a.m. May 1 to an apartment complex on Overland Drive in the town of Crescent for a report of a man who had discharged a firearm multiple times. A woman inside the residence escaped unharmed, Young said.

Members of a special response team made several attempts to make contact with Sackett but were unsuccessful. At 4:10 p.m., the team entered the residence and found the male deceased.

Crescent Elementary School, which is close to the apartment complex, was placed on lockdown temporarily during the incident as a precautionary measure, Young said, adding that no students or staff members were in any danger.

The town of Crescent is just west of Rhinelander.

An autopsy is pending and the incident remains under investigation.
