BRUNSWICK, Ohio (AP) — State officials in northern Ohio on Friday were investigating a police shooting that killed a man who authorities said had stabbed his mother to death.

Officers late Thursday night responded to a report that a man with a history of schizophrenia was threatening his mother with a knife, Brunswick police said in a news release.

After attempting to contact the occupants of the home, police entered and they said William Sears, 30, charged at them. Officers opened fire, fatally wounding Sears.

The investigation revealed that Sears “had attacked and killed his mother with a knife,” police said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Her name has not been released.

No other information was available.

The Ohio Attorney General's Bureau of Criminal Investigation was investigating the incident.
