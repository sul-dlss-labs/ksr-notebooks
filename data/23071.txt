Prosecutors with the District Attorney's office have refused to file any charges against two detectives who were involved in a deadly shooting on February 9th outside a local store.

"It upsets me about Lee being dead I can't replace him," says James Walker.

Walker says his cousin, Lee Caples, died one week ago and he still doesn't understand why.

"Somebody did the wrong thing and who was that I would not say," says Walker."

"The case has been presented to the Shelby County District Attorney's Office and at this time based up on the investigation to date they have declined to file charges against any officer involved," says Lt. Joe Scott with Memphis Police Department.

However, charges were filed against Walter Taylor. Investigators say Taylor gave false information to officers on scene.

"Gave a statement that he witnesses this incident. He gave some information to police which was misleading," says Scott.

Police say they were outside the B-52 Market on N. Hollywood investigating a series of robberies.

They insist Caples approached them and wouldn't leave. They say Caples fired a gun and theys then returned fire-killing him.

Walker says the internal investigation outcome was predictable.

"The boy's are going to be protected. Lee dead. We're going to bury him, everybody's mad and nothing's going to happen," says Walker.

A deadly police shooting with no charges against police, at least for now. The officers are still suspended with pay.

Prosecutors are still awaiting lab results before they close the investigation.
