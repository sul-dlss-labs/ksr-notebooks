A man who was fatally shot by police officers was carrying a replica handgun, according to Bryan Dalton of Beaverton police

BEAVERTON, Ore. – A man who was fatally shot by Beaverton police officers last week was carrying a replica handgun, a spokesman said Wednesday.

At about 5 a.m. on January 16, officers responded to a report of an “unwanted” man at an apartment in the 10100 block of Southwest Murray Boulevard.

Officers interviewed the individuals involved and determined no crime had been committed, Dalton said.

But officers later learned the man involved, 44-year-old Adam Karjalainen, had an arrest warrant and they went back to the apartment, Dalton said.

Officers at the scene said Karjalainen was armed and advanced toward them as they approached the apartment, according to Dalton.

Officer Derek Vuylsteke shot Karjalainen twice after Karjalainen repeatedly refused commands to drop the weapon, Dalton said.

Karjalainen was taken to the hospital, where he later died from his injuries.

Police on Wednesday released a photo and description of the weapon (pictured), a replica similar to a Ruger MKIII.
