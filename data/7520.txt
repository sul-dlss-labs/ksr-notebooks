The Jefferson County District Attorney's Office today cleared two Birmingham police officers in the separate fatal shootings of two men last year.

District Attorney Brandon Falls notified Birmingham police officials that no criminal charges would be brought against officers in the cases of Aubrey Johnson, 19, and Reginald Osby, 59.

Johnson was shot by Birmingham police Sept. 26 at 7921 4th Ave. South by an officer during a confrontation following a hit-and-run accident and a short car chase, police said.Osby, 59, was stabbing his stepson, 27-year-old Deron Cook, with a barbecue fork when a Birmingham police officer shot Osby on Oct.12 at his home at 1917 Avenue J, police said.

The officer was acting in self-defense in the Johnson case, Falls said. Another officer was acting in the defense of someone else when they confronted Osby, he said.

The identities of the officers involved have not been released.

Both shootings were investigated by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation.
