A 48-year-old Lakeside man fatally shot himself late Tuesday after authorities stopped him for driving erratically on the 210 Freeway in Azusa, officials said Thursday.

David Ware Crow was heading eastbound when an off-duty California Highway Patrol officer reported him to Irwindale police, authorities said.

Police stopped Crow east of the Azusa Avenue offramp, and Crow apparently shot himself in the chest as authorities approached, said Craig Harvey, of the Los Angeles County coronerâ€™s office.
