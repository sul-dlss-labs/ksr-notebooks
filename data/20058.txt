DETROIT – The man suspected of shooting a Detroit police officer Sunday night on the city's west side has been identified as James Edward Ray, police announced Monday.

Police said Ray was shot and killed Sunday after allegedly shooting an officer in the head with a .380 nickel plated pistol. The officer was responding to a 911 call about a domestic situation around 11:45 p.m. Sunday in the 10000 block of Joy Road near Wyoming Avenue.

According to Detroit police Chief James Craig, the caller said they would leave the door to the apartment building propped open, but officers instead were locked out of the building. Craig said they repeatedly kicked and pounded on the door to get tenants' attention.

A resident of the building, not involved with the domestic situation, opened the door and began firing. A 14-year veteran of the force was shot in the head with a .380 nickel plated pistol.

EMS was already in route for the domestic situation.

The junior officer at the scene fired several rounds from a covered position and the suspect was shot and killed.

"This is a sobering reminder of the dangers that our officers face every day," Craig said.
