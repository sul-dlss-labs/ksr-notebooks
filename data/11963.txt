The outraged family of a motorcycle passenger who was paralyzed after an October collision with an NYPD squad car is demanding an investigation.

Cops said Ronald Herrera, 20, and his passenger, Leonel Cuevas, 17, attempted to overtake the police cruiser on Walton Ave. in the Bronx on Oct. 27.

The Kawasaki dirt bike, according to cops, slammed into the police car.

Herrera died a week later. Cuevas was paralyzed from the neck down and suffered massive brain damage.

The Daily News reported exclusively this month that a witness says the police account of the deadly wreck is a lie.

"They hit the dirt bike from behind. The bike twisted and Leonel flew off," said the 18-year-old witness, who asked to remain anonymous.

Cuevas' family, who is suing the city for $105 million, called on the Bronx District Attorney's Office to investigate.

"We don't want anybody else to go to the pain and suffering we've gone through," said the injured teen's twin sister, Nathaly Cuevas, at an emotional gathering at Al Sharpton's National Action Network. "We want an investigation."

Sharpton said he supported the family's call for a probe by the Bronx district attorney.

"We are against police brutality," he said.

The NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating. The cops involved haven't been disciplined.
