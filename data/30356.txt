A man died after allegedly shooting his girlfriend and leading police on a chase in Casa Grande on Thursday night, the Casa Grande Police Department said on Friday.

At around 8:25 p.m., police responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex located on the 700 block of Rodeo Road. Upon arrival to the unit, police found a 51-year-old woman suffering from an apparent gunshot wound to the head, Casa Grande police said in a press release.

According to police, the female victim was shot by her boyfriend, 51-year-old Robert Welch. The man fled the area in a car and was not located when officers arrived at the scene, police said.

In order to locate Welch, Casa Grande police shared information regarding the suspect's appearance and his vehicle with local law enforcement agencies.

Later that night, Gila River police officers initiated a pursuit when they located Welch's vehicle, which ended when he crashed in the area of State Route 87 and Hunt Highway, according to police.

Officers then heard a gunshot from the vehicle. When officers approached the car, they found Welch dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.

The cause of the altercation between Welch and the victim is still unknown. The victim was flown to a Phoenix-area hospital where she remained in critical condition Friday afternoon, police said.

The investigation is still ongoing.
