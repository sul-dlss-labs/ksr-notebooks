The woman, identified in an arrest warrant as Roxanne Taylor, 58, of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Atlanta, was spotted in the drive-through at a Wendy's on Piedmont Road by someone who noticed that she matched the description of the bandit who has robbed several metro area drugstores in the past two weeks.

The person notified Atlanta police, who attempted to stop the woman after she left the drive-through, DeKalb police spokeswoman Mekka Parish said. The woman fled, leading police on a chase up Interstate 85 northbound in a gold Jeep Liberty. She was involved in a minor traffic accident after exiting at North Druid Hills Road, Parish said.
