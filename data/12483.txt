(Memphis) Police are investigating a deadly shooting involving their officers.

A south Memphis man was shot and killed by police early Sunday morning in the 400 block of East Georgia.

Police say the man was armed and didn’t follow their orders, but a neighbor paints a different picture of what led up to the shooting.

Sunday, Oscar Ellis hammered a stake into the ground.

He built a memorial for his long time neighbor, 63-year-old Horace Whiting.

Whiting was shot and killed by Memphis Police and Ellis watched it all from his bedroom window, “I heard a lot of loud speakers saying ‘put down the gun put down the gun.”

According to police, they were originally called out to Mississippi and Danny Thomas for reports of a man standing in the middle of the street with a gun.

They found Whiting blocks away on Georgia in front of his home with a shotgun.

Investigators tell News Channel 3, they tried to get Whiting to put down his shotgun but he fired, so they fired back, hitting the grandfather.

“They shot him, two or three shots,” said Ellis.

According to Ellis, he saw his neighbor with the shotgun but says Whiting never raised it, “It wasn’t up in no threat or something. I just wish he would have put it down.”

But the neighbor also wishes police would have acted differently, “I just wish they would have brought in a negotiator, shot him in the legs or something, don’t kill him.”

The names of the officers involved have not been released.
