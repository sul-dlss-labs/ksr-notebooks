On 09/29/2015, Rockport Police Department officers responded to a call for service in the 100 block of Rattlesnake Point Road in reference to a male fighting with a female.

The female had requested Emergency Medical Services (E.M.S.) and the male was refusing to let her get in the ambulance. Rockport Police Officer David Rollins arrive on scene and then requested that an Aransas County Sheriff's Deputy make location.

Deputy Eric Cargal arrived on location and observed a male dragging an unconscious female. Officer Rollins was telling the male, later ID'd as Wesley W. Manning, to let the female go.

Wesley refused to let go of the female, later ID'd as Sherry Vess. Officer Rollins and Deputy Cargal engaged Wesley and attempted to place him in hand restraints. They were unable to place Wesley in hand restraints. Deputy Cargal deployed his Taser and the Taser was ineffective on gaining compliance from Wesley. Other Aransas County deputies and Rockport Police officer arrived on scene and were unsuccessful in gaining compliance from Wesley.

Wesley began walking and running westbound on Rattlesnake Point Road with deputies and officers struggling along the way to get him in hand restraints. Wesley collapsed on the roadway on Rattlesnake Point Road and stopped breathing. Deputies and officers on scene then began CPR until EMS arrived and took over CPR.

Wesley was transported to Care Regional Medical Hospital in Aransas Pass Texas where he was pronounced deceased at 7:19 p.m. (09/29/2015) E.O.S
