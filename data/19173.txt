Eyewitnesses led police to the suspect in the homicide, who confronted officers with a shotgun.

That man was then shot by a Newton Police officer. That man was taken to the hospital where he later died.

Harvey County Sheriff Chad Gay did not identify the suspect, but said he was a male that was known to law enforcement.

Three other people were at the home at the time of the shooting. Police are talking with those people this morning as they piece together what happened.

Police are looking for another person who was at the scene at the time, but police do not believe that person is a danger to the public.

No officers were hurt in the case.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation was called in to assist in the investigation.
