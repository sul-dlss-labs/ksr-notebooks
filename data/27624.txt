A man who was fatally shot by an FBI agent this week in Belton was the subject of a months-long domestic terrorism investigation led by federal authorities, the FBI said in a statement Wednesday.

The shooting took place as the FBI attempted to arrest Timothy Wilson on suspicion of planning to bomb a hospital, the agency stated.

According the FBI, authorities planned to arrest Wilson in Belton, where he was supposed to pick up what he thought was a “vehicle-born improvised explosive device.” There was no actual bomb at the scene, the FBI said.

During the attempted arrest, an agent shot Wilson, 36, who was allegedly armed, in the 100 block of Wilbur Parrish Circle. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No other details have been released.

In an earlier statement, the FBI said it was continuing to investigate the agent-involved shooting.

It is the second time recently an FBI agent has been involved in a fatal shooting. In February, David William Irving, 35, was shot and killed by an agent at the Alcazar apartment building at 3906 Baltimore.

Irving was fatally shot as a task force served an arrest warrant, according to FBI officials in Kansas City.

The FBI did not describe the details of the arrest warrant or how the shooting occurred. It did not say whether Irving died at the scene.

The FBI’s inspection division, based in Washington D.C., is investigating that shooting, according to an agency spokesman.
