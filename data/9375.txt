Chicago, IL-(ENEWSPF)- Around 9:00 a.m. on Wednesday, August 10, police say an individual walked into the Bank of America branch located at 2545 Devon, Lincolnwood, Illinois; approached the teller; and allegedly announced a bank robbery. He allegedly told the teller he had a gun and a bomb, according to police. After receiving an undisclosed amount of money, the robber then fled the bank, and was seen getting into a taxi cab that was waiting outside the bank for him. Chicago Police Department Patrolman followed the cab westbound, and pulled it over at Western north of Catalpa. As the officer approached the cab, the alleged robber is believed to have committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

A suitcase found in the cab was suspected of containing a bomb. Out of an abundance of caution, the bomb squad was called out and blew up the briefcase. No bomb was found inside the briefcase.

The identity of the robber is unknown at this time. Details are still coming in. Investigation is continuing.
