NEW YORK — A Queens correction officer will not be charged with shooting his romantic rival to death because he was acting in self-defense, officials said Saturday.

Oniel Linton, 36, admitted to cops he shot retired correction officer Jeffrey Ragland in Queens Village early Friday, but said he only fired after Ragland pulled a gun on him.
