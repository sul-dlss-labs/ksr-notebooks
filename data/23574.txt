An Omahan was killed and another seriously injured when the stolen SUV they were in crashed during a central Nebraska pursuit late Friday night.

Authorities say Autumn Standley, 25, died at the scene and Luis Elias, 26, was taken by ambulance to a local hospital and then airlifted by medical helicopter for treatment in Lincoln.

Shortly before 10 p.m. a Merrick County Sheriff's deputy began pursuit of a Dodge Durango when it failed to stop after a traffic violation in Central City. The vehicle crashed and rolled a short time later just west of Osceola, in Polk County. Both Standley and Elias were thrown from the SUV.

The Durango had been stolen in Iowa.

The Nebraska State Patrol is handling the investigation and still trying to determine who was driving the Durango.

A grand jury will also review the case as is required by state law when someone dies while in custody or in the course of apprehension.
