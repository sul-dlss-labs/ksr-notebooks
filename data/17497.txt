ODESSA, TX (KWES) - Law enforcement swarmed 2001 E. Hwy. 80 in Odessa right before 9 p.m. Friday.

Two police officers tried to serve a warrant for Jody Threadgill but first made contact with another man inside the room Threadgill was in.

"They attempted to make contact, they made contact with a subject who began fighting with two of our patrol officers. They began fighting back, they got in a fist fight. At some point the subject grabbed the gun, pointed the gun at the officers, the officers returned fire, shot and killed him," said Cpl. Steve LeSueur

The man who was shot and killed is identified as Joel Fabela, 37. The relationship between Fabela and Threadgill is unknown.

Threadgill fled the scene after Fabela was shot and killed.

Threadgill was arrested back in January at a nearby motel on highway 80 for drug possession.

Law enforcement reacted quickly to the shooting and no officers were hurt.

Odessa Police say situations likes these are not strange to them.

"This is our fourth officer involved shooting within the last, 16 months," said LeSueur.

Crime tape blocked the entire property and the hotel was placed on lockdown.

DPS Troopers, Odessa Police and Texas Rangers all responded and stayed on the scene until a warrant was obtained for the room Threadgill was in.

Since the shooting was officer involved the Texas Rangers are now leading the investigation with the help of Odessa Police.
