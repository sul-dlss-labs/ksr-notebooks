A Mesa police officer shot and killed a man at a La Quinta Inn on Sunday night after receiving reports that he was pointing a rifle out of the hotel window, officials said.

Two guests in the pool area reported seeing the man point a rifle outside the fifth-floor window of his hotel room, located near U.S. 60 and Power Road, said Detective Steve Berry, a Mesa police spokesman.

Police located the hotel room and commanded the two occupants, a man and a woman, to come out, Berry said. The pair exited the room, and police detained the woman without struggle.

Berry said the man refused to comply with officer commands and reached toward his lower back several times.

"Based on the initial report of the suspect having a gun, not complying with commands and reaching behind his body, the officer felt threatened and discharged his weapon, striking the suspect," Berry said in a prepared statement.

Mesa Fire and Medical crews pronounced him dead at the scene. A gun was found, but Berry said he didn't know whether the gun was in the hotel room or in the man's possession at the time of the shooting.

Police are withholding the man's name pending next-of-kin notification. Berry said the officer was placed on standard administrative leave. The woman is not facing any criminal charges, he said.
