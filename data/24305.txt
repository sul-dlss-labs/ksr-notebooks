MONROE, Ga. â€” Authorities in Georgia say a sheriff's deputy shot and killed a man who shot his relative in front of deputies.

News outlets cite a Georgia Bureau of Investigation release that says Walton County deputies responded to a report of a man with a gun "exhibiting erratic behavior" on Tuesday morning. Deputies and a family member entered the home, attempting to calm 26-year-old Chavius Hollis down.

The GBI says Hollis then raised his gun and shot the family member, at which point one deputy fired shots, killing Hollis.

The relative suffered a gunshot wound to his leg and is expected to recover.

No deputies were injured. The GBI is investigating and Hollis will undergo an autopsy.
