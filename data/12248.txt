TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - Police received a call around 7:30 p.m. yesterday from a suicidal man. The man wanted to meet with officers in an open area at the apartment complex. This happened on the east side of Tucson at the Edgewood apartment complex.

Police say 30-year-old Dustin Wernli called 911 saying he was a combat veteran with post-traumatic stress disorder who was feeling suicidal.

Police arrived and found Wernli armed but wanting to talk to officers. They say he spoke with them for about 15 minutes. But, then he reached for a holstered handgun after repeated warnings from officers to keep his hands away from weapons.

Police say they feared for their safety and the safety of others in the apartment complex, so an officer fired. Wernli died at the hospital.

Many neighbors around the area heard the gunshot and were shocked to hear what happened.

"It is crazy you think that on this side of town that this wouldn't happen it's a real quiet side of town over the two years I have lived here nothing like this has happened so it's pretty scary," said TJ Hernandez, a resident of the Edgewood Apartments.
