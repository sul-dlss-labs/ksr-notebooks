A man died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after barricading himself in a Paramount home late Friday.

About 9:30 p.m. Friday Los Angeles County Sheriff’s deputies responded to the 6600 block of San Carlos Street after a man reported being shot by another man.

The victim, believed to be a resident of the home, was shot in in the arm. He told KTLA that he heard at least two gunshots before realizing he had been grazed by a bullet.

He eventually discovered the man in the crawl space of his home.

The man then barricaded himself in the home and SWAT officials and a sheriff’s helicopter responded to the area about 12:20 a.m. Saturday.

Special enforcement bureau officials asked residents to avoid the area.

No shots were fired by authorities, officials told KTLA.

A robot was sent into the home to find the man after officials were not able to make contact, and about 5:20 a.m. the man was found dead in the crawl space and a weapon was discovered. The area was deemed safe, special enforcement bureau officials tweeted.

Homicide detectives then took over the investigation, but officials said the man appeared to have died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He has not been identified.

Residents who were asked to leave the area were allowed to return to their homes about 6 a.m.
