GOOSE CREEK, SC (WCSC) - The Berkeley County Coroner's Office says a speeding suspect in last month's accident has died from his injuries he received on February 23.

The coroner's office say 24-year-old Dennis Lee Smalls of Goose Creek died around 2:40 p.m. Sunday.

Authorities released video of an accident that injured more than six people at the intersection of Red Bank Road and N. Rhett Avenue on that Saturday night.

Hanahan police say a car was traveling in the area when an officer clocked a 2006 Nissan Altima going 105-mph in a 55-mph speed zone. Police say the officer attempted to catch up with the speeding car.

An incident report states when the officer attempted to pull over the car, the suspect, Smalls, accelerated his vehicle to over 100 mph. Police say as the suspect's car approached the intersection of Henry Brown Boulevard and Redbank Road, he ran through a red light and struck a Honda Odyssey taxi cab van.

Video released shows the suspect's car in the distance crashing into the taxi van. People in the area are then seen attempting to help the people in the van.

The suspect's car caught on fire, "vaulted" through the air and came to rest in front of a Burger King.

Emergency crews say a passenger in the van was ejected out of the rear windshield. Authorities report that another passenger and the driver of the van also had injuries.

According to police, the suspect was found in his car along with a woman. Both were suffering from injuries. Officers report that Smalls appeared "grossly" intoxicated and was vomiting on himself as he fell out of the vehicle.

Smalls and his 18-year-old passenger who was not wearing a seatbelt were also hurt in the crash and were taken to MUSC.
