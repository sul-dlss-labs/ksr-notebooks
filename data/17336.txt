An altercation took place and police tried to use a stun gun to stop him from fighting, which had little to no effect.While officers attempted to gain control, Zoucha became unresponsive.Police began administering CPR while fire and medic personnel responded to the scene.Zoucha was taken to Nebraska Medicine in Bellevue; however, rescue efforts were unsuccessful and he was pronounced dead at the hospital.During the investigation, officers learned that prior to making contact with him, Zoucha had reportedly physically assaulted his grandmother at a home near the original scene.Zoucha's grandmother suffered minor injuries; she was treated at Nebraska Medicine and later released.The Bellevue police officers who responded to this incident were Officer Allison Evans, 28; Officer Holly McQuaid, 33; Officer Ashley Meyers, 32; and Officer Anthony Orsi, 30.There were no injuries to the officers involved.An autopsy on Zoucha has been ordered.
