<div class="ExternalClassB6C0BD8DB78D43D2A05012BB535F0410"><html> The Phoenix Police Department released a new Critical Incident Briefing video from an officer involved shooting. The shooting happened early Sunday morning, November 3, 2019 at a home near 28th Street and Atlanta Avenue.<br><br> Officers were first called to the home the night before shortly before 8 p.m. The caller said that 32-year-old Michael Austin had hit his mother and was armed with what the caller described as a “big" gun. <br><br> The officers arrived, knocking at the front door. The people inside refused to open the door and told officers that everything was fine. The officers did not have any additional information to indicate that the residents needed additional help and so they left.<br><br> A second call came into 911 three hours later, at 11:30 p.m. The caller said that his brother-in-law was armed with a gun and had punched a 69-year-old woman who needed medical attention. <br><br> Officers arrived at the home and tried to contact the people inside. While out front the officers heard a shot inside the house. <br><br> The officers determined that the people inside were in immediate danger and approached the east side of the house. The officers broke a window to gain a better view of where the shot had come from. After breaking the window, they were met by gunfire. <br><br> At that point, officers reassessed their approach. They began to give Austin commands via a police vehicle public address system. Austin was asked repeatedly to exit the home with his hands up, but he refused. <br><br> At this point, with a suspect firing shot inside the home and refusing to leave, and the possibility of injured victims, the Special Assignment Unit or SAU, was called to take over. <br><br> SAU officers gathered cell phone numbers for Austin and tried to call him, but he did not answer. With the help of witnesses,' officers were able to confirm there were three other people inside the house, including Austin's brother, sister and Mom. <br><br> At the time of this incident, SAU officers were not equipped with body worn cameras so there is no video of the 5-hour standoff, but here is a timeline of events: <br><br> 12:15 a.m. Officers coordinate tactical approach to the residence. Officers hear shots being fired inside.<br><br> 12:21 a.m. Shots are fired in the direction of the officers. Officers move to cover.<br><br> 12:24 a.m. Shots are fired through the walls by the suspect.<br><br> 12:26 a.m. Officers re-group at the front of the residence.<br><br> 12:29 a.m. Shots are fired through the walls by the suspect.<br><br> 12:40 a.m. Negotiations begin.<br><br> 1:15 a.m. Special Assignment Officers arrive.<br><br> 1:37 a.m. One shot heard at the front of the residence.<br><br> 1:30 a.m. – 4:30 a.m.: SAU officers continued communication efforts with Austin. Officers utilize electronic equipment to gain a better view of the residence, but unfortunately, are unsuccessful. <br><br> 4:39 a.m. Shots heard, suspect seen armed. Despite repeated requests to verify that the others in the house are fine, the suspect refused to allow them to speak or leave the home. A tactical plan is made to rescue the victims.<br><br> 5:02 a.m. An SAU officer sees the armed suspect and fires at the suspect as the rescue team approaches the front door.<br><br> 5:03-5:05 a.m. Suspect walks down the hallway toward the front and shoots at officers. Two officers shot at Austin, striking him. During the gunfire a fragment from projectiles fired by the officers struck the two female victims who were later discovered huddled in an oversized chair where Austin had been standing.<br><br> An officer was also struck by a fragment as he was standing outside the living room window. <br><br> Additionally, an SAU officer was bitten by one of our police canines prior to entering the house. <br><br> Both women, both officers and the suspect were removed from the home for medical attention. The suspect was pronounced deceased at the scene by fire personnel. <br><br> Inside the home investigators determined Austin fired more than 25 rounds and was armed with two firearms.
