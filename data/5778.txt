A 59-year-old Long Island electrician who was months away from retirement was killed yesterday afternoon in his living room when a car being pursued by the police crashed into his brick home in Farmingdale and rolled over him, the authorities and a friend of the victim said.

The Suffolk County police said the accident ended a four-minute, high-speed car chase that began when officers broke up a suspected drug deal in the town of Amityville, about five miles away.

Investigators said that the driver, Richard Maier, 28, was likely under the influence when he lost control of his gray 2006 Pontiac during an evasive U-turn. He then smashed through several walls of a ranch house at 952 Fulton Avenue and hit the victim, William S. Calhoun, they said.

After the crash, Mr. Maier got out of the vehicle and tried to run through the front door of the house, but instead he was caught and arrested, said John Calogianes, a gas station employee who said he saw part of the chase. “He was getting very violent; it took five or six cops to hold him down.”
