? A suspect in a Kansas City carjacking who allegedly aimed a pistol at police was shot to death by officers Monday afternoon.

Police said Timothy Broaddus, 38, of Kansas City, was a suspect in a carjacking that occurred about 10 minutes before the shooting.

Police said a woman reported Monday that she was cleaning out the back seat of her car when a man got into the front seat, brandishing a gun and threatening her.

The woman let him have the car.

About 10 minutes later, police spotted the car, which had been abandoned on railroad tracks.

Police said they then saw a man matching the description of the carjacker walking about a block away.

When police confronted him, Broaddus pulled a revolver from his waistband, pointed it at the officers and cocked it, police said. Thatâ€™s when officers shot him.

Police Capt. Rich Lockhart said it was unclear how many shots were fired or whether any shots were fired by the suspect.

As is routine, the officers involved in the incident were placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.
