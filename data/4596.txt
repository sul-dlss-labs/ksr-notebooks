CHICAGO â€” Chicago police fatally shot a man who allegedly refused to drop his gun Monday night during a drug bust on the South Side.

The shooting occurred during a stakeout at 49th Street and Drexel Boulevard, where police were told a suspected drug dealer in a red Thunderbird would show up for a drug sale, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

Plainclothes officers in unmarked cars were waiting in the area at about 11:45 p.m. when a man in a red Thunderbird pulled up, Camden said. Several unmarked police cars closed in. The suspect backed up the car, hitting a police car, jumped out of the vehicle with a gun in his hand and headed east on 49th Street, police said.

He encountered an undercover officer, Camden said. The officer said he was with the police and, along with several other officers, yelled at him to drop the gun, Camden said. He did not drop the gun, and the officer fired two shots at the suspect, striking him in the chest, Camden said.

The Cook County medical examiner's office identified the man as Walter Armstrong, 26, of the 600 block of East Pershing Road. A police roundtable discussion found that the officer acted in accordance with department policy governing the use of deadly force, according to a WGN-TV report Tuesday night.
