A Clark County sheriff’s deputy who shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at the deputy’s face in December was cleared of any wrongdoing.

Deputy Steve Fox acted reasonably and lawfully when he shot and killed Paul J. Kolar, Clark County Prosecutor Tony Golik wrote in a review of the officer-involved shooting.

The incident began when Fox was sent to 319 N.W. 289th St., at 7:50 a.m. Dec. 18 for a report of a prowler.

A woman called 911 after a suspicious person banged on her door and stated he was stuck and needed help, the review states.

Fox arrived and approached the person, identified as Kolar, and a Jeep Compass that appeared stuck in a field.
