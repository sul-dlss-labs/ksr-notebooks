Investigators from the Hudson County prosecutor’s office are probing a police shooting in Jersey City that left a man dead. Assistant Prosecutor Gene Rubino says Lavon King, 20, had five open cases in Superior Court for drugs and theft, as well as a pending violation of probation.

King was first observed on Kearney Avenue at around 4:30 p.m. One officer pursued him on foot and another in a police vehicle. King allegedly fled through several backyards on Ege Avenue and entered an unlocked shed. Police say King struggled with one of the officers, trying to disarm him.

King had been arrested several times before, and his run-ins with the law date back to July 2010, when he was sentenced to 15 months in the Jamesburg Juvenile Detention Center for theft and dealing drugs near a school, officials said.

Jersey City NAACP President William Braker and supporters visited City Hall last week to tell the City Council that Ward F needs more police foot patrols in the wake of King’s death and other recent shootings.

On June 22, three women were shot after two gunmen fired into a crowd outside a housing complex near downtown Jersey City. The three women are Jersey City residents ages 40, 32 and 29 and were treated for non-life-threatening injuries at Jersey City Medical Center.

The King shooting was the second incident in New Jersey last week involving the police. A man in his mid-40s was killed Sunday when Elizabeth police responded to a domestic incident at the 300 block of Union Avenue.
