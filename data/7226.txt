LAURIE, Mo. â€” A Camden County man lays dead of what police are calling self-inflicted gunshot wounds. The Morgan County SWAT Team stormed the white pickup truck the man was in, but proved too late to save his life. David Lee Stout died Friday afternoon, June 13, in the Save-a-Lot parking lot off Main Street.

Law enforcement was called to a white GMC pickup in the northeast corner of the parking lot. The 911-call indicated Stout was armed and possibly threatening to harm himself.

The Laurie and Sunrise Beach police, Water Patrol, Camden County Sheriff's Department and Morgan County SWAT team all responded immediately. After a short period of planning the SWAT Team got into a single-file line to extract Stout from the truck. As they moved forward a witness said they threw a flash grenade, broke the driver-side window with the butt of a rifle and relaxed their weapons after the sight of Stout's condition.

Stout had apparently shot himself in the chest and head, according to law enforcement. Witnesses said they heard only the explosion of the grenade, but the Stout is reported to have two gunshot wounds from a .22-calibur handgun.

The Morgan County Sheriff classified the gunshot wounds as self-inflicted.

The Morgan County Coroner has ordered an autopsy.
