The sheriff's office said the guards were hired by two alleged drug dealers to collect a $70,000 debt.

Jeffrey Smith, 22, of the 1400 block of North Lotus Avenue was shot in front of his home about 10 p.m. May 3, according to investigators with the Sheriff's Police Gang Unit and the Chicago Police Department.

Smith died of a gunshot wound to the shoulder three days later in Cook County Hospital, the medical examiner's office said.

Charged with first-degree murder were guards John LaVelle, 32, of Orland Hills and Esteban Perkins, 31, of Chicago.

Investigators said LaVelle, Perkins and one of the alleged drug dealers went to Smith's home May 3 to collect a debt from Smith's father. Smith allegedly opened fire on the three men but failed to hit them, authorities said.

Police said LaVelle fired back, hitting Smith.

Also charged with murder were Carlos Santos, 24, of the 3800 block of West Diversey Avenue in Chicago and Alexander Valencia, 30, of the 9600 block of South Kedvale Avenue in Oak Lawn, authorities said.

A third guard, Morris Richardson, 29, of Chicago was not at the scene of the shooting but was charged with official misconduct for allegedly twice visiting the home earlier, said sheriff's spokesman Bill Cunningham.

An undercover sheriff's police officer met Thursday with LaVelle and paid LaVelle $8,000 to be distributed among the three jail guards for their part in collecting the debt, authorities said. LaVelle, Richardson and Perkins were arrested Thursday.

All three guards are scheduled to appear Saturday in Bond Court.
