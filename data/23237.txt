Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack today announced that USDA's SuperTracker diet planning and tracking tool has reached one million registered users. SuperTracker is a resource to help individuals make healthy lifestyle choices to improve their dietary pattern, maintain a healthy weight, track their level of physical activity, and reduce their risk of chronic disease.

"SuperTracker allows Americans to build a healthier diet based on individual needs and personal preferences," said Vilsack. "Overcoming the health and nutrition challenges we face as a nation is critical. I am thrilled that so many people, particularly young people, are taking advantage of this resource to improve their overall health and well-being."

Built and maintained by USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion (CNPP), SuperTracker is free to use and available at ChooseMyPlate.gov. CNPP continues to update SuperTracker's features based on user feedback, including:

Updated food and physical activity databases that allow users to track foods and activities as accurately as possible;

An enhancement to allow users to set a personal calorie goal using the My Top 5 Goals feature; and

Additional capabilities planned for release in 2013.

The SuperTracker's million-user milestone comes as USDA highlights the fourth in a series of quarterly consumer messages supporting the MyPlate icon – Make at Least Half Your Grains Whole Grains – that USDA is promoting in conjunction with more than 6,000 organizations participating in the MyPlate Nutrition Communicators Network. Consumers can use SuperTracker to monitor their whole grain intake and receive tips and support to optimize their choices.

SuperTracker was unveiled in December 2011 as a complement to the new MyPlate icon and First Lady Michelle Obama's Let's Move initiative. SuperTracker incorporates both the 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and the 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines and helps Americans put them into practice in their day to day activities.

As Americans experience epidemic rates of overweight and obesity, the online resources and tools available at ChooseMyPlate.gov, including SuperTracker, can empower people to make healthier food and physical activity choices for themselves, their families, and their children.
