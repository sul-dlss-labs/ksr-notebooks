COLFAX — A Davenport man killed early Sunday morning at the 155 mile marker on Interstate 80 was initially pursed by the Polk County Sheriff’s deputies before entering Jasper County, Lt. Jana Abens of the Polk County Sheriff’s Office said Tuesday morning.

Officials report a car was spotted at 2:39 a.m. driving at a high rate of speed on I-80 eastbound by another motorist near Altoona. The driver was later identified as 26-year-old Scott A. Trimble.

Polk County deputies were not able to slow Trimble, and the pursuit was continued by Mitchellville police who reportedly posted stopping sticks causing Trimble to briefly loose control of his four-door Lincoln before entering Jasper County where Iowa State Patrol took over the chase.

Trimble continued to evade officers eastbound on I-80 until losing control of his vehicle near Colfax at 2:48 a.m. The report states the subject’s car “vaulted” across the median, impacting a semi-truck in the westbound lane.

Trimble was pronounced dead at the scene by the state medical examiner. Trimble’s passenger was injured and transported to Skiff Medical Center in Newton by ambulance.

The driver of the semi was unharmed.

ISP Sgt. Scott Bright said Monday an investigation has been launched in the incident.
