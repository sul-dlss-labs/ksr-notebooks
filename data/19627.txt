MANISTEE, MI -- The man who was shot multiple times Tuesday evening by a Manistee Department of Public Safety officer has died.

Lee Pat Milks, 73, died overnight as a result of his injuries sustained in the officer-involved shooting, according to police.

The officer who shot Milks said the man started to point a rifle at him. He has been placed on administrative leave with pay while Michigan State Police investigates the incident.

Police said the shooting occurred just before 5:30 p.m. Tuesday, March 28 as the officer was doing ordinance enforcement in the 400 block of Second Street in Manistee.

Milks allegedly came out of his house with a long gun and told the officer to go away. The officer called for backup and gave orders to the man to drop the weapon, according to Director of Public Safety David Bachman.

The suspect "stopped, chambered a round and was bringing the weapon to bear on the officer" when he was shot multiple times, police said.

Police do not believe the man fired his rifle before falling to the ground. He was taken to West Shore Medical Center in Manistee, and later transferred by helicopter to a trauma center.

Mansitee Police are not releasing the officer's name at this time.
