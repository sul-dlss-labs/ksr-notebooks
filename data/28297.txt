Wasilla, Alaska (KINY) - Matthew Fox, 40, was shot after he allegedly grabbed for a firearm as police tried to serve an arrest warrant on him Tuesday.

A U.S Marshals Fugitive Task Force and the Alaska State Troopers Drug Enforcement Unit made contact with Fox and attempted to serve the arrest warrant.

Troopers said Fox attempted to elude officers in a vehicle but officers utilized a block and pin vehicle immobilizing tactic to render the vehicle stuck in a ditch.

Troopers added that Fox refused to comply with officers and actively resisted arrest.

They went on to report that Fox made threatening statements and reached for a firearm.

It appeared from the report released by troopers that more than one officer fired at the suspect.

The Alaska Bureau of Investigation will investigate the shooting.
