OKALOOSA ISLAND — A man who was seriously injured after leading police on a chase down U.S. Highway 98 before jumping out of his moving vehicle and running has died.

Christian D. Norman, 28, of Birmingham, Alabama succumbed to injuries he sustained in the Aug. 14 incident, according to the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office.

A deputy spotted a traffic crash on U.S. Highway 98 in front of Harbor Plaza in Destin at around 10:30 p.m. that Tuesday night, according to the OCSO. A 32-year-old Jeep driver reported he’d been hit by a pickup truck that then continued driving westbound on U.S. 98 toward Okaloosa Island

The Jeep driver wasn’t hurt, but his car had disabling damage and appeared to have been sideswiped.

A K9 deputy later spotted a truck matching the description of the hit-and-run truck driving westbound on Okaloosa Island on its rims with “sparks coming out,” according to the Sheriff’s Office. The driver, later identified as Norman, didn’t yield for several miles.

But the driver then jumped out of the truck while it was still moving, and the truck continued down U.S. 98 until it crashed into a bush.

Norman was taken to Fort Walton Beach Medical Center with severe head trauma, where he later died.

The Florida Highway Patrol assisted the Sheriff’s Office with the crash.
