Two Anaheim officers shot and killed a suspect fleeing the scene of an undercover narcotics investigation after the man was hit by a car, police said Monday. The name of the suspect, who investigators said had been involved in a drug transaction with undercover officers, was not released.

“At this early stage, we don’t know what happened that made the officers fire their weapons,” said Sgt. Rick Martinez, a spokesman for the Anaheim Police Department.

The shooting occurred about 1 p.m. near North Acacia Street and La Palma Avenue, where the transaction had taken place, he said. When the undercover officers identified themselves, Martinez said, the suspect ran across Acacia and was hit by a compact car and knocked down.

“At that point, the officers were giving him commands, like ‘Keep your hands in view’ and such,” Martinez said. “The next thing we know, two officers fired their service weapons.”

Martinez did not know whether the suspect was armed.

The wounded man was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he died a short time later.

A second suspect, who fled in a different direction, was later captured, Martinez said.

Anaheim police and the Orange County district attorney’s office are investigating the shooting. The D.A.’s office investigates all police shootings in the county.
