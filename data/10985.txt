Christian Cobian, a 26-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by sheriff's deputies Saturday, Jan. 21, in the 44200 block of 10th Street West in Lancaster, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Two deputies on patrol attempted to stop Cobian shortly before 11 p.m. near the intersection of 10th Street and Avenue J-4. Officials said Cobian was riding a bicycle without a headlight in a dimly lighted area.

As deputies approached, Cobian dropped his bicycle and ran into the rear of a nearby business. The deputies chased him. The deputies alleged that he reached toward his waistband. Fearing for their safety, they said, they opened fire.

Cobian was pronounced dead at the scene. The deputies were not injured.

Investigators have been unable to find a weapon in the area near where deputies shot Cobian, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said.

Officials said Cobian had been a gang member in Inglewood, was wanted on a felony narcotics warrant and was on probation for receiving stolen property. The department also said he had three previous felony convictions.

The shooting remains under investigation.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the sheriffâ€™s homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
