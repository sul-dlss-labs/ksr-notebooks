MARSTON, MO (KFVS) - According to New Madrid County Sheriff Terry Stevens, a homicide suspect is dead after a hostage situation in Marston, Missouri.

According to the Cape Girardeau/Bollinger County Major Case Squad, this was in connection to a body being found in a home in Cape Girardeau County on Wednesday, Sept. 26.

At 2:39 p.m., Cape Girardeau County Sheriff’s Deputies responded to the 2000 block of N. Old Sprigg Street Road in rural Cape Girardeau County for a well-being check.

A man was found dead inside the home. That person is identified as 35-year-old Brian E. Clemons of Cape Girardeau. Investigators said foul play was suspected. The Major Case Squad was activated. It has been deactivated as of Thursday, Sept. 27.

During the course of this investigation a male suspect was identified as 38-year-old Frinbrinzo J. Boyd. Sheriff’s Office officials said Boyd entered the residence on N. Old Sprigg St. Rd. while Clemons and a woman were sleeping.

Officials said Boyd then shot Clemens and took the woman hostage at gunpoint. Boyd and Clemons had previous arguments over the woman they had both dated in the past according to officials.

Boyd was found at the Travelodge hotel in New Madrid County and had a female hostage with him.

Members of the Missouri State Highway Patrol, MSHP Drug and Crime Division, New Madrid County Sheriff’s Office, New Madrid Police Department, Martson Police Department, and Sikeston DPS contacted the suspect at the hotel and attempted to negotiate with him. There was a hostage negotiator and the coroner’s office there as well.

After speaking with him for a period of time, investigators say the suspect died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The female hostage was unharmed.

The rooms on either side of the hostage taker’s room were evacuated.

Autopsies will be conducted on Clemons and Boyd on Friday, Sept. 28.
