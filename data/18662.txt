ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – Tuesday, the Albuquerque Police Department released images of the gun they say led to a recent deadly police shooting.

Police shot and killed 38-year-old Gilbert Zambronio-Lovato earlier this month. Police had been looking for him in connection to a string of armed robberies across the city.

They say they followed him to a Village Inn where he used a note to rob the restaurant.

Police pulled him over, and that’s when they say he pointed a gun at officers and his getaway driver. Three officers opened fire, killing him.

APD says the gun turned out to be a BB gun.

APD has asked KRQE News 13 not to release the officers’ names, saying they are undercover.

Audrey Hapke-Guzman, 35, was arrested for being Zambronio-Lovato’s accomplice during the robberies.
