A Davenport police chase resulted in a fatal car accident, killing an innocent bystander Thursday afternoon.

Police attempted a traffic stop of a vehicle driven by Angel Ochoa, 19, on Northwest Boulevard and initiated a pursuit when he didn't comply, according to a KWQC interview with Davenport Police Major Jeff Bladel.

The pursuit went westbound on Kimberly Road until, at the road's intersection with Fairmount Street, Ochoa crossed the center line at a red light, crashing into a car driven by Lori Letts, 48, of Davenport, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ochoa and the passenger in his car, Gavin Bennett, 18, were transported to Genesis East Hospital for minor injuries. No one involved in the accident was wearing a seatbelt.

The incident remains under investigation by the Iowa State Patrol.
