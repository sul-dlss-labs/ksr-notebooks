The man who was shot and killed by State Police in Salem County Saturday after opening fire on the troopers has been identified as a 19-year-old from Delaware.

Curtis Hayden Boyd Jr. of Newark, Del., had been driving one of two speeding vehicles the troopers attempted to stop at 3:40 a.m. in Mannington Township, near the Delaware River, state police said.

After a brief chase, Boyd pulled over and ran into a farm building on Route 45, where he pulled a gun and fired at the troopers, striking one in the ear and side of the face and the other in the hand, said Sgt. Stephen Jones, a state police spokesman. The troopers returned fire, killing Boyd.

Yesterday Delaware State Police also arrested the man believed to be driving the other speeding car. Charles P. Bohan, 25, of Newark, Del., was arrested and charged with "aggravated menacing" after waving a handgun at New Jersey state troopers in the parking lot of a Red Roof Inn in Newark, Del.

Police are looking for a third man who was in the car with Bohan when he waved the gun at troopers.

The officers injured during the Saturday shootout were taken to Memorial Hospital in Salem County. Trooper Luis Tomlinson, 25, received stitches in his face and ear. Trooper Matthew Szustowicz, 26, was transferred to Cooper University Hospital in Camden for treatment to his

hand, Jones said. The injuries are not life-threatening, he said.

He did not say which officer fired the shot that killed Boyd. Both officers are stationed at the Woodstown barracks and became state troopers in 2006, according to state records.

The shooting is under investigation by the state Attorney General's shooting response team.
