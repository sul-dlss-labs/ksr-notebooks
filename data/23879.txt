TAMPA â€” A 43-year-old man was killed when he lost control of his Mercedes and crashed into a cemetery early Tuesday, according to Tampa police. The agency said its officers were not chasing the driver at the time of the crash.

The incident took place at about 12:36 a.m. Tampa police said the driver, Keith Booker, was driving a gray Mercedes on westbound E Chelsea Street.

After Booker ran a stop sign, Tampa police said they activated their emergency lights and tried to pull Booker over at N 40th Street and Chelsea. But instead of pulling over, police said Booker turned off his headlights and kept speeding.

The officers said they backed away, as per department chase policy because the offense wasn't serious enough. Officers lost sight of the Mercedes, then minutes later received a report of a crash at nearby Myrtle Hill Cemetery, 4202 E Lake Ave.

They believe the driver was speeding, then lost control, left the roadway and struck two trees. He was found dead inside the Mercedes.
