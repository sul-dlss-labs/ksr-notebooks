LOS ALAMITOS, CA —One man has been shot after an hours-long standoff in Los Alamitos.

Early Thursday morning, a man—believed to be a transient—fired several shots at California Highway Patrol officers and Caltrans maintenance workers on the Katella off-ramp. He then ducked inside of a tent and refused to come out. Hours later, an officer-involved shooting occurred, leaving one man, believed to be the suspect, dead, according to CHP. As of this report, it was not clear whether the fatal shot was self-inflicted.

During the initial incident, CHP officers closed lanes of the southbound 605 freeway in response to to the initial shooting. While they negotiated for the shooter to leave his enclosure at the Katella onramp, freeway traffic backed up as far as Cerritos. Though the 605 reopened to traffic at approximately 3 p.m., the Katella on and off-ramps were still closed to traffic.

CHP Officer Todd Steaffens described the events that led to the standoff with the suspected shooter and the hours-long SIGALERT that followed. Shortly before 10 a.m. Thursday, CHP officers arrived to assist Caltrans workers for maintenance at the off-ramp, when a man—believed to be a transient—opened fire on them from a tent under some brush, Steaffens says.

It is unclear how many gunshots were fired, though no one was hurt in the initial incident, according to Steaffens. The workers retreated, and officers called for backup.

Two officers made contact with the man at about 1:30 p.m., CHP Officer Dwayne Graham said. "At that time, an officer-involved shooting occurred." No additional information was available as of this report. This is a developing report. Please refresh for the latest information.
