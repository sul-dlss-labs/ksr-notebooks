Incident at 9214 Denton

June 10, 2007 - Houston police are awaiting results of an autopsy in the death of a man following his arrest at 9214 Denton about 1:20 a.m. on Saturday (June 9).

The man, identified as Johnell Patrick (b/m, DOB 9-12-71), was pronounced dead at Ben Taub General Hospital.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant E. Gonzalez and Officers J. Selvera, D. Vasquez and R. Chappell reported:

HPD officers responding to a call at Mr. Patrick’s residence heard a scuffle inside the home. Officers were met by Patrick, who was combative and erratic. While doing a routine computer check, officers learned Patrick was wanted on city warrants and arrested him at the scene. During his transport to the city jail at 8300 Mykawa Road, Patrick continued to be combative. He was placed in jail and later found unresponsive. Houston Fire Department personnel were called to the jail and transported Patrick to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The Harris County Medical Examiner’s office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. As is customary in in-custody deaths involving HPD officers, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney’s office.
