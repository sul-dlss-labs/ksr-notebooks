David McMahon, a 49-year-old white man, was fatally shot by police Saturday, Feb. 19, in the 4600 block of Fountain Avenue in East Hollywood, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

According to LAPD Lt. Ricky Banks, officers were called around 9:30 a.m. to investigate a report of a prowler. When officers arrived they spotted McMahon, who fit the description of the suspect. He began running north along Westmoreland and then turned west on Fountain Avenue, Banks said.

Banks said that as a trio of officers were chasing McMahon, he displayed a handgun and pointed it at the officers. The officers responded by shooting the suspect.

According to coroner's records, McMahon was shot several times.

During the incident, one officer suffered non-life-threatening injuries to his face from glass fragments, Banks said. He would not elaborate.

At the scene Saturday, police cordoned off a section of sidewalk between two cars. On the ground lay a handgun as well as a number of shell casings with plastic markers placed beside them.

"It's horribly sad," said area resident Liz Dwyer, 38, who stood behind a length of police tape. "Itâ€™s awful to know that would happen."

Dwyer said the area has some gang problems, and there are many incidents of armed robberies and cars being broken into. But Dwyer said the neighborhood flies under the police radar because there aren't many reports of shootings.
