Whenever there is a shooting in the one-square-mile city, the chief said, officers are immediately sent to certain posts, and an officer in a patrol car at one of those posts found the suspect fleeing on foot. The county sheriff's office identified him as Abraham Santiago, 28, of Jersey City.

When the officer, Patrolman John Aquiar, 29, approached the suspect, the man opened fire on the officer, hitting him twice with shots from a .45-caliber pistol, once in the left shoulder and once in the chest, Chief LaBruno said. The officer's bulletproof vest prevented one bullet from penetrating his chest. Despite his shoulder wound, Patrolman Aquiar, a member of the force for seven years, chased the suspect on foot for three blocks, the chief said. He was in stable condition last night at St. Mary Hospital. ''He's thankful he's alive, and told me that it was his adrenaline pumping that caused him to chase the suspect for three blocks,'' the chief said.

A few blocks away, at Jefferson and Second Streets, the suspect put a gun to the head of a driver and stole that vehicle, the police said. Then he headed to Jersey City, which borders Hoboken.

Sheriff Joseph Cassidy of Hudson County described what happened in Jersey City. At 8:30 p.m., after an alert went out, three Hudson County sheriff's officers were on patrol near the suspect's home and spotted him. They identified themselves as officers, and the suspect started shooting at them, officials said. During a chase , which lasted several blocks, Sgt. Christian Araujo, 28, a member of the force for nine years, was shot in the abdomen. He was taken to Jersey City Medical Center, where he was in stable condition.

During the pursuit, during which numerous rounds were fired, the suspect was shot to death at Baldwin and St. Paul's Avenues in Jersey City, Sheriff Cassidy said. The police did not say how many times the suspect had been shot. His gun was recovered at the scene, the sheriff said.
