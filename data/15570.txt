DOTHAN, Alabama -- The man shot by a Dothan police officer outside an animal shelter died Tuesday night, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency confirmed.

Dothan Police Sgt. Maurice Eggleston originally told AL.com Tuesday that Robert Earl Lawrence, 30, of Dothan had suffered non-life threatening injuries in the afternoon shooting.

Lawrence was transported to Southeast Alabama Medical Center from the scene and was listed in critical condition. He died at 9:50 p.m.

Lawrence, described as being a sovereign citizen, was attempting to turn over a stray animal at the Dothan City Animal shelter at around 12:30 p.m., Eggleston said, but he became disorderly after he was told he couldn't leave the animal without showing identification.

"After repeatedly being told to calm down, Lawrence was advised he was being placed under arrest," Eggleston said. "A physical altercation ensued, to which Lawrence was shot in the abdomen (by an officer)."

Members of the sovereign movement don't prescribe to the laws of the U.S. government and follow a common law.

Instead of ID, Lawrence showed shelter workers paperwork that identified him as a sovereign citizen, Eggleston said.

The shooting is being investigated by the State Bureau of Investigation, a division of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. The findings will be turned over to the Houston County District Attorney's Office.
