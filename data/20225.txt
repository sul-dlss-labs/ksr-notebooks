A man fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy on the Barona Indian Reservation on Wednesday was from Santa Barbara, authorities said Friday.

Jeroen Peter Koornwinder, 50, died of a single gunshot wound to his upper body, sheriff’s homicide Lt. Greg Rylaarsdam said.

Two deputies fired at Koornwinder as he was accelerating his pickup to strike two other deputies at the end of a pursuit, Rylaarsdam said.

The encounter started with Tribal Enforcement officers asking deputies for help catching a man who was driving erratically on the reservation about 1:30 p.m. After a 10-minute pursuit through fields and on dirt roads, the driver stopped on Ketuull Uunyaa Way.

Two deputies tried to place a spiked Stop Stick near the pickup’s wheels, to keep him from driving off. But Rylaarsdam said the driver tried to hit those two with the truck.

After being shot, Koornwinder kept going, hitting a sheriff’s empty patrol SUV, then a Lexus that was going down the road. Three women in their 60s and 70s were injured in the collision, while a 17-year-old girl in the car was unhurt. Two of the women remained hospitalized Friday.

Koornwinder’s pickup rolled into a tree and stopped. He died before he could be taken to a hospital.
