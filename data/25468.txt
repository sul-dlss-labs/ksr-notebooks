Just before 1:30 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 20, the Garland Police Department responded to a gunshot wound in the 600 block of River Birch Trail. Responding officers were made aware there was a female who had been shot and was in the area of Basswood Trail and Mahogany Trail. The female was located and transported to the hospital. Her injuries were not life-threatening.

Officers were told that the suspect was possibly inside a residence in the 1800 block of Red Cedar Trail and was armed with a handgun and maybe a rifle. They attempted to make contact with the suspect via phone and utilizing a loud speaker but no contact was made.

Streets were blocked because the house was located on the only street that allowed access in and out of the neighborhood, and due to the location, officers felt there was an immediate threat to the residents.

SWAT responded and continued attempts to communicate with the suspect. During their communication attempts, investigators learned there was another male subject inside the home. They were able to communicate with this male and had him exit the residence.

GPD officers deployed a robot into the residence in an attempt to communicate with the suspect but the robot was not able to check the entire house. Since there was no communication with the suspect, SWAT used gas in an attempt to get the suspect to exit. There was no response so SWAT members entered the home where they found the suspect dead with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

It is believed the victim had just arrived home and her husband, the suspect, identified as 48-year-old Theodore Austin Ellis, produced a handgun and began firing at the victim. Ellis chased the victim outside where she was shot. Ellis then returned inside the residence and is believed to have committed suicide.

The investigation is ongoing.
