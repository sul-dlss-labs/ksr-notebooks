A man who assaulted a woman driver, pointed a gun at passing traffic and was shot dead by Phoenix police Monday was identified Thursday.

The Phoenix Police Department said the incident began Monday night as a domestic violence incident in a car involving Jose Manuel Cardenas, Jr., 34, and a woman they didn't identify. Police didn't describe the conflict.

Phoenix police Sgt. Mercedes Fortune said the woman, who'd been driving the car, stopped it near 37th Avenue and Camelback Road, got out and ran. She said she heard two gunshots as Cardenas also exited the car.

Fortune said it's unclear whether Cardenas shot at her or in the air, officials said. The woman called police.

Police arrived and ordered Cardenas to drop the gun. He didn't and kept walking toward open businesses, pointing the weapon at passing vehicles and himself.

An officer shot Cardenas. No officers were hurt, but the woman was, Fortune said. Police didn't specify her injury.
