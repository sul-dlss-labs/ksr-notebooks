One suspect is dead after a deputy-involved shooting in Pueblo West that happened earlier this month.

On Thursday, authorities identified the driver who reportedly hit a Fremont County patrol vehicle leading up to the deadly shooting. Alicia Antonia Martinez was arrested on a warrant for second-degree assault on a peace officer, four counts of vehicular eluding and a restraining order violation. She has been booked into the Pueblo County Jail.

The deadly encounter with law enforcement started in Fremont County on Jan. 13, where authorities say the suspects hit a Fremont County deputy's cruiser and narrowly missed a Ca√±on City police officer while speeding east on Highway 50.

Pueblo County deputies became involved after the car crossed county lines and attempted to stop the vehicle. The sheriff's office says Martinez refused to pull over and continued down Highway 50 before abruptly heading north. Deputies attempted a PIT maneuver (Pursuit Intervention Technique) and were able to push the vehicle into a field near Platteville Boulevard and Matt Drive -- only for Martinez to cross the field and get back onto the roadway. The chase wound through residential streets until a second PIT maneuver finally stopped the vehicle in a front yard on North Chaparral.

The car was still not disabled -- the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office says that when deputies walked up to the car, Martinez tried to run over a deputy. Deputies fired at the car, injuring Martinez and killing the male passenger. No law enforcement was injured.

The passenger killed was identified as 18-year-old Amiliano Apodaca.

The deputy who fired the gun has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure in officer-involved shootings. The deputy has also not been identified.
