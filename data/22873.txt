Police said a standoff at a Dallas apartment ended when a man fatally shot himself Monday night.



Dallas police said the man barricaded himself inside the unit at the Holly Park Condominiums in the 7500 Block of Holly Hill Drive at about 9 p.m. after two warrant officers tried to serve him a felony injury to a child warrant.

The officers tried to convince the man to surrender and leave the apartment for hours before they heard gunshots inside the apartment, according to officials.

Police said it appears the man is deceased due to self inflicted gun shots and confirmed the officers did not fire their weapons.

No further details have been released.
