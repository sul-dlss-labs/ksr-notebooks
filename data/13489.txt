Authorities have identified the man killed in a police-involved shooting after officers were called to help a screaming woman in Calverton earlier this week.

Elijah Glay, 39, of Takoma Park, Md., was fatally shot by a Prince George's County Police officer around 2 a.m. Wednesday outside the Lighthouse at Twin Lakes Apartments.

According to a 911 caller, the woman was screaming, "Get off me!" A witness also described hearing what he thought was the woman being struck.

Once at the scene, one of the two responding officers scaled two fences and jumped a drainage ditch to get to a bleeding female victim, police said.

As the officer approached, authorities say Glay fled the scene. The officer pursued for about a quarter mile and made multiple commands for the suspect to stop.

The officer, Corporal Tavarras Edwards, opened fire when Glay reached into a dark bag, News4's Erika Gonzalez reported.

It's unclear what Glay may have been reaching for, but no weapon was found at the scene.

Edwards is a seven-year veteran assigned to the Bureau of Patrol. He is on routine administration leave during the investigation.

The female victim was treated at the scene.

The county's Special Investigative Response Team is leading the investigation into the shooting.
