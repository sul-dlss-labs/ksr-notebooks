A man died after a shootout with law enforcement officers in Taney County.

The shooting happened after a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and a Taney County deputy went to the 200 block of Boo Boo Boulevard to talk to a man who they think was was involved in a chase with Branson police on Thursday.

A man and woman came to the door at about 2 a.m. Friday. While they were being questioned, the man pulled a gun, started shooting toward the trooper and deputy. The officers returned fire and killed the man.

The deputy and the woman suffered gunshot wounds, but their injuries were not life threatening. The trooper was not hurt.

The patrol has identified the dead man as Thomas Mone III, 46, of Galena, Mo.

Later in the morning, investigators found a suspicious device in the home and called in the Springfield Fire Department bomb squad. Technicians removed the device and planned to detonate it.
