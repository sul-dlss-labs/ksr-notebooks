A 14-year-old boy struck by a Henry County patrol car Saturday has died.

Henry County coroner Donald Cleveland told Channel 2 Action News that Chandler Jacob Weems, of McDonough, died at 9:30 a.m. Sunday at Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta at Egleston.

The officer who struck Weems, identified by the Georgia State Patrol as Denise Allyson Romano, 35, has taken a leave from the department, Henry County police said in a statement Sunday.

“On behalf of the Henry County Police Department and Police Chief (Keith) Nichols, we express our sadness and sympathy to the family for their loss,” Henry County Police Sgt. Joey Smith said in the statement.

Weems had been air-lifted to the hospital Saturday afternoon with serious injuries after being struck by the cruiser.

Smith said Romano was traveling near the intersection of North Ola and Turner Church roads around 1 p.m. Saturday when Weems exited a driveway on his bicycle and collided with the marked patrol car.

“The officer could not avoid the accident,” Smith said.

Smith said Smith was “very distraught, of course,” but was not injured.

The Georgia State Patrol is handling the investigation.
