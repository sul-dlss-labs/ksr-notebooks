JACKSON COUNTY, AL (WAFF) - A DeKalb County man being investigated for his wife's death shot himself Wednesday while authorities were trying to apprehend him.

It happened around 11 a.m. in Hollywood, Alabama.

Jackson County Sheriff Chuck Phillips said deputies spotted 28-year-old Johnny Daniel Carden's vehicle traveling on Highway 35 near the river bridge.

He said the DeKalb County Sheriff's office, along with several other agencies, were trying to arrest Carden on a murder warrant.

Deputies followed Carden several miles to Hollywood.

"He refused to stop. It wasn't no high speed chase or anything like that, he just wouldn't stop," said Sheriff Phillips.

He said Carden was traveling northbound on Alabama Highway 72 when he reportedly pulled into the median and shot himself.

Carden was a suspect in the death of his wife Jennifer. She died December 26 at their home in Henagar.

Carden was reportedly staying with relatives in Jackson County.

Authorities have sent Carden's body to Huntsville for an autopsy.

The couple's three-year-old son, who was in the car with his father, was checked out at an area hospital and was physically unhurt.
