Savannah, GA (January 24, 2020) – On Thursday, January 23, 2020, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) was requested by the Savannah Police Department to investigate an officer involved shooting that occurred on 34th Street in Savannah, Chatham County, Georgia.

Preliminary information indicates that Savannah PD responded to a home invasion call at a residence on 34th Street. The caller indicated that someone was trying to break in her home. When law enforcement officers arrived, they confronted the subject, identified as Deandre Lee Seaborough-Patterson, age 22, of Savannah GA, who was still in the yard of the residence holding a gun in his hand. The officers gave clear instructions for Patterson to drop the weapon. He did not comply with verbal commands. Patterson pointed the weapon toward the officers, and officers fired at him. Patterson was struck, and officers began to render aid. He later died at a local hospital.

A handgun was recovered at the scene. No officers were injured during the incident.

An autopsy was performed at the GBI Crime Lab in Pooler, Georgia on January 24, 2020 with preliminary results showing Patterson died of a gunshot wound.

The GBI will conduct an independent investigation to determine what occurred during the incident. When the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to the Chatham County District Attorney’s Office for review.
