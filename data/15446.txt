Authorities are investigating a fatal immigrant chase that claimed the lives of two people just north of the Rio Grande Valley.

It all happened on U.S. Highway 77 about four miles north of Riviera around 9:15 a.m. Wednesday.

Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) state troopers are investigating the accident.

State troopers reported that Border Patrol agents were chasing a green 2001 Chevrolet Tahoe.

Investigators said 22-year-old Guatemalan national Carlos Tuquer died at the scene.

The driver and seven other passengers were rushed to the Christus Spohn Hospital in Kingsville where one of the other passengers died.

Itâ€™s not clear if or when the driver will face charges but the accident remains under investigation.
