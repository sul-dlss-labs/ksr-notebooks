Joseph Holloway Says The Names Of Two People Involved In The Crash Has Been Released

A deadly high-speed chase near Glenpool ended when the driver crashed just a few feet away from a house.

The chase left behind a split power pole along Peoria and damage to Debi and Ron Morgan's gate and front yard.

Troopers said the chase started just before midnight after Okmulgee County deputies tried to stop a 2004 Cadillac driven by Adam Johnson, 37, of Mounds near 221st and Harvard.

The Oklahoma Highway Patrol said Okmulgee County deputies tried to stop Johnson for reckless driving. Instead, they said he led them on a high-speed chase.

They said his car flew into the air, split a power pole near 204th and Peoria, crashed through a gate and landed about 20 feet from the Morgan's front door.

"First thing I thought was someone had to have died in that because the car was just a crumpled mess," Debi Morgan said.

The Morganâ€™s 10-year-old granddaughter, Bailey, saw the flashing lights and told her grandparents.

They went outside and saw the car with a woman still inside.

"All of a sudden, we heard her and she didn't really say much. She was crying and she crawled out the window of the car," Debi Morgan said.

She said she's thankful it didn't come any closer to their home.

"To think just a little bit of diversion and it would've hit the house and ended up in her bedroom, so that was kind of scary," Debi Morgan said.

Johnson was thrown out of the car and died at the scene. Troopers said they expect the passenger, Tracy Frescatore, 31, to be okay.
