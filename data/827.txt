MURPHYSBORO - Three people arrested in connection with an armed robbery and kidnapping that ended in two deaths Saturday appeared in court Monday.

Christopher M. Andrews, Omar J. Moore and Chamille N. Edmonds made a first appearance before Judge David Watt in circuit court in Jackson County. They are each charged with murder, armed robbery, kidnapping and forcible detainer.

The three were arrested Saturday by Carbondale police after an attempted robbery of Midwest Cash, 1200 W. Main St., Carbondale, resulted in a high-speed car chase through Carbondale. The chase ended on Lincoln Drive at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, when Andrews, 20, of Chicago, lost control of the car and hit a tree.

The crash killed a hostage, Lucia L. Cristaudo, 55, of Carbondale, the manager of Midwest Cash; and an accomplice, Robert S. Custon, 20, of Chicago.

Moore, 19, of Carbondale, was arrested by police after a citizen called to report a suspicious vehicle.

Edmonds, 19, of Carbondale, turned herself in to police. Edmonds is a sophomore at SIUC, and is originally from Chicago, according to school records.

Watt set bond for Andrews, 20, and Moore at $100,000 each and bond for Edmonds at $25,000.

A preliminary hearing is scheduled for 9 a.m. April 10 at the Jackson County Courthouse in Murphysboro, before Judge Dan Kimmel.
