UNION COUNTY, N.C. – Four Union County deputies and one Monroe police officer are on leave after a man was fatally shot by police just before midnight Tuesday.

According to the Union County Sheriff’s Office, a deputy saw a white Pontiac traveling near Five Points in Monroe with no taillights. When the deputy attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver, identified as Joshua Adam Stubbs, fled and a chase ensued. Police said that Stubbs traveled down Walkup Avenue before turning left onto Roosevelt Boulevard and into a Dairy Queen parking lot.

Investigators said Stubbs got out of the vehicle armed with a long gun. Union County Sheriff Eddie Cathey said the weapon was a 12-gauge sawed-off shotgun. The deputy, who has not yet been identified, fired several rounds from his patrol car before Stubbs ran and barricaded himself inside a nearby Metro PCS store.

Responding officers from Union County and Monroe Police setup a perimeter around the store and attempted to contact Stubbs. After more than 20 minutes, officers were able to talk Stubbs out of the building, but Cathey alleges that Stubbs refused orders to drop his weapon. Cathey said that Stubbs was also armed with a knife during the incident.

"When he came to the door, the shotgun was cocked and brought to a level that the officers feared for their safety and they fired," Cathey said.

No serious criminal past for Stubbs. Sheriff's office still not sure why he fled. @wcnc — Hannah Welker (@hannahwelker) September 20, 2017

Stubbs was struck multiple times. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Cathey said his deputies were not wearing body cameras, but Monroe Police officers were equipped with cameras.
