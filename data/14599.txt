FLINT, MI â€“ Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton has ruled that the deadly June shooting of a 22-year-old man by Michigan State Police troopers was justified.

Police said Demetrice D. Presnall around 10:15 p.m. June 4 ran off at the Evergreen Regency apartment complex on Lippincott Boulevard after police tried to stop him for suspicious behavior.

After a short pursuit, police said Presnall pointed a gun at two Michigan State Police troopers and refused orders to put it down. Troopers then fired, killing Presnall, police and prosecutors said.

The troopers were not wearing uniforms but had clearly marked police gear, police have said.

Leyton said the fact that Presnall pointed his weapon at police officers made the shooting justifiable.

State police spokesman Lt. Brian Cole said he had no comment on the manner.

According to the Michigan Department of Corrections, Presnall was a parole absconder for a 2012 plea of no contest to a charge of attempted assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to 18 months probation and also was given credit for 14 days served in the Genesee County Jail, according to court records.

Presnall was among three men killed by police in Genesee County during a three-month span.

A trooper shot and killed 26-year-old Gary Hatcher on May 25 in Mt. Morris Township after he allegedly grabbed for the trooper's gun. Leyton has not received reports on that shooting yet, he said.

On April 17, Thomas Manuel III was killed exchanging gunfire with police after a car chase that started in Mt. Morris Township and spilled into Genesee Township. Leyton ruled that shooting justifiable earlier this year.
