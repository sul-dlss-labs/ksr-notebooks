An armed man was dead after being shot by officers in west Phoenix early Wednesday morning, police said.

Sgt. Trent Crump, Phoenix police spokesman, said the man fired several times at officers, who had responded to a report of an armed man yelling profanities and banging on doors and windows at a strip mall near 2020 N. 75th Ave.

No officers were injured, Crump said.

Crump said a worker cleaning the strip mall's parking lot called 911 about 12:30 a.m. to report the man's conduct, saying that the man was frothing at the mouth.

Firefighters arrived first. They saw the man with the gun and got the caller to safety.

According to Crump, police arrived and saw the man behind a brick pillar.

The man fired at least six shots at officers, and three to four officers fired at him, police said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The man later was identified by police as Kevin T. Marshall, 30.
