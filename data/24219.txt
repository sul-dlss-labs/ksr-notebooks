The Seminole County Sheriff’s Office released a 911 call of a road rage incident that led to a deadly officer-involved shooting in a Lake Mary’s shopping center on Tuesday night.

A man called 911 just after 7 p.m. to say he honked and yelled at man in a white SUV who cut him off on Lake Mary Boulevard near Lake Emma.

When they came to a light, the man in the SUV pulled out a gun, according to the call. The caller said the man pulled into the parking lot of the Shoppes of Lake Mary near Gators Dockside.

“I just don’t want nobody to get hurt because I don’t know what’s going on with that guy,” the caller said.

Lake Mary police officers went up to the man and ordered him out of the vehicle, deputies said. He got out and pulled out a gun, deputies said

David Romansky

Officers shot the man, identified as David M. Romansky, 34, of Longwood. Romansky was pronounced dead on scene.

The officers, who have not been identified, were not hurt.

Records show Romansky is on probation for burglary and arson.

He also was arrested last year on disorderly intoxication and resisting arrest charges after an incident at Rachel’s Gentelman’s Club in Casselberry when he was accused of pulling out a knife. He also kicked the inside of the police cruiser while in the back seat, the affidavit said. The charges were later dropped.
