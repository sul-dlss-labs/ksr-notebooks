ATLANTA - A Fulton County jailer is charged with involuntary manslaughter after accidentally shooting another jailer and killing her.



Twenty-eight-year-old Dean Ricketts was acting out scenarios he learned in training Sunday night in southwest Atlanta.



A single gunshot killed 23-year-old Mychiska Patterson, a jailer who had worked for the Fulton County sheriff's department for two years.



Atlanta police say Ricketts had removed the magazine from the .40-caliber Glock pistol he was using in the role-playing game, but a bullet remained in the chamber.



Ricketts -- as a detention officer -- was not authorized to carry a firearm, and the gun was not sheriff's department property, officials say.



Ricketts had completed 14 weeks of a 16-week class. He worked at the jail less than a year. Patterson -- a jail employee two years -- was not enrolled in the class.



The shooting is still under investigation.
