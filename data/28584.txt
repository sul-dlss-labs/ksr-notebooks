PUEBLO, Colo. (AP) — A Colorado woman was killed by police Tuesday after an alleged home invasion in Pueblo, authorities said.

Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter identified the woman as Lyana Gilmore, 48, of Pueblo.

The Pueblo Police Department responded to a call Tuesday around 10:20 p.m. of an in-progress home invasion in the city’s West Side, about 112 miles (180 kilometers) south of Denver, The Pueblo Chieftain reported.

Capt. Kenny Rider said the caller reported that a woman allegedly broke into the home with a handgun and threatened the residents, who did not know the suspect.

“There were four people inside the home. By the time officers got there, three of the four occupants were out of the house,” Rider said. “An elderly man was still inside the home with the suspect. He was never able to make it out because he has some disabilities and wasn’t able to move quickly.”

The officers were working out logistics when Gilmore abruptly came out of the home where she was confronted by officers, authorities said. Officers ordered her to drop her firearm, but she refused and kept approaching officers.

The three officers then fired at Gilmore. She died at the scene. No one else was injured.

“The elderly male came out right after the shooting happened. The officers were able to get him to safety and away from the house,” Rider said.

The 10th Judicial District Critical Incident Team is investigating. The three officers who fired their weapons were placed on administrative leave, pending an investigation.
