Four Rohnert Park police officers have been cleared of any wrongdoing in the death of a suspect who passed away after he was stunned by a Taser.

A report released Thursday by Sonoma County prosecutors said 42-year-old Guy James Fernandez died last November from cardiac arrest caused by toxic levels of methamphetamine.

The report also said the Taser officers used on Fernandez had a low charge.

Sgt. Dale Utecht and Officers Jared Malec, Andrew Smith and Tara Douglas tried to arrest Fernandez on suspicion of shoplifting on Nov. 9, 2008. He was hit with a Taser when he apparently became combative and resisted arrest.

Officers later noticed Fernandez was unresponsive. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.
