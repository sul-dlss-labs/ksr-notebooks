A woman was shot and killed in an officer-involved shooting in Montgomery after police responded to a stolen vehicle call in the 100 block of Kiwanis Street.

Two officers responded to a stolen vehicle call when the vehicle accelerated to leave the scene. One officer was dragged under the vehicle. The other officer fired at the vehicle, fatally shooting the female driver.

The woman was the only person in the car, Montgomery Police Department Capt. Regina Duckett said.

The officer who was hit by the car was transported to hospital for non-life-threatening injuries.

"The Montgomery Police Department responded to a suspected stolen vehicle in the 100 block of Kiwanis Street late morning," MPD reported on its Facebook page. "As officers approached the vehicle on foot, it accelerated, dragging one of the officers under the vehicle. A second officer fired at the vehicle, fatally wounding the driver, an adult female."

The State Bureau of Investigation will take over the probe, which is standard procedure with an officer involved shooting.

The block of Kiwanis Street remained cordoned off Tuesday afternoon as investigators worked the scene.

The fatal officer-involved shooting was the second in as many months. A Montgomery police officer was placed on leave after he shot and killed a person Feb. 21.

Three people in total, including a police officer, were shot during the series of events that stemmed from an afternoon "subject shot" call in the 1600 block of Westcott Street. Administrative leave is normal protocol for officer-involved shootings.
