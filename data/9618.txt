The surviving suspect in Wednesday night's deputy-involved shooting at a Plantation Oaks home is a juvenile who remains hospitalized at Shands Jacksonville.

The Clay County Sheriff's Office will only say he is younger than 18 and hasn't been charged yet in the 10:30 p.m. series of shootings that started with an apparent burglary gone bad.

A 33-year-old house-sitter, Leroy McDonald, was killed before a Clay deputy arrived to find two armed suspects. He shot them both, wounding the unidentified juvenile and killing 24-year-old Todd Allen Bradshaw Jr.

Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Mary Justino said the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating. Neither agency would release more details.

Neighbors had called to report suspicious vehicles at the home, where a burglary occurred a couple of days before and the owner was deployed overseas, the Sheriff's Office previously said. As deputies were on their way, more calls came regarding shots fired. When the first deputy arrived, he confronted the suspects.
