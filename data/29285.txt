GATES, Ore. — A Linn County deputy and three Oregon State Police troopers were involved in a fatal shooting of a robbery suspect late Tuesday night, according to Salem police, who are leading the investigation into the shooting.

The shooting happened around 11:45 p.m. about five miles east of Gates. Police said no deputies or troopers were injured.

The man who was killed was identified as 27-year-old Brad Tyler Masters, of Bend. He was declared dead at the scene of the shooting.

Law enforcement first tried to apprehend the suspect, later identified as Masters, in Bend, when deputies from the Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office responded to two robberies and a stolen vehicle. Deputies chased the suspect west on Highway 22 but stopped the pursuit on the eastern side of Santiam Pass, Salem police said. The Deschutes County Sheriff’s Office sent out an “attempt to locate” the vehicle to other law enforcement agencies.

The suspect vehicle was located, and Oregon State Police (OSP) troopers and a Linn County Sheriff’s deputy took over the pursuit. The chase ended after the suspect drove over spike strips that were put out near Gates, according to Salem police.

Masters left the vehicle and “a confrontation ensued, and three troopers and a Linn County deputy fired shots,” Salem police said in a press release.

The three OSP troopers who fired shots were identified as Caleb Yoder, Michael Iacob and Joseph Sousa. The Linn County Sheriff’s deputy who fired his gun was identified as Brandon Rathelegurche. Each officer has been placed on administrative leave, per standard protocol for each agency.
