PRICHARD â€” One man is dead and an Alabama police officer is injured after both were struck by a police car during an early morning chase.

A statement from the Mobile County Sheriff's Office says Prichard police officer Simeon Beeson attempted to pull over a car for a traffic violation about 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.

The statement says a driver identified as James Burford refused to pull over and a chase began.

The sheriff's department says the car wrecked and Burford and Beeson were both on foot when they were struck by a patrol car driven by another police officer, Jay Wilson. Burford was killed and Beeson was injured.

The sheriff's department says it already has concluded an investigation, and Wilson won't be charged.

Officials haven't released Beeson's condition.
