A Chattooga County deputy killed a man Sunday night after showing up to his house in relation to a "domestic call," Sheriff Mark Schrader said in a news release.

The Sheriff's Office has not released the names of the deputy or the man he killed or the specific location of the shooting. Members of the Georgia Bureau of Investigations are looking into the incident, as is standard practice for a deputy-involved shooting.

Around 9 p.m. Sunday, according to Schrader's release, a pair of deputies went to a house on Taliaferro Springs Road just outside Lyerly, Ga., after getting a "domestic call." One deputy stayed there, where the caller was, and another deputy went to find another man who was involved in the incident.

After arriving at that second location, the unnamed deputy knocked on the door and windows. Soon, according to the release, the deputy heard footsteps and saw a silhouette walk past one window, toward the back door.

Then, the deputy heard a man screaming. The man rounded the corner and faced the deputy, an SKS-style rifle in his hand. The man fired a shot at the deputy, according to the release. He missed.

The deputy ordered the man to put the gun down. The man didn't, according to the release. He aimed the gun toward the deputy, but the deputy fired his own gun first. With that one shot, he killed the man.
