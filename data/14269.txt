An investigation was underway after a man was found dead following a standoff in an Azusa neighborhood Sunday that left some residents unable to return to their home for a brief time, authorities said.

The incident began around 3:00 p.m. in the 800 block of East Pepper Tree Drive (map) when police attempted to arrest the 19-year-old on narcotics warrants, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

He eluded authorities and went to a condominium that belonged to a relative, deputies said.

Azusa police officers contained the location, but the man was able to escape by exiting through the second floor of the unit and running across rooftops of adjacent buildings, the release stated.

He eventually entered another nearby condominium by diving through a window, authorities said.

Police received information that there were firearms inside the location, and a SWAT team was called out to the scene, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

When the SWAT Team entered the residence, they discovered the man dead “from apparent injuries sustained during his jump through a window,” the release said.

The man was identified as Alec Deon Torres of San Dimas, according to Lt. Fred Corral of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

During the standoff, residents in the area were requested to stay indoors while police searched the area, a tweet from the Azusa Police Department stated.

Some residents who were away from their homes at the time were not allowed back into their residences until 8:30 p.m., according to a separate tweet from police.

Anyone with information about the incident was asked to contact the Sheriff Department’s Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.
