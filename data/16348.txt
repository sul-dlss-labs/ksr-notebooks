A man who died after he was shot in the head Friday afternoon on the Far South Side by a police officer was the second man in less than 24 hours shot dead by Chicago Police.

Gang Investigations officers tried to pull over a vehicle in the 10600 block of South Cottage Grove about 4 p.m. after learning someone inside was a wanted suspect, according to a statement from police News Affairs.

After they pulled over the vehicle, a man inside took out a handgun and pointed it at police, the statement said. An officer then shot the man, who was placed into custody and taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.

Eugene McSwain, 25, died at the hospital at 6:38 a.m. Saturday, according to the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

An autopsy found McSwain, who lived in the 7400 block of South King Drive, died of a gunshot wound to his head and his death was ruled a homicide, according to the medical examiner’s office.

Authorities recovered a weapon at the scene, police said. No officers were hurt.

Karen Bates, 55, lives a block behind where the shooting took place. Bates said she heard police vehicles chasing the car, then heard one of the vehicles brake hard.

She heard one officer say, “”Put your hands up! Put your hands up! He’s reaching for something!” before one gunshot was fired.

Bates said she walked closer to see what had happened and saw police removing a male from the front seat of the vehicle.

Another man was shot dead by Chicago Police less than 24 hours earlier.

Martice Miller, 27, was fatally shot late Thursday after he aimed a firearm at an officer in Greater Grand Crossing, officials said.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating both shootings.
