A Hart County man is in critical condition in a Macon hospital after authorities said he shot himself during a traffic stop near Milledgeville.

Stuart Sinclair Wiggins, 58, of Royston remained Wednesday in Navicent Medical Center in Macon, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is assisting in the investigation.

The shooting occurred about 2:50 p.m. Tuesday after a Baldwin County sheriff’s deputy responded to a citizen’s report of a person driving erratically on Georgia Highway 212, according to the GBI.

A deputy responded and during the ensuing traffic stop, the driver pulled into the parking lot of the Central Georgia Technical Institute campus located off Georgia Highway 22, authorities said.

As the deputy approached the vehicle, he observed that the driver had shot himself.

Wiggins was transported by helicopter to the Macon hospital.
