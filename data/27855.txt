PHILADELPHIA (CBS) - A man was killed and a woman was injured during a Philadelphia police-involved shooting in Grays Ferry on Friday morning, after a weapon was pointed at the officers. The two officers were not hurt.

Shortly after midnight, police responded to a report of gunshots on the 1500 block of Bailey Street. When officers arrived, they saw a 33-year-old man and a 22-year-old woman in an alleyway behind the homes.

Police say the woman pointed her weapon at the officers. That's when, police say, the officers fired their weapons at the two suspects, striking the woman in the thigh and the man in the stomach.

The officers chased them inside a residence and apprehended them. The suspects were then rushed to Penn Presbyterian Hospital.

The man died at the hospital while the woman is currently in stable condition.

"The use of deadly force is the most serious action that police officers are empowered to undertake," said Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw. "While no police officer begins his or her tour expecting to discharge their firearm, that decision must sometimes be made at a moment's notice. These situations are often tragic; particularly when they result in the loss of life. As is the case with all Officer-Involved Shootings, we will ensure that a thorough, complete and objective investigation is conducted."

Police say the woman threw a semi-automatic handgun under a kitchen table, which officers did recover. Officers also recovered another semi-automatic handgun and a shotgun inside the house. Investigators found several spent shotgun shells both inside and outside the house.

The officers will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
