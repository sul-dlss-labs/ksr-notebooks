Officers say he led them on pursuit, pointed gun



The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office continues to investigate the death of a former Beacon man, Bradley G. Pullman, 48, who was shot dead by police officers on Sunday (April 26) in Wayne. On June 9, the state posted video of the killing taken from police vehicles.

The attorney general said in a statement that at about 4:30 p.m., an officer from the Mountain Lakes Police Department attempted to pull over a Lexus sedan after he saw it perform an illegal U-turn over the median of a divided highway.

Police said the car did not stop and a pursuit ensued involving two other police departments. It ended about 17 minutes later at the interchange of Routes 46 and 23, and Interstate 80 when Pullman stopped his vehicle and began to get out. Officers said he was aiming a pistol at a police vehicle, and four officers fired in response.

In its statement, the Office of the Attorney General said that, after officers removed Pullman from the car, they found a loaded .380-caliber pistol near the driver’s seat. He was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency medical responders.

Police initially identified Pullman as a resident of Beacon because he had a Beacon address on his driver’s license but said on June 15 that he was living in Queens at the time of his death. A private funeral service was held on April 30 in Paramus, New Jersey.

Under state law, when the investigation is complete, the case will be presented to a grand jury to decide whether criminal charges should be filed. However, the convening of grand juries has been temporarily suspended because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Attorney General’s office said.

The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office is also investigating the shooting of a Poughkeepsie man, Maurice Gordon, 28, by a state trooper on May 23. Gordon was shot and killed on the Garden State Parkway in the township of Bass River.
