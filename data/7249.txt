When Craig Greenlaw heard tires screech to a sudden stop early Sunday morning outside his apartment building, followed by shouting and gunfire, he screamed to a relative to call police.

Greenlaw's nephew, Shapell Terrell, and several children were outside the building at East 85th Street and South Oglesby Avenue at 1 a.m. Sunday, and he feared gang fighting was under way.

Greenlaw, 50, said he ran to look out his first-floor window -- and he saw they didn't need to call police.

"I looked outside and saw Pell," Greenlaw said, using Terrell's family nickname. "It was the police."

Chicago Police Officer John Henry said Terrell confronted police with a gun before he was shot. Two guns were later found at the scene, said Mark Payne, a spokesman for the Independent Police Review Authority. The shooting is being reviewed by the independent agency, which is routine with all shootings.

Terrell, 39, of Hammond, died at the entrance of the two-story building, where all four apartments were filled with his family members, including Greenlaw.

Family members said it isn't possible that Terrell could have had a gun in each hand and opened fire with children around. They said that police told them they were responding to a report of shots fired in the neighborhood, but that all they heard were fireworks.

Nina Eskridge, 20, said her father worked hard at a sanitation job to help support his seven children, of which she is the oldest.

"He worked as a garbage man to take care of his kids," Eskridge said, standing where her father died and holding his photo. "His kids came first. He was a very kind man."
