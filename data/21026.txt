From Times Wire Reports

A man died in Kentwood after breaking into the home of a woman he had been convicted of stalking. He set off an explosive device after police cornered him in the basement. Five officers were slightly injured, police said.

One of the officers shot Jeffrey H. Bothee, 52, as he tried to detonate a second device attached to his body. It was unclear whether he was shot to death or suffered fatal injuries from the first explosion. An autopsy will be performed.

Bothee was convicted in July of stalking the woman, an ex-girlfriend. He was sentenced in September to two years of probation.
