Asheville Police Chief Bill Hogan continues to call the shooting self-defense, noting that the APD does not prohibit firing at moving vehicles.

A man shot dead by an Asheville police officer was struck four times from the front or side, preliminary police results of an autopsy performed July 11 indicate.

According to police, Lacy Pickens III, 27, of Taft Avenue was attempting to run over officers with a car when he was shot by Officer Chad Bridges about 11:05 p.m. July 6 in the parking lot of Cracker Barrel restaurant in West Asheville.



Bridges reportedly shot Pickens after the latter reversed his car, hitting the front tire of a police car and knocking down Sgt. Danny Holden.



In the aftermath, Pickens?? family members have complained to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, drawing outrage at the shooting from its president, John Hayes. He questioned the attitude of police officers and alleged that they fail to put a value on a person??s life.





Meanwhile, Pickens?? father, Lacy Pickens Jr., reportedly disputed the police version of the events and said he counted six bullet wounds on his son, including one to his back.



Conversely, Dr. John Henderson, Buncombe??s medical examiner, said Winston-Salem doctors reported finding four gunshot wounds during the autopsy ?? one to the chest, two to the right arm and one to the head. He added that all appeared to have come from the side or front.



Pickens is survived by three children ?? two of whom were living with his wife from whom he was separated, and a daughter for whom he was the caregiver. The daughter is now with relatives.



As a matter of routine procedure in shootings by police, the State Bureau of Investigation is scrutinizing the incident.



Also as a matter of routine, Bridges was put on paid leave during the SBI probe, while Holden, the officer who was knocked down but suffered no serious injuries, returned to duty.



Two Buncombe residents

killed by sheriff??s deputies



In separate incidents, two area residents were shot by deputies from the Buncombe County Sheriff??s Department last Thursday night. Both individuals had pointed guns at deputies, according to Sheriff Bobby Medford.



The killings raise the totals shootings by local law enforcement officers to three in roughly a week, including the death on July 10 of Lacy Pickens III after he was fatally shot by Asheville police officer Chad Bridges on July 6.



Last Thursday??s shooting deaths involved a Weaverville man at his home and a teenager in Leicester.



Gregory Keith Hensley, about 46, was shot outside his home on Dula Springs Road near Weaverville ?�when officers attempted to serve an outstanding warrant for his arrest,?? the department said in a statement.



Although Medford reported that Hensley was killed with a single shot, Jerry Weese, a relative of Hensley??s said that three shots were fired, a claim reinforced by the presence of three bullet holes in the wall near where the shooting take place.



However, while family members disputed the number of shots fired, they reportedly did not blame the killing on the deputies.



The original warrant stemmed from an incident earlier in the day, when Hensley allegedly pointed a gun at Weese??s stepson.



In a separate incident, Terry Jackson Evans, about 17, was shot and killed at his mother??s home in Poor Man??s Hollow in the Dix Creek area of Leicester. Officers were responding to a threatened suicide.



The deputy shot Evans after the latter struggled with his mother over a shotgun he was carrying. The mother had called the Sheriff??s Department because Evans was threatening suicide, according to officials.



Prior to the incident, Evans repordedly was seen walking with a gun that neighbors said was either a shotgun or rifle.



The deputy was in the home??s driveway when he heard a shot fired from behind him, police said. At that point, Evans?? mother came out of the house and attempted to wrestle the shotgun away from him.



Evans then reportedly pointed the shotgun at the deputy, who fired a single shot at him with his pistol.

However, Evans?? mother, Tammy Revis, disputes the deputy??s claim that her son was in possession of the gun when he was shot.



Revis told authorities that she had the gun firmly in her hands and Evans was on the ground when the deputy came over, stomped on his chest five times and then shot him.



The official account also conflicts with reports from neighbors who claimed that three shots were fired ?? first a loud shotgun blast and then two quieter pistol shots.



The department said the State Bureau of Investigation was contacted and is investigating both incidents. As per the sheriff??s department policy, ?�both officers are currently on administrative leave.??



Officials said they did not know what charges were pending against Hensley.



Chronic offenders termed

biggest downtown problem



The judicial system is overwhelmed, resulting in chronic problems with repeat offenders in downtown Asheville, city Police Chief Bill Hogan told the Citizen??s Police Advisory Committee on July 13.



The meeting was focused on giving ideas to reduce downtown crime. The panel, appointed by City Council, holds periodic meetings at various locations around the city. This fall, ideas and recommendations will be compiled and submitted to council.



As for downtown problems, Hogan cited drugs, homelessness and noise. Asheville Police Lt. Wallace Welch later added that 20 chronic offenders were arrested or cited 800 times by city police last year.



To reduce the number of repeat offenders, Hogan recommended stricter use by city courts of the statute known as ?�three strikes and you??re out.??
