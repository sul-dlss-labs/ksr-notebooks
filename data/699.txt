"This was a vicious thing because the woman didn't even have a chance. She couldn't even get up and help herself because she was already down," says Julie Clements.

Witnesses in Jennings say they watched in horror as 54-year-old Myrle Benoit dragged his live-in girlfriend out of a local lounge.

They say Benoit was beating 42-year-old Carla Landry and then things went from bad to worse. "He got out of the truck and laid her body to where her body was in a diagonal, and he kept running over her three or four times," Clements says.

She says Benoit then fled down the road in his truck. Jennings police say at that point, Benoit returned home, told Landry's daughter her mother was dead and then went out to leave again. It was then, police say Benoit saw officers approaching. He fled again, and officers chased him for a little more than a block, before he ran through a stop sign and into an oncoming truck. That truck then hit another. Nearby workers heard the collision.

"It was real loud," Samantha Brown says. "It was pretty loud. I heard it over a vacuum cleaner." The impact of the crash killed Benoit. The drivers of the other trucks escaped with minor injuries. Jennings residents are still trying to deal with the two deaths.

"You know it's horrifying that our state of life is so filled with anger, instead of love and participation and trying to help one another," Clements says. Help that could've saved Landry's life.

Jennings police say they stopped Benoit Wednesday night for traffic violations. They say he mentioned he and Landry had been arguing.
