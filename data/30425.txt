A 911 call about a disturbance in Tamarac ended with a man killing himself following several hours of negotiations with Broward Sheriff’s Office crisis negotiators, authorities said.

Around 12.40 p.m. Monday, Regional Communications received a call regarding a disturbance in the 8000 block of Lagos de Campo, inside a Tamarac residential community, according to BSO. When deputies arrived, the adult male, believed to be armed, barricaded himself in the home and refused to come out, deputies said.

“Members from the BSO SWAT team and crisis negotiators responded to the scene,” said BSO spokesperson Claudinne Caro in an email. “After several hours of negotiations that ran into the next morning, on Tuesday, June 15, detectives entered the home and found the subject deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.”

Homicide and Crime Scene detectives responded to assist with the investigation, Caro said.
