East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola had already wrapped up his extra-duty shift at the B-Quik convenience store, but he'd hung around the shop while waiting to meet his wife, whom he'd greeted with a text — "Good morning, my love" — an hour earlier.

Next door at Benny's Car Wash, Cpl. Montrell Jackson — known for keeping his car shining and his uniform spotless — had taken a few minutes on that Sunday morning to clean his patrol car and put air in the tires.

Matthew Gerald, a 41-year-old rookie Baton Rouge cop who'd joined the force after years in the military, sat in his patrol car at an Airline Highway red light, waiting to make the left turn into the convenience store parking lot to pick up a couple of energy drinks.

It was just around 8:30 a.m. on July 17. A white Chevrolet Malibu pulled up next to Gerald at the light on Airline Highway. Behind the wheel was a troubled 29-year-old ex-Marine named Gavin Eugene Long, who'd arrived in Baton Rouge five days before. In Long's rental car were two semiautomatic rifles, a 9mm handgun and a rambling suicide note that spoke of "horrendous acts of violence" and his growing rage toward the police.
