An Eau Claire, Wis., man who was drunk when he fled from Sparta police on Nov. 24 and crashed head on into another car, killing the driver and injuring his passenger, was convicted Wednesday of a homicide charge.

Steven M. Johnson, 32, pleaded no contest to homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle and attempting to flee a traffic officer causing death in Monroe County Circuit Court.

A charge of injury by intoxicated use of a vehicle was dismissed but can be considered by the judge at sentencing, while other charges and tickets were dismissed, District Attorney Kevin Croninger said.

Johnson will be sentenced Nov. 6.

Johnson fled from police about 3 a.m. at speeds up to 70 mph during a 3½-mile pursuit after an officer tried to stop him for speeding and erratic driving, according to the complaint.

His 2008 Chrysler Sebring crossed the center line of Jancing Avenue and collided at 60 mph with an oncoming car driven by Jose Luz Flores-Procel, 34, of Sparta, who died at the scene, according to the complaint and a Wisconsin State Patrol reconstruction report.

Flores-Procel was traveling at 58 mph just before the crash. Both drivers applied their brakes before the collision.

The officer extinguished a fire in Johnson’s car before he and passenger Thomas Stewart, 37, of Milwaukee were extricated and flown to Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center.

Officers smelled alcohol on Johnson, who told paramedics that he had “too much to be driving,” the complaint states. He had a 0.16 percent alcohol level. Police said they also smelled alcohol on Flores-Procel.

Johnson told authorities he had been at the Breakaway bar in Sparta but did not remember the pursuit or the crash, according to the reconstruction report. He denied driving.

Johnson was convicted of drunken driving in 2004.
