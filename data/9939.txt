ST. LOUIS • A city police officer has admitted using his cellphone to take the crime scene photograph that was leaked from a deadly shootout two weeks ago, St. Louis police department officials said Monday.

In a news release, police said the officer, a member of the department's Special Weapons and Tactics Team, admitted Friday to taking the photo. The officer, who has not been named, has been taken off the SWAT team, police said Monday. No other disciplinary action had been taken against him, police said.

The photo was taken in a house in the 3100 block of Osage Street, where Carlos Boles exchanged gunfire the morning of March 8 with members of the department and the U.S. Marshals Service. Deputy U.S. Marshal John Perry, 48, who had been with the agency for nearly 10 years, died after being shot in the head. A city police officer, Jeff Helbling, and another marshal, Theodore Abegg, were wounded. Boles was killed in return fire. City police and the Marshals Service had been at the home to serve arrest warrants on Boles on charges of assaulting a police officer and a drug offense.

In the photo, Boles' bullet-riddled body is seen on the floor of the second-story unit of the two-family flat. Last week, the department released a statement calling the photo distasteful and vowing discipline if a city police officer was found to be responsible.

"Our department's policies are crystal clear — the only photos our personnel are to take at any crime scene are those that are for investigative purposes," the statement read. "Anything otherwise is completely inappropriate and unacceptable. Actions like this threaten the professionalism and integrity of all law enforcement."

The photo was forwarded to others through the officer's cellphone. Investigators are working to determine who received copies of the image. Some media outlets received copies of the photo but did not use it.
