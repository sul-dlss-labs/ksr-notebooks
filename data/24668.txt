PINE BLUFF, Ark. (AP) - The Arkansas State Police is investigating a shooting in which a man was killed after allegedly pointing a weapon at officers from the Pine Bluff Police Department.

Authorities say officers were responding to a disturbance call in Pine Bluff Friday night when they encountered 34-year-old Danny Lee outside a home.

Police say Lee had a gun and pointed it at officers as they tried to take him into custody.

Lee died at the scene. No officers were injured.

State police will submit the results of its investigation to prosecutors in Jefferson County, who will determine whether the use of deadly force by the officers was justified.
