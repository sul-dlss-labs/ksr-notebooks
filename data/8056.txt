Gene Valdez, an 18-year-old Latino, was shot multiple times and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies Sunday, April 26, in the 800 block of North Santa Fe Avenue in Compton, authorities said.

According to sheriff's officials, Valdez had robbed a fast-food restaurant in the 500 block of East Rosecrans Avenue about 2:20 a.m. before fleeing the location. A witness to the robbery flagged down deputies responding to the call and directed them to Valdez, sheriff's officials said.

Deputies chased Valdez on foot. In the 800 block of North Santa Fe Avenue, "The suspect turned and faced them, pointing what appeared to be a black, semi-automatic handgun," according to a sheriff’s statement.

Two deputies shot Valdez multiple times in the upper torso and he died at the scene. The deputies later discovered that the man’s weapon was a replica of a semi-automatic pistol, the sheriff’s statement said.

Internal affairs and homicide investigators are interviewing the two deputies about the shooting, said sheriff’s spokesman Oscar Butao.
