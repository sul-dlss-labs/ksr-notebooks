Suspect who was holding elderly woman at knifepoint killed by police in Mar Vista

MAR VISTA, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A suspect who was holding an elderly woman at knifepoint at a Mar Vista apartment was killed in an officer-involved shooting, according to LAPD.

Authorities said officers responded to the 3700 block of Barry Avenue just before 6 a.m. They were responding to a radio call with someone saying they could hear screaming in a nearby apartment, LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar said.

When officers arrived on scene, they observed a man holding an elderly woman at knifepoint, Aguilar said, and an officer-involved shooting occurred.

The suspect, a man in his 50s, was shot by officers and declared dead at the scene. The knife has been recovered.

Aguilar stated during a press conference that the suspect and the victim were related, and the suspect was trying to force the woman to take him to another location.

LAPD initially stated that officers were responding to a burglary call, but now say the suspect and victim knew each other, although the exact relationship has not been disclosed.

The suspect's name has not been released. Police say the elderly woman was not injured.
