Police have identified 18-year-old Jayden Young as the teen who was shot dead by a Glendale police officer who was trying to break up a fight Friday afternoon.

Among the revelations Monday, police said it wasn't clear whether Young had fired at Officer Andrew Johnson, although the official narrative following the shooting made it a certainty.

Police say Young was among four men who were fighting roadside around 3 p.m. when Johnson encountered them on routine patrol.

Johnson heard two gunshots before exiting his vehicle and saw Young continue to shoot at two men as he ran away, police said. A police statement Monday said Johnson "returned fire ... for the safety of the victims."

A 17-year-old ran from the scene but officers caught up with him a short time later. Police said Young drove away in a silver vehicle that had previously been reported stolen.

Of the two men who remained at the scene, one had life-threatening injuries due to a gunshot. He was taken to a hospital in critical condition, where he remained Monday.

Young, meanwhile, crashed the vehicle into the front yard of a residence in the 5700 block of north 63rd Avenue. His body was found in the backyard.

Sgt. Scott Waite said Young's gunshot wound did not appear to be self-inflicted.
