A Gallatin County Sheriff's deputy was justified when he shot and killed a man earlier this year, according to a grand jury ruling Monday.

Sheriff's Deputy Edwin Campbell responded to a Boone County residence for the report of an intoxicated man April 12, according to a news release from the Commonwealth of Kentucky.

Gary Burdine, 41, allegedly approached the deputy when he was leaving and said he was going to shoot him, the release states.

Burdine then pulled out a pistol and Campbell shot at him four times, the release states.

Burdine died with a blood alcohol content between 0.224 and 0.290, the release states.

The Gallatin County Grand Jury reviewed evidence in the case Monday and determined "the use of deadly force by Gallatin County Sheriff's Deputy Edwin Caldwell was justified."

The grand jury ruling comes after a four-month investigation by the Kentucky State Police.

Caldwell has returned to duty with the sheriff's office.
