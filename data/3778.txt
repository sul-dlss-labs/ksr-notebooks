A McHenry County coroner's inquest revealed Tuesday that a Crystal Lake man was shot eight times in his upper body by Crystal Lake police after a high-speed chase in November.

Two Illinois State Police officers who investigated the shooting testified before the jury, and authorities said nine bullets could have hit Craig Cronyn, 31, because it is unclear what caused an abrasion on his chin, said Paula Gallas, an investigator with the coroner's office.

"They said there would be answers," said Cronyn's mother, Karen, who traveled from Texas to attend the inquest. "We just have too many questions."

Last month, State's Atty. Lou Bianchi announced that the five Crystal Lake police officers involved were justified in shooting Cronyn because they feared for their safety.

The officers fired 23 shots, killing Cronyn in his truck the night of Nov. 16.

Cronyn, who had been drinking heavily and had assaulted his girlfriend and her 6-year-old son at their apartment in the 500 block of Darlington Lane, fled in a pickup when police arrived, authorities said. He led them on a 9-mile chase that ended in gunfire in a residential neighborhood, officials said.

State Police Special Agent William Kroncke testified that Cronyn had aimed his pickup at the officers several times and sped toward them at more than 100 m.p.h.

"They initiated fire to stop the threat," Kroncke said. "Upon hearing the truck de-accelerate and Mr. Cronyn's head fall downward in that fashion, they ceased fire."
