A suspect was shot and killed by Denver police Tuesday evening after officers responded to a burglary in progress at a home in the 1800 block of South Alcott Street.

Police spokesman Jay Casillas said no officers were injured in the incident on Denver’s west side, which occurred shortly before 6 p.m. He said officers were inside a home on South Alcott Street when the suspect “produced a knife” and was then shot by “officers.” Casillas did not know how many officers may have fired at the suspect.

The suspect was taken to an area hospital, where he died. Casillas said police believe that a “series of crimes” led to the confrontation Tuesday evening.

He was unable to provide further details about the incident and did not release the name of the suspect.

The shooting comes during a particularly tough couple of months for the law enforcement community, which has seen three Colorado sheriff’s deputies killed in the line of duty during a period spanning less than six weeks.
