One of the children who was hospitalized following a crash that killed two others near downtown Casper two weeks ago has died.

Lillian Dorman, 3, passed away Thursday in Colorado. Her parents were by her side as her breathing tube was removed.

Her eight-year-old brother and her father both survived the crash. The brother suffered a broken arm, but has since been released from the hospital.

A Wyoming Highway Patrol trooper tried to stop a black Ford Focus on Thursday, July 6, for speeding. The Focus took off and sped through the intersection at First and Poplar, where it hit a pickup carrying the Dormans.

Both 39-year-old Douglas W. Arthur and 34-year-old Lyle Tsinnijinnie died in the crash.
