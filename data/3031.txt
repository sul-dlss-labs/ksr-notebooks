A motorcyclist killed in a crash while a police officer was trying to pull him over in Petaluma was identified as Jose Francisco Martinez, 32, of Rancho Cordova, Sonoma County coroner officials said Monday.

Martinez and his brother, Josue Reynaldo, were riding bikes on the southeastern outskirts of Petaluma about 5:15 p.m. Sunday, prompting a 911 call from someone who said the bikers were speeding, according to California Highway Patrol officials who are investigating the fatal crash because it occurred during a police pursuit.

An officer pulled up behind the bikers in a marked police SUV on Ely Boulevard South near Frates Road and tried to pull them over using lights and sirens, CHP Officer Jon Sloat said. The bikers rode on at a high rate of speed, heading south on Ely Boulevard South, officials said. About a mile down the road near Browns Lane one of the bikers, Reynaldo, abruptly stopped, forcing the officer to swerve around him to avoid a collision, according to Sloat.

The officer continued pursuing the other rider and “by the time the officer crested a hill (Martinez) had already crashed,” Sloat said.

Martinez apparently lost control, and the motorcycle laid down on its side and skidded through the intersection, crashing in a ditch and ejecting the rider, CHP officials said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Reynaldo, 25, also of Rancho Cordova followed the officer to the crash scene. He appeared to be intoxicated and was taken to the Petaluma police station and arrested. He was booked into the Sonoma County Jail and released on bail.
