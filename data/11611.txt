PHILADELPHIA (CBS) â€“ A suspect is dead after police intervened in a gun battle.

The incident happened at N 2nd St & W Nedro Avenue in Olney around 1 a.m. on Monday morning.

Two police officers in a marked car were traveling south on 2nd Street towards Nedro when they saw a male firing a gun at an SUV. The police officers stopped their car and announced themselves, but the male suspect pointed his gun at the officers.

One of the police officers fired once, shooting the male suspect in the head.

The 25-year-old man was taken to Einstein Hospital in extremely critical condition, where he later died of his injuries.

Police say this was the second officer-involved shooting in North Philadelphia in just three days.
