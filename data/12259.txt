CRAWFORD COUNTY — Crawford County Prosecutor Everette Ayers said Deputy Michael Jacobi acted in self-defense when he shot and killed Eric Lee Ramsey, the suspect in a January string of crimes in Mount Pleasant, Gaylord and Frederic that included kidnapping, rape, arson, attempted murder and assault on a police officer.

Ayers released his findings in a press release June 18. The seven-page document details the events of Jan. 16-17, 2013, that began with the kidnapping and sexual assault of a female Central Michigan University student and led to Ramsey allegedly crashing a stolen flatbed truck into three police cruisers in Gaylord and Frederic, including one driven by Jacobi. (See related synopsis of that night’s events.)

According to the document, Jacobi exited his damaged patrol car on the shoulder of Old 27 with his service rifle which was jammed. Jacobi was at the rear of his cruiser as Ramsey was standing near the front right side with an object in his hand, which Jacobi believed was a gun.

Jacobi yelled for Ramsey to put his hands up, threw his malfunctioning rifle to the ground and drew his service pistol. Ramsey got back in his truck attempting to free the vehicle. As Jacobi approached the truck, Ramsey pointed an object at the deputy. Jacobi began firing his service pistol, striking Ramsey in the neck and head.

Ramsey died at the scene. Inside his truck officers found a ski mask and a realistic-looking air pistol.

“Because Deputy Jacobi used deadly force against Mr. Ramsey that resulted in his death, Deputy Jacobi, by definition, committed a homicide,” Ayers said in his legal analysis. “Not all homicides, however, are criminal.”

Ayers cited numerous examples of case law where homicides were justified in self-defense and in the defense of others, as well as Michigan law allowing the use of deadly force against a fleeing felon.

“Based upon a review of the facts and the law, it is clear that Mr. Ramsey presented an immediate danger of death or great bodily harm to Deputy Jacobi,” Ayers said in his conclusion. “As such, Deputy Jacobi acted properly in self-defense.

“Self-defense aside,” Ayers continued, “the evidence is overwhelming that Eric Ramsey was a fleeing felon who had committed multiple felonies ... As such, Deputy Jacobi was justified in shooting Ramsey as he was attempting to flee in his truck.”

Ayers’ report also included a personal note commending members of the Crawford County Sheriff’s Department for their actions during the “unprecedented tragedy.”

“I am convinced that but for the extraordinary efforts of the Crawford County Sheriff’s Office, the Michigan State Police and the Grayling City Police Department, additional lives could have been lost,” read Ayers’ note. “Their courage and professionalism are a tribute to your leadership and the leadership of other departments and a credit to this community.”

Synopsis of Ramsey crime spree:

The following is a bulleted synopsis of the events alleged to have occurred on the night of Jan. 16-17, 2013, involving Eric Lee Ramsey, the suspect in a rash of crimes including kidnapping, sexual assault, carjacking, arson, attempted murder, fleeing and assaulting/obstructing a police officer. It is compiled from Herald Times archives and information released this week by Crawford County Prosecutor Everett Ayers.

• At approximately 9:30 p.m. Jan. 16, Eric Lee Ramsey, 30, Mount Pleasant, abducted a young woman at gunpoint in the parking lot of Central Michigan University’s Student Activity Center and forced her into her blue 2003 Ford Escape. He drove her to a home in Isabella County where he sexually assaulted her. It is believed Ramsey targeted his victim randomly.

• Ramsey taped her arms to her side and taped her mouth shut, then forced her back into the vehicle with two gas cans. He reportedly showed her a lighter and told her it had gone through a washing machine twice. He stated, “We will see if Jesus loves you. If it lights you die. If it doesn’t you live.” Ramsey struck the lighter and it lit. He then drove off with the victim.

• Upon seeing a porch light, the victim opened her car door and rolled out as the vehicle traveled 45 mph, suffering a broken arm. She ran to a house on Mission Road and began yelling and knocking on the door. Fourteen-year-old James Persyn was home with his two younger siblings. Persyn let her in and locked the door, then armed himself with a hunting knife and ushered everyone to a bathroom. He also called 9-1-1.

• Ramsey tried unsuccessfully to enter the home then dumped gasoline on the house and set it on fire. He fled in the victim’s Escape. Persyn’s father came home and found the residence on fire. The fire was extinguished and no one was hurt.

• At 2:50 a.m. Michigan State Police (MSP) Sgt. Brett Gooding observed the suspicious Escape at the intersection of South Otsego Avenue and Commerce Boulevard in Gaylord. Ramsey shut off his vehicle’s lights and turned into the parking lot of Kneaded Relief. Gooding was parked and about to call dispatch when Ramsey rammed Gooding’s Tahoe multiple times, disabling the cruiser and injuring Gooding.

• MSP Sgt. John Janicki and Trooper Rick Carlson followed vehicle tracks where it crashed through a gate at the elk viewing area. The Escape was found abandoned in the field and troopers followed footprints to Arrow Sanitation on Little League Drive where Ramsey allegedly stole a 2011 F-550 flatbed truck. A call was put out for officers to be on the lookout for the truck.

• Crawford County Deputy Michael Jacobi was driving north toward Waters when he passed Ramsey, speeding south in snowy conditions. Jacobi pursued Ramsey, who had no lights on.

• At 4:17 a.m. a southbound MSP cruiser, occupied by troopers James Leonard and Kyle Kelly, was rear-ended by Ramsey and immobilized. Leonard and Kelly were injured and waved Jacobi to continue pursuit.

• Grayling City Police Officer Grossberg radioed that he was going to deploy stop sticks. Ramsey turned the truck around near May Lake Road and headed north on Old 27 toward Jacobi, who swerved off the west side of the road to avoid a collision.

• Ramsey crashed head-on into Jacobi’s cruiser and repeatedly backed up and rammed the patrol car.

• As his vehicle was being rammed, Jacobi grabbed his M16 service rifle, set it to fully automatic and fired a short burst as he held the gun over his head. The gun jammed and as Jacobi tried to clear the jam, Ramsey was leaning over and looking at Jacobi from the cab. The truck and cruiser were stuck together.

• Jacobi, injured, got out of his cruiser and continued to try clearing the rifle which had stovepiped (jammed with a cartridge wedged in the receiver). Ramsey was outside of the truck and standing at the front right side of the patrol car with an object in his hand, which Jacobi believed was a gun.

• Jacobi ordered Ramsey to put his hands up, threw his M16 on the ground and drew his Glock .40-caliber pistol. Deputy Swope and Officer Grossberg arrived on scene and Jacobi yelled for Swope to provide cover.

• Ramsey got back in the truck and tried to free it from the damaged cruiser. As Jacobi approached the truck, Ramsey pointed an object at the deputy. Jacobi began firing his Glock as he approached the truck, striking Ramsey in the head and neck.

• Grossberg and Swope approached the truck, pulled Ramsey from the vehicle and handcuffed him. Officers checked for vital signs and found Ramsey to be dead.

• Officers found a ski mask and a realistic-looking air pistol inside the truck.

• An autopsy performed on Jan. 18 at Sparrow Hospital in Lansing determined the cause of death to be gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
