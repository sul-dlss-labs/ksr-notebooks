The young driver who killed his two teenage male passengers in a car crash in Far Rockaway yesterday has been arrested, police said.

Cyirell Lomax, 19, was charged with two counts of reckless endangerment, unauthorized use of someone else’s car and aggravated unlicensed operation in the one-car smashup that killed his 14-year-old passenger and 15-year-old passenger, police said.

Lomax was driving a green 2009 Toyota Corolla that belonged to an acquaintance or friend’s grandmother when he lost control of the vehicle and smashed into a cement pillar that supports an elevated train line around 3 a.m., Saturday, sources said.

Police are withholding the names of the teens killed in the crash because they are still trying to notify family members.

In addition to the criminal charges, Lomax was ticketed for insufficient tail-lights.
