SAN JACINTO — Deputies called to a San Jacinto home used a stun gun on a distraught man who refused to drop a knife he used to slash himself in the neck, and who later died at a hospital, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department reported Tuesday.

A 911 call came in around 6:45 p.m. Thursday reporting an attempted suicide at a home located on Angela Way near Wateka Street, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

Deputies arrived at the home and were taken by a resident to a family member in the backyard with a self-inflicted knife wound, later identified as 28-year-old Jose Andres Lopez, sheriff’s Sgt. Wallace Clear said.

The man was “bleeding profusely from the neck” and was still holding the knife, the sergeant said.

“Lopez refused to drop the knife after several commands to do so,” Clear said. “A Taser deployment caused Lopez to release the knife and he was handcuffed as deputies performed life-saving measures until paramedics arrived.”

Because of the use of force by deputies, sheriff’s homicide detectives will investigate the man’s death, which is protocol in such cases. The official cause of death will be determined by the coroner’s office, Clear said.
