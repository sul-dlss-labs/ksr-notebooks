Sheriff Leroy Moody believes Gonzales may have died in a case of 'suicide by cop' after recently receiving some bad news.

He said Gonzales had no previous dealings with the sheriff's office and no criminal history.

Moody said Gonzalez smashed into the building with two magazines of ammunition in his pick-up truck.

He told Kristv.com: 'He jumps out, fires several rounds, shoots some windows out. Luckily nobody was injured.'

Gonzalez then pointed the gun at a deputy who returned fire, hitting him once in the chest and once in the head.

He died at Spohn Memorial hospital hours later.

Justice of the Peace Yolanda Guerrero, whose office was hit by the car, said: 'In my 12 years that I have been judge, I have always feared that something like this would happen, and this morning, it came true.'

Moody says no one in the sheriff's building was injured.
