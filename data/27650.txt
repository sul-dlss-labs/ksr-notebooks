KEITHVILLE, La. (AP) — Louisiana authorities have identified a man who was shot and killed by a sheriff’s deputy while brandishing what was believed to be a gun, a parish sheriff confirmed.

Authorities later said it was determined that the man was carrying something resembling a gun, which included a pipe and a wooden handle covered in black tape

Caddo Parish deputies were dispatched Monday afternoon to a neighborhood in Keithville, about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Shreveport, after a caller reported someone was waving a weapon around, Sheriff Steve Prator said.

The suspect was identified Tuesday as Cody Hodges, 34, the Caddo Parish Coroner said in a statement obtained by news outlets.

Prator told news outlets that a deputy fired 11 shots at Hodges after he repeatedly refused orders to drop his weapon, then pointed it at the deputy. A second deputy on the scene attempted life-saving measures, but Hodges died, news outlets reported.

The sheriff didn’t identify the deputy or say whether the shooting would be subject to an internal investigation.

Prator said the object brandished by the suspect was apparently “part of a firearm” but “not operable.” He told news outlets it may have been pieced together with parts from other guns.

“The cylinder is black taped underneath a pipe and it has a wooden handle on it that is also black taped,” Prator told KSLA-TV. “So all this time we are thinking it is an actual firearm.”

Text messages obtained by the sheriff’s office reportedly revealed Hodges had texted a contact before the confrontation, saying “someone is going to die tonight,” Prator told KTBS-TV.
