A bicyclist died after colliding with a San Bernardino police patrol car on Thursday, March 19, the Police Department said.

A caller notified authorities of the crash on Baseline Street east of Valencia Avenue at about 4: 55 p.m.

The bicyclist, a 61-year-old San Bernardino resident, was riding west on Baseline in rainy conditions when he made a left turn in front of traffic and was hit by the patrol car, a news release said. He was pronounced dead 11 minutes later at the scene of the crash, and later identified as Jose Rincon.

Neither alcohol or speed appeared to have played a role in the collision, the release said. Sgt. John Echevarria said the officer was driving from one location to another while in the middle of a call and was driving at a normal speed.

Police ask anyone with information on the collision to call Detective Dan Acosta or Sgt. Jeff Harvey at 909-384-5792.
