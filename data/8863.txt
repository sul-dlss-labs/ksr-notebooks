CHICO — A Chico man’s apparent gunshot suicide this morning prompted a major police response which led to the evacuation of several apartments and the closure of a section of California Park Drive for more than three hours.

Police arrived at the victim’s apartment, in the 2500 block of California Park, at 8:38 a.m.

The body of the victim was found by Special Weapons and Tactics officers just after 2 p.m.

The victim had reportedly e-mailed his last will and testament to a relative Sunday night, and officers were checking on his welfare Monday morning at the request of that relative.

The officers heard the shot seconds after knocking on the door of the victim, a 53-year-old man who has lived at the Lakeview Apartments for about three years. He has been identified by police, but notification of family members remains an issue.

When the resident didn’t respond to phone calls and announcements police made over a bullhorn this morning, officers set a perimeter around the apartment building and began evacuating immediate neighbors. An office building at 2577 California Park Drive, which houses a foster care agency, was closed most of the day.

When a Special Weapons and Tactics Team arrived at about 11 a.m., police shut California Park between Bruce Road and the east end of the apartment complex.

SWAT team entered the lower floor apartment through a window and began carefully searching the apartment. The victim was found lying on the floor, deceased.

The man reportedly had a .44-caliber Magnum revolver registered to him.
