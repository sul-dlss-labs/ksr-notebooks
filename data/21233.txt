BURTON, Michigan -- Burton authorities are conducting an internal investigation into the shooting of a Flint man by a Burton police officer.

The state police district headquarters in Saginaw is investigating the incident.

Police said Harvey L. Steward, 46, was shot about noon Saturday near Center and Lippincott roads. Police were called to the area on reports that Steward was walking in traffic and yelling that someone was trying to kill him.According to Burton Police Chief John Benthall, a struggle occurred after a Burton officer arrived and Steward was shot.

Benthall declined to release further information about the shooting because of the ongoing investigation.

The officer involved, whose name has not been released, has been put on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. State police findings will be sent to the Genesee County prosecutor's office to determine if charges will be filed against the officer.

Store owners in the area said Steward was acting "abnormally" and appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Witness D'Andra Johnson, who lives across the street from where the shooting took place, said she did not think the officer should have shot Steward.

She said the officer was on top of Steward, trying to calm him down.
