OKMULGEE COUNTY, Okla. – The man who died during a deputy-involved shooting this week has been identified.

The Okmulgee County Sheriff’s Office say John Henry Neuman, 53, would not exit his vehicle after it crashed near Deep Fork Wildlife pond Wednesday.

When Neuman eventually did exit the car he was armed and began shooting at those in the area, according to OSBI.

The deputy fired back and ultimately hit Neuman who then fell into the pond. Emergency crews attempted to pull Neuman from the water but he began shooting again, prompting the deputy to fire his gun again.

Emergency crews were then able to extract Neuman from the water and attempted to revive him but he died at the scene.

OSBI was called in to investigate and discovered that Neuman was out of jail with an ankle monitor for the murder of his wife in 2015 in Sequoyah County.
