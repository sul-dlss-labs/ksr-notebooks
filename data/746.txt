A man who was shot to death by police in a shopping center parking lot last week has been identified as a 29-year-old Sun Valley resident, authorities said Monday.

Kinh Quoc Dao was killed after he reportedly pretended to reach for a gun during a traffic stop Friday at Victory Plaza in the 13000 block of Victory Boulevard.

When an officer first approached the car, Dao told him he had a gun and would shoot him, according to a Los Angeles Police Department written statement. The officer then called for backup.

After more officers arrived, Dao got out of his car and continued to threaten them before he reached into his clothing and simulated pointing a gun at the officers, police said. Three officers shot at Dao, hitting him several times. He died at a local hospital.

None of the officers was injured, and police found no weapon on Dao.

Police said the officers who fired their weapons were Mark Guardado, 27, of the Valley Traffic Division, a six-year department veteran; Wesley Albin, 35, of the Metro Division, a 10-year veteran; and Jon-Christian Healy, 30, of the North Hollywood Division, a five-year veteran.

Dao’s family declined to comment Monday on the shooting.

The LAPD’s Robbery-Homicide Division is conducting an investigation, as it does in all officer-involved shootings, police said.
