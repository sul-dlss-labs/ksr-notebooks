A standoff in Conecuh County turned deadly Wednesday night after an armed man refused to give up, according to Alabama State Troopers.

State law enforcement was called out to assist Conecuh County Sheriff Randy Brock's office following an assault earlier Wednesday evening in Monroeville.

The male suspect in the assault barricaded himself in a house off Highway 31 between Evergreen and Castleberry.

He has been identified as of Oct. 20 as Leslie Portis Jr., 57, of Evergreen.

Police were unable to persuade Portis to surrender and leave the household he had taken shelter in.

Trooper spokesman corporal Jess Thornton said law enforcement gave the man "multiple" opportunities to surrender and believed the man was armed.

Their fears were confirmed when Portis came out shooting at officers.

Thornton said that multiple officers then fired at the suspect resulting in his death.

Secretary of Law Enforcement Spencer Collier, Col. John Richardson and State Bureau of Investigation Director Gene Wiggins responded to the scene.

"SBI will thoroughly investigate both the officer involved shooting and the assault in Monroeville," Collier said in a statement. "I am very relieved that no officers were injured this evening."

SBI will conduct the investigation of the officer involved shooting and the assault that occurred in Monroeville.
