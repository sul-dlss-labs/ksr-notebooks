Suspect Identified After He Died In A Chase With Valley Brook Police

Police identified a man who led officers on a pursuit through southeast Oklahoma City over the weekend.

The chase eventually ended in a crash which killed the suspect, as well as a passenger in another vehicle.

Officers said they noticed the suspect vehicle around 2:30 a.m. Saturday, but as they tried to pull him over, he fled.

“The pursuit continued westbound on SE 59th Street,” said Chief Michael Stamp with Valley Brook Police. “(He) ran a couple red light at I-35 and continued west towards Shields Boulevard.”

The chase lasted less than a minute, and when the suspect crossed Shields, he hit two other vehicles.

“We still don’t know the exact reasons why he was running,” Stamp said. “I know one of the officers thought he was driving while he was impaired. I know he didn’t have a driver's license.”

Police identified the driver as Derrick Dewayne Alexander. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said others were injured as well and a passenger in one of the other vehicles was taken to a local hospital in critical condition where they later died. That person's name has not been released.

“High speed chases are very dangerous and it can cause senseless fatalities,” Stamp said. “Just like in this case right here.”
