A suicidal man died in a police-involved shooting during a SWAT team standoff in Coral Springs Wednesday, the Broward County Sheriff's Office said.

BSO has launched an investigation into the incident that occurred around 1 p.m. at 11293 Northwest 11th Court in Coral Springs.

Officers responded to the home of 71-year-old Robert Page after receiving notification that he was threatening suicide and had weapons in the home, officials said.

Coral Springs Police negotiators tried to get Page to exit the home but when he did he was armed with a shotgun and refused officers' commands, officials said.

Two officers opened fire. BSO said Page was pronounced dead at the scene. No one else was reported injured.

The officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.
