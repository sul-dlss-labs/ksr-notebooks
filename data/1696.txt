A New York State Police trooper fatally shot a man who charged at officers as they stormed his bedroom during a drug raid early yesterday on the East End of Long Island, the police said.

The man was identified as John Rasanen, 28. The police said he died minutes after being shot once in the chest at point-blank range at 12 Overlook Drive, Aquebogue, where he was a tenant.

Maj. Walter Heesch, commander of the state police on Long Island, said Mr. Rasanen was the primary suspect sought in raids of four sites by a task force of state, county and local police officers. Mr. Rasanen had been under investigation for six months and was suspected of being a mid-level cocaine and marijuana dealer, the police said.

Around 6 a.m., about 20 officers converged on the Aquebogue home, a secluded raised ranch reached by dirt roads. A team of state troopers with special protective gear burst into the house, and four officers charged downstairs, where Mr. Rasanen was in bed, the police said.
