The driver of a vehicle that crashed during a police chase over the weekend in Murfreesboro has been charged in the death of his passenger.

Murfreesboro police responded around 1:30 a.m. Sunday to a call of a domestic situation in a moving vehicle.

The caller, a passenger, told a dispatcher that she had been assaulted and Joshua Williams, the 39-year-old driver, refused to stop the vehicle, investigators said.

An officer spotted the vehicle near South Rutherford Boulevard and at some point, Williams’ vehicle went off the road and behind a house near a dead end on Woodbury Pike.

As the officer stopped and walked toward the back of the home, Williams drove back onto the road and went inbound on Woodbury Pike.

According to a crash report from Tennessee Highway Patrol, Williams drove straight through a left hand curve in the road and hit a power pole head-on off Ringwald Road, causing the vehicle to rotate and hit a second pole on the front passenger-side door.

Troopers said Rachel Bonds, a 40-year-old passenger, was found dead at the scene and Williams was gone.

Around 10 a.m. Sunday, a resident reported that Williams was at a home on Old Woodbury Highway.

Deputies with the Rutherford County Sheriff’s Office responded to the home where they located Williams and took him into custody.

He was booked into the Rutherford County jail on charges of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and leaving the scene of a fatal crash.

Williams was held without bond and is expected in court April 26.
