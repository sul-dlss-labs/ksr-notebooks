SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - A memorial account has been set up for the family of a woman killed by her estranged husband on October 24 during a chase involving Shreveport Police.

It began as a domestic dispute in north Shreveport, according to the Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office.

The initial call at 8:28 a.m. reported a man was threatening a woman with a shotgun and had pulled her inside a vehicle. When Shreveport police arrived, the suspect led officers on a high-speed chase. As it ended, he shot at officers and struck a police car and officers returned fire.

He was shot and killed by police as he fired shots at the officers while exiting the car.

The Caddo Parish Sheriff's Office later identified the man as Donnie Ray Plater, 42.

During the chase, police reported shots coming from the car, and the woman was found dead inside the car. The sheriff's office identified her as Cindy Johnson West, 34, of Shreveport.

West leaves behind two children. Donations may be made at any Barksdale Federal Credit Union under the Cindy Johnson West Angels account.
