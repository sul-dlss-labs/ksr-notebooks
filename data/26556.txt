MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) â€” Court records say a man who was killed in Missoula on Sept. 2 had refused efforts by police officers to take away his gun.

Records indicate 35-year-old Steven Cole Gill was shot inside a recreational vehicle by officers responding to a report of drug activity. Investigators found a revolver in the toilet, "barrel up."

Officers Chris Proper and Eric Weber said they responded to the motor home shortly before 5 p.m.

Both said Gill was holding a gun, which they tried to remove by force. They were unsuccessful and both shot Gill. The officers are on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.

The Missoulian reports Gill had been under investigation for drug possession earlier this year and had a previous conviction for assaulting an officer.
