CLEVELAND â€” The driver of the vehicle involved in a fatal crash after fleeing from troopers early Friday morning has been identified.

At first, troopers asked for the public's help in identifying the driver after he refused to reveal his identity to authorities at the hospital. While using a fingerprint technology system, with the assistance from the Rocky River Police Department, the driver was identified as Richard Darnell Aarons, 38, of Cleveland.

Shortly before 1:51 a.m., troopers attempted a traffic stop of a car on the Innerbelt Bridge near the West 14th exit when the driver took off.

When the vehicle went under I-71, a 9 mm handgun was thrown from the driver's side of the vehicle.

Aarons allegedly exited at Denison/Harvard Avenue at a high-rate of speed, according to troopers. The car struck a guardrail and a utility pole. Both the driver and passenger were injured and remained in the car until officers were able to assist them.

The passenger, a 62-year-old man identified as Marvin Caesar Thornton, was pronounced dead at the scene.

At the scene, Aarons claimed there was another gun in the car. Troopers said no other guns were found in the vehicle, but the gun that was thrown from the car was recovered..

He was transported to MetroHealth Medical Center with serious, but non-life threatening injuries.

Troopers say the crash remains under investigation and charges relating to the crash are pending.
