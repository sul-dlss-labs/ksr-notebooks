A Chicago woman died after her vehicle was struck by an SUV driven by officers chasing suspects in a south side home invasion, police said.

The two officers were hurt, but not seriously, in the crash in the 2400 block of East 76th Street. The female driver in the other car, 54-year-old Jacqueline Reynolds, was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, police spokesman John Mirabelli said.

Family members said Reynolds, who lived on the 7800 block of South Phillips Avenue, was heading to work at the time of the 10:15 a.m. crash.



"To see somebody one day and not see them the next, it's always hard on you," said family friend Paris Woods.

The officers were in pursuit of two or three people suspected in a home invasion at East 78th Street and South Ellis Avenue when their SUV collided with Reynolds’ Pontiac. Witnesses to the crash said the officers' vehicle struck Reynolds. Police officials said the opposite.



"Much too fast. They were at least going 80 or 90 (miles per hour), said witness Virgil Jakes.



A third vehicle, a tan and gray Chevy, was struck by Reynold’s after she collided with the SUV. The male passenger of the vehicle was in stable condition, while the female driver fled from the scene.



Officers said they tracked down the home invasion suspects' car at East 74th Street and South Phillips Avenue. It was just parked on the street but officers canvassed the neighborhood and took the suspects into custody.



The police department's Major Accident Investigation Unit was investigating the crash.
