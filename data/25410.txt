(KTVE) Louisiana State police are investigating an officer involved shooting which left the assailant dead. It happened in the early morning hours Saturday.



It started with a 911 call at a home on the 1200 block of South 9th Street in Monroe around 12:30 a.m., where police ordered a suspect to leave the home and not come back.



But two hours later, another call came from the same home.



Police say a man was stabbed while trying to intervene in an aggravated assault on a woman by 25-year old Detandel Devon Pickens of Monroe.



Officials say police arrived at the scene to find Pickens holding two knives to a woman’s neck.



Police say they ordered him to drop the knives, then used a Taser to try and subdue him — but that did not stop Pickens.



Officials say officers were forced to use lethal force to stop Pickens, who sustained fatal injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene by the Ouachita Parish Coroner’s Office.



No officers were harmed in the incident. One officer, who fired the shots, is on administrative leave. The other officers involved are being given time off.



Names of the victims have not been released yet.



The investigation is ongoing by the Louisiana State Police and the Monroe Police Department.



Upon completion of a thorough and objective investigation, the Louisiana State Police investigative report will be turned over to the District Attorney’s Office.
