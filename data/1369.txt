A 56-year-old Corona man died Tuesday from injuries his family says were inflicted by police in a scuffle last week.

Abdullah Fakhry was shouting at his wife during an argument in the family’s apartment Dec. 9 when two Corona police officers arrived, said the man’s son Fawad.

Police said the two officers went to the apartment at 6:30 p.m. and became involved in a “physical altercation” with members of the family. Two calls for backup brought 10 more officers to the scene.

The younger Fakhry said he saw two officers sitting on his father--one on his head, the other on his back.

“My dad wasn’t moving,” the son said. “I said, ‘Please, let him go.’ ”

Fawad Fakhry said his father was in poor health and had asthma. The son said he saw an officer strike his father’s head with a baton.

Corona Police Sgt. Michael Abel declined to discuss details of the incident because it is under investigation.

Abdullah Fakhry was taken to Corona Regional Medical Center, where his admitting diagnosis was cardiac arrest, said Teri Ransbury, a hospital representative.

Fakhry died at 1:42 a.m. Tuesday. An autopsy will be performed by the Riverside County coroner, Ransbury said.

Police spokesman Abel said two officers suffered minor arm and shoulder injuries in the incident.

Abel said that officers are still being interviewed and that the department will determine whether policy and training procedures were violated. None of the officers has been suspended, he said.

“Nothing at this time indicates any misconduct,” Abel added.

Three family members--Fawad Fakhry, 36; his brother Farhad Fakhry, 27; and their sister Farida Fakhry, 25--were cited for resisting police, Abel said.

The police will report their findings in January to the district attorney to determine whether charges should be filed, Abel said.
