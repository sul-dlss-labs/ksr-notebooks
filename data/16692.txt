SALT LAKE CITY - Police have identified the suspect shot and killed during a Salt Lake City burglary as 48-year-old Robert Richard Berger.

Officers shot Berger after they said he broke into two homes and stabbed a woman early Wednesday morning.

Police said they were called to a home just after midnight near 838 S. Roberta St. when parents found a man had broken into their 2-year-old child's room.

The family was able to force out the man and immediately called 911.

Police arrived and were questioning the parents when they were called about a man trying to break into a home down the street.

When officers got to the second home, they found the suspect, Berger, stabbing a woman inside.

An officer confronted the suspect, Berger, and was forced to shoot and kill him.

Authorities have not confirmed the woman's condition.

Police have not said if they believe the suspect was targeting these homes or if it was a random crime spree.

Officers said Berger had a criminal history dating back to 1986 and most recently was arrested for aggravated robbery and attempted theft.

He was just paroled Sept. 15 and was currently considered a fugitive with an active warrant.

Unified Police will now take over the investigation and the officer will be placed on routine administrative leave.
