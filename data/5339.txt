Marvin Harrell, the suspect in a kidnapping & double homicide

The search is over for one of the suspects in a cold-blooded crime here in Baton Rouge. Street Beat Reporter Greg Meriwether has been tracking this story most of the afternoon and evening and has a late development.

Police had been searching for a man accused of killing his girlfriend's parents. As Centreville, MS Police and the Angola search dogs closed in they heard a shot.

Centreville Police tell WAFB 9 News the suspect -- 45-year-old Marvin Harrell -- killed himself just before 10:00 p.m. in a field. Police investigators believe Harrell had help, although Baton Rouge Police are not ready to release any info on his accomplice.

A 46-year-old woman lived at 4555 Charles Street in Baton Rouge with her parents, and had just broken it off with a guy. Police tell us at 4:30 Friday morning that guy -- Marvin Harrell -- made his way inside the house and killed the parents: 63-year-old Roosevelt Clarke and his 67-year-old wife, Sophia.

The gunman shot them in their beds at the back of the house.

Investigators tell WAFB 9 News after killing her parents, Harrell then kidnapped his ex-girlfriend, taking her to Centreville, Mississippi. Centreville Police report Harrell eventually let his ex-girlfriend, Slyvia Thompson go.

She made her way to a store in Centreville and flagged down police to tell them her story.

"She's still pretty upset," Centreville Police Chief Jimmy Ray Reese said. "Ever since we got to the office this afternoon."
