Lackawanna County District Attorney Mark Powell summed it up this way: "It was an unjustified killing, he was a bad cop, he made a bad decision."

As quoted by WNEP-TV, Powell was talking about the case of former Carbondale, Pa., police officer Frank Schulze, who was initially charged with homicide in the off-duty fatal shooting of Joseph Molinaro back in February of 2016.

The case seemed headed for trial in Scranton until a plea deal was reached Thursday.

Schulze, 28, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter, which means a killer believes he has the law on his side when the killing happens but that belief is misplaced, WNEP reported, adding:

Schulze was off-duty when he pursued Joseph Molinaro after an argument. With his police weapon drawn, Schulze eventually shot and killed Molinaro.

The Molinaro family approved the plea deal.

Schulze is sentenced is 30 to 60 months in jail, where he has been since March 2016 when he was first charged in the case.

He's already served almost all of that minimum sentence. But the judge ordered that Schulze must serve at least one more year behind bars, banning him from seeking parole until another year has passed.

As the Times-Tribune writes, Schulze had maintained he acted in self-defense in the shooting. However, Molinaro was unarmed at the time and video surveillance footage depicted Molinaro retreating from Schulze, who had his gun drawn.

One thing is for sure, Schulze will never serve as a police officer ever again.
