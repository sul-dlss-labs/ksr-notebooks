A North Platte man died Sunday afternoon after a foot pursuit with police.

Just after 1:30 p.m., dispatch received a report that a man who was wanted on felony warrants was crossing the Buffalo Bill viaduct, the Lincoln County Sheriff's Office released in a statement.

When North Platte Police Officers arrived to the area, a man was walking over the viaduct headed south, according to the release. He was identified as Robert Mills, 37.

Officers attempted to contact Mills, "but he ran south down the viaduct, into [a] local neighborhood," officials said in the release. As officers pursued Mills on foot, they noticed he had a handgun.

Mills ran into the alley between West Sixth and Front streets, just east of the viaduct, according to the release. Officers reported that "Mills shot himself in the alley," according to the release. North Platte Rescue was dispatched, but Mills died of his injuries, according to the release.

Because Mills was in the middle of a pursuit when he died, Nebraska law mandates a Grand Jury investigation, according to the release. It added that the Lincoln County Attorney's Office appointed the Sheriff's Office to conduct the investigation. According to the release, the investigation is ongoing.
