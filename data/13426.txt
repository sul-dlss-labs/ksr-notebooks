A man was shot and killed last week when a Tulare County Sheriff’s deputy returned fire while pursuing the man in Ivanhoe.

According to Sheriff’s officials, the deputy attempted to make contact with a wanted felon for attempted homicide at 7:19 p.m. on Sept. 20. When the suspect saw the deputy, he threw a can at the deputy and began to run. The deputy chased the suspect on foot for about 75 yards until the man turned to confront the officer at the corner of Heather and Hawthorn in Ivanhoe. The suspect pulled out a handgun and fired a shot at the Deputy. The deputy returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. The detective was not injured and there were other injuries reported.

An autopsy was performed on Sept. 23 revealed that Fuentes succumbed to his injury from exsanguination, due to a single gunshot wound. After his next of kin was contacted, the Sheriff’s Department identified the man as Carlos Fuentes, 20, of Cutler. The Visalia Police Department is conducting the Officer Involved Shooting investigation and the deputy was placed on paid administrative leave, standard protocol in any officer involved shooting.
