Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 7100 Renwick July 27, 2009 - An armed suspect was fatally shot when he attempted to stab an on-duty Houston police officer and his K-9 dog at 7100 Renwick #713 about 4:30 p.m. on Friday (July 24). The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. His identity is pending notification to family members by the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office. Officer W.G. Smith, who discharged his duty weapon, is assigned to the Tactical Operations Division and was sworn in as an officer in June 1998. Officer Smith was not injured in this incident. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant C.M. Cegielski and Senior Police Officer E. Schmidt reported: Officers responded to a burglary in progress call at 7100 Renwick #713 when one of the residents came home, heard his television on, noticed his front window was broken, and saw movement inside his apartment. As officers arrived a male suspect came out of the broken front window. Officers ordered the suspect to get on the ground in English and Spanish, which the suspect ignored. An HPD K-9 dog was sent into the enclosed patio area to engage the suspect and assist officers with arresting him. The suspect then produced a screw driver, attempted to stab the K-9 and was able to get control of the K-9. Officer Smith then entered the enclosed area and the suspect stabbed the officer with a screwdriver. Officer Smith, fearing for his life, discharged his weapon at least once, and struck the suspect in the chest.

As is customary in officer-involved shootings in the city limits, this case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office. JKS/VHS
