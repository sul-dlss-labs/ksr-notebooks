A large police presence -- including the Georgia State Patrol and Atlanta police -- could be seen as NewsChopper 2 flew over the scene.

According to the GBI, Atlanta police located a stolen vehicle just after 2 p.m. Officers requested the help of GSP and a chase ensued.

"While attempting to evade the trooper, the driver ran into an APD patrol vehicle," GBI spokesperson Nelly Miles said. "We can say for sure that after the collision and during that point is when the trooper discharged his weapon."

Witnesses were stunned by what happened.

"I heard a gunshot, 'Pow! Pow! Pow!' And I went back inside," said witness Ginny Rosser.

This was the second officer-involved shooting to happen in metro Atlanta Friday.

A Locust Grove Police officer and two Henry County deputies were injured when they were shot by a suspect in Locust Grove. The GBI is handling that case as well.
