Jayess man kills self after shooting girlfriend Published 10:36 pm Friday, July 27, 2018

A Jayess woman remains in intensive care at a Jackson hospital after her boyfriend shot her then killed himself in front of deputies, authorities said.

John Clifton Hill, 50, of 98 Trace Road, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound shortly before noon Friday, Lawrence County Sheriff Lessie Butler said.

Butler said Hill and the victim lived together on Trace Road with the woman’s daughter, who is between 13 and 16 years old.

The girl witnessed the shooting and appears to have been kidnapped by Hill. However, he let her out of the vehicle a short distance from the house and she called 911, Butler said.

The sheriff said records show that deputies had not responded to the address previously on a domestic call, but they had spoken to Hill on several occasions concerning an ongoing feud he had with a neighbor over land.

Butler said it appears the victim was shot on the couch in the living room of the home about 9:30 a.m. The weapon was a .380 pistol, he said.

As deputies searched the county for Hill’s vehicle, they received a tip that he was at a mobile home at 209 Lambert Road, just three miles away from the scene of the shooting.

When deputies arrived, Hill was sitting on the porch with two other people.

“When they surrounded him, when my deputies asked them to put their hands up, the other two put their hands up, he went to raise his with the gun in one hand and pulled the trigger as it was going up by his head,” he said.

Butler did not expect charges to be filed against the two people found with Hill.

Investigators plan to interview the victim’s daughter to determine the cause of the shooting, he said.
