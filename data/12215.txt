The Joint Criminal Apprehension Team, a mix of federal agents and local police who chase fugitives and are known by the acronym JCAT, started searching for the suspected bandits as their robberies increased. On Jan. 9, the team, which was under the command of Deputy U.S. Marshal Jim Phelps, located a Mazda pickup truck in the area of 1000 South and 900 East that they believed belonged to Simons. The plan was to wait until Simons left the area in her pickup and pull her over. The district attorney's report notes that Sutera had reservations about the plan.
