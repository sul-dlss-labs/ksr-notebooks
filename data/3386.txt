Since 2002, five people have died in collisions following police chases in Ventura County:

- April 3, 2005: Stephen Aguirre, 39, of Camarillo, was on his way to play golf when his car was struck at a Camarillo intersection by a motorist allegedly running from a Ventura County sheriff's deputy.

- May 19, 2004: Michael Koslosky, 38, of Oxnard, crashed his motorcycle into the back of a minivan on Ventura Road in Port Hueneme. He allegedly fled a Port Hueneme police officer who followed with his squad car's lights flashing. Police don't consider it a pursuit because the officer was a quarter-mile back or farther. A coroner's report said Koslosky had a blood-alcohol level of about 0.21 percent.

- Jan. 10, 2004: Rafael Nova, 26, of Simi Valley, allegedly fled a sobriety checkpoint in Simi Valley. Police chased him but said the pursuit was called off before Nova's vehicle crashed into two cars parked in a driveway. His blood-alcohol level was 0.15, nearly twice the allowable legal limit, according to a coroner's report.

- Oct. 10, 2002: James Vargas, 34, of Simi Valley, was being followed on his motorcycle by a Simi Valley police officer when he tried to pass a truck that was making a left-hand turn. His blood-alcohol level was 0.10.

- March 23, 2002: Jessica Morhoko, 18, of Oxnard, was going to a Denny's restaurant with her boyfriend when a CHP cruiser struck their vehicle in Oxnard as officers followed a motorist suspected of running a red light. CHP officials said officers were catching up to the suspect and were not yet engaged in a pursuit.
