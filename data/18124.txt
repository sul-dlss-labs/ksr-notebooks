Phoenix police have identified the 25-year-old man fatally shot by police after he pointed what turned out to be a BB gun at officers a west Phoenix apartment complex early Saturday.

Angel Torres Jr. was shot and killed after police came to his ex-girlfriend's apartment in the area of 57th Avenue and Thomas Road, said Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman. She texted a family member saying she believed Torres was on drugs and armed when he was retrieving property he had left there days prior.

The firearm police recovered from Torres was a black replica BB handgun, Lewis said.

The family member called police, and at about 3 a.m., officers arrived at the apartment and were speaking to the woman at the front door when the Torres appeared in a hallway and pointed the gun at police, Lewis said.

A lieutenant who has been with Phoenix police for more than 21 years fired at Torres, Lewis said.

He was pronounced dead at the scene; no officers were injured.

Though few details are available in the ongoing investigation, Lewis said the 25-year-old had an extensive criminal history.

The man's ex-girlfriend reported that there was a history of domestic violence, including threats toward her and her children, he said.
