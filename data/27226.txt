A man was killed in a vehicle crash Tuesday after beating a woman at a Calumet Heights gas station, then trying to flee police on the South Side, police say.

A 40-year-old man was allegedly seen beating a woman at a gas station about 1:55 a.m. in the 9100 block of South Stony Island Avenue, Chicago police said.

When officers responded, they saw the man driving away in a 2010 Dodge Charger with a woman who was screaming and waving for help as she tried to jump out of the moving vehicle, police said.

Officers quickly lost sight of the vehicle, but soon after found it crashed into three parked vehicles in the 2300 block of East 91st Street, police said.

The man, identified as Darryl L. Wright of Evergreen Park, was taken to the University of Chicago Medical Center and pronounced dead, the Cook County medical examiner’s office said.

An autopsy conducted Wednesday confirmed that Wright died of the injuries he sustained in the vehicle crash, the medical examiner’s office said. His death has been ruled an accident.

The woman, 28, was taken to the same hospital, police said. Her condition was stabilized.

The Chicago Police Department’s Major Accidents Unit is investigating.
