Authorities are calling a shooting at an apartment complex in Altamonte Springs “domestic in nature”. Police say they were called to 895 Wymore Road following reports of a shooting. "Neighbors said it's a quiet residence -- not a lot of issues there that they know of until last night when they heard some arguing. The gunshot they did hear,” Lt. Anthony Van Cleave said. When they arrived, they found a 40-year-old woman with a gunshot wound. The woman was taken to a hospital and is being treated for her injuries. Officials say a suspect into the shooting, 43-year-old Jason Giuliani, was found in the same complex and only a short distance away from the first scene.When authorities contacted Giuliani, they say he turned the gun and fired one round at himself."He called 911 himself. Upon calling 911 he advised what he had done, and when officers arrived on scene he called them over to where he was and that's when he did take his own life," Van Cleave said.Giuliani was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.Van Cleave says cases like these are always difficult as most people prepare to enjoy a holiday."I think it's time for us to reflect on the blessings we do have and the homes we work hard to create, and just cherish those precious moments we have with our families during the holidays and we'll all get through it together," Van Cleave said.
