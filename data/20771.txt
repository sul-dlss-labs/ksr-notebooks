Erie County DA Continues Investigation Into Officer Involved Shooting Posted: Monday, September 17, 2012 10:35 PM EST Updated: Monday, September 24, 2012 10:35 PM EST

Erie's District Attorney says the investigation is on-going, into that deadly officer-involved shooting last week in Erie.



Erie county detectives are sifting over all the evidence in case, before the DA Jack Daneri makes his own ruling.

The shooting happened around 10:00 last Wednesday night, at 8th and Parade in Erie.

A veteran Erie police officer shot and killed 53-year old James Burns.

Police say Burns ignored two officers' demands to drop his weapon, and instead pointed the gun at the officers.

An internal affairs investigation, within the police department, found that the officer was justified in using deadly force.

So, Daneri explains why his office is also conducting their own, separate investigation.

"If Erie Police does an investigation and they determine that pursuant to their policy of using deadly force, the officers' actions were appropriate, that's all well and good. But we also have a responsibility to say, 'okay, under the laws, the criminal laws of Pennsylvania, were the officer's actions justified under the criminal codes?' So that's what we are going to determine this week." Said Daneri.

As part of the investigation, county detectives are reviewing officer statements, as well as several eye witness accounts of what happened, "In fact, there were four eye witnesses to this event and so part of our investigation is to obviously look at each of these individuals interviews, see what they had to say about what they saw, and compare and contrast it with what the officer says with that, and that's routine." Said Daneri.



Police have not released the names of the two officers involved. They remain on paid administrative leave while the investigation continues.
