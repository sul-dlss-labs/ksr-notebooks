A sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a man who grabbed his partner’s gun late Friday, authorities said.

Linford Griffin, 25, of Los Angeles was pronounced dead about 5 a.m. Saturday.

Deputies had stopped Griffin about 9:45 p.m. as he was walking to question him about “suspicious activity in the area,” said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Sgt. Don Manumaleuna.

When a deputy patted down Griffin, a loaded gun fell from his waistband, he said. The suspect allegedly then grabbed the deputy’s holster.
