Buffalo, NY â€“ A Buffalo police officer shot and killed a robbery suspect late Friday afternoon.

According to police, an East Eagle Street man had robbed the Seneca Pharmacy at 1979 Seneca Street around 4pm. After fleeing with a quantity of pills, officers used a license plate number provided by witnesses to trace the suspect, identified as Matthew Connors, 23, and found him at his home. Connors began struggling with Officer James Reese, who was trying to arrest him. During the struggle, a single bullet was discharged from Reese's service revolver, striking Connors.

"The officer was in a fight for his life," Police Commissioner H. McCarthy Gipson told the Buffalo News.

Connors was pronounced dead at the scene.

Reese was treated at the Erie County Medical Center for injuries he suffered in the scuffle.

It was later determined that the weapon Connors used in his fight with Reese was a replice assault-type gun.

Reese was assigned to the South District. He is a highly decorated, 21-year veteran of the department.
