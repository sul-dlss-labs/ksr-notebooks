We now know the name of the man killed in the early morning hours of June 9th.

Justice of the Peace Donald Engleking confirmed for FOX44 News that Timothy Owen is the man killed during a gunfight with Temple police officers. Judge Engleking says he is still awaiting the autopsy report to release the official cause of death.

Texas Rangers are investigating the shooting that started with a disturbance call around 3:38am that Saturday morning from the Glen Apartments at 2602 South 39th Street.

The officers say when they got there, someone from the apartment shot at them, so they returned fire. They say they hit Owen, who died at the scene. The crossfire also hit a second person in the arm. He went to Baylor Scott & White Hospital for treatment. It is unknown at this time if that shot came from police or Owenâ€™s gun. No officers were injured.
