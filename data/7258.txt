CHICAGO Eighteen-year-old Luis Colon was shot and killed by police.

Police cordoned off the area where the shooting occurred at 5 p.m. in the 2700-block of North Kilbourn. Police were reportedly questioning several people in connection to the case.

A police source told ABC7 that officers approached a group of young people on the street and one man turned and walked away. When officers tried to stop him, the source said that person reached for a weapon in his waistband and pointed it at officers. Then, officials said, the officers opened fire. Witnesses said they heard six shots fired.

Police said Colon is a convicted felon on parole for unlawful use of a weapon. He was just released from prison.

"They're here to serve and protect, not to kill," said mother Maria Colon, crying. "They're killing innocent people."

Police say a loaded .357 Lugar handgun was found near the person shot. A witness on the scene said Luis Colon did have a gun.

"He was just gonna go put the gun down, and the cops shot him six times, you know? What kind of people do that these days?" said witness Destiny Pagan.

This is the ninth police shooting within two weeks. Five of them have been fatal.

A gang war is raging in the neighborhood where Luis Colon was shot, but just as great is the mistrust of law enforcement.

"The police stop us every day for no reason," said resident Moses Perez.

"They could've shot him in the leg. They could've shot him in the arm. Why did they shoot to kill him?" said Maria Colon in tears.
