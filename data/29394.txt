San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies on Monday, Dec. 28, shot to death a wanted man who they say rammed their patrol cars, brandished a machete and then attempted to re-arm himself with a rifle.

The 33-year-old man, whose name was not immediately disclosed, was being sought for the crimes of attempted murder, residential robbery and assault with a deadly weapon in the Barstow area, a sheriff’s news release said.

On Monday, detectives contacted the man, who was a passenger in a car in the 15700 block of Main Street in Hesperia. The driver got out and the suspect moved into the driver’s seat. The suspect ignored deputies’ orders to get out of the car and instead rammed their patrol cars, the release said.

The suspect then got out, armed with a machete. Deputies fired less-lethal projectiles and the suspect dropped the machete. But when he tried to arm himself with a rifle, deputies opened fire.

The suspect died at the scene.

The Sheriff’s Department asks anyone with information on the incident to call Detective James Tebbetts at 909-387-3589. Information may be left anonymously with WeTip at 800-782-7463 or the website wetip.com.
