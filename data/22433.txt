Hollywood police on Wednesday identified the two officers and the reckless driver they shot and killed last week.

Police say Matthew Michael McTague, 48, of Boca Raton, rammed other motorists with his Jeep Grand Cherokee and tried to hit officers when they tried to stop and arrest him.

The cops who fired their weapons are Carlos Perez, 29, and Karim Jaafar, 25, said Miranda Grossman, spokeswoman for the Hollywood Police Department.

Both officers were hired by the agency in 2016, records show.

McTague’s live-in fiancee of eight years, Susan Perry, 47, said Wednesday that she is certain McTague was suffering a hypoglycemic reaction when he was killed.

She had witnessed McTague have adverse reactions to low blood sugar before, she said. “The erratic driving would be an expected thing for him to do.”

“I can’t understand why they shot him,” she said. “He’s not criminal. He wasn’t fleeing. He would never not stop in his right mind.”

McTague, who worked in pharmaceutical manufacturing, did not have a criminal record in Florida, records show.

The trouble began Friday morning with a report of a reckless driver on Federal Highway near Sheridan Street in Hollywood.

Officers tried three times to stop and arrest McTague, police said.

Michael McTague, 48, of Boca Raton, (pictured with fiance Susan Perry) was shot and killed by Hollywood police on Sept. 15.

The final attempt ended with police shooting McTague to death near Northeast Sixth Street and Federal Highway in Hallandale Beach.

Bullet holes could be seen in McTague’s Jeep’s windows. McTague died at the scene.
