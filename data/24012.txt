Salt River Police Department said that a person who was shot by one of its officers March 23 near Scottsdale has since died.

The announcement on Tuesday did not provide any identifying information about the person who was fatally shot or the police officer who did it, nor did the statement say when that person succumbed to injuries.

It has been nearly two weeks since the shooting.

"This is currently an on-going investigation and there is no further information at this time," Detective Joseph Orozco said in a news release.

The FBI is investigating the shooting, Orozco said in the statement.

Salt River police said they were called about a person "making threats and gesturing that they had a weapon" at the Pavilions at Talking Stick Shopping Center, just east of the Loop 101, at about 11:30 a.m. March 23.

Orozco said the person was armed with an unspecified weapon and advanced on an officer "in a threatening manner." The officer then shot the person, who later died at the hospital, Orozco said.

Law enforcement in Maricopa County have shot 22 people, 14 fatally, so far in 2018.
