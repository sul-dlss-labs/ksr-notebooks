BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Authorities have released the identity of a gunman who wounded three people including a Birmingham police officer at St. Vincent's Hospital early today.

Birmingham police spokesman Sgt. Johnny Williams Jr. identified the man, who died from police gunfire, as Jason Letts, 38, of Jemison. Sources have told Al.com that Letts' wife was a patient on the hospital's 5th floor cardiac unit where the gun battle took place.

Letts, police said, shot an officer in the leg, and wounded two members of the hospital staff. He was apparently upset over his wife's care. All three victims were taken to UAB Hospital and are expected to survive.

Birmingham Police Chief A.C. Roper released this press statement: "In light of the recent mass shooting in Connecticut, too many of these incidents end with unimaginable tragedy. I am amazed at the bravery of our officers as they confronted this armed gunman in the hallway. I have absolutely no doubt that their courageous actions at that exact moment saved many lives. All of Birmingham should be proud and appreciative that these are the type of officers that protect our communities every day. The hospital staff and especially the security team should also be commended because they performed with selfless service which contained the incident until the officers' arrival."

"The results of this incident could have been much worse,'' Roper said. "However; due to several professionals from different walks of life putting the well-being of the patients and staff before themselves we suffered no additional loss of life."
