Sammie Lee Richardson, a 59-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police after leading them on a chase that ended when he rammed into police cruisers Thursday, March 12, according to authorities.

The chase ended shortly before 6 a.m. at 4th and San Pedro streets. At that point, police said Richardson continued to use his SUV to push one of the police cruisers sideways with an officer trapped inside. According to coroner's records, Richardson died of a gunshot wound to the head.

The Los Angeles Police Department also identified the officers involved in the shooting as Sgt. Alcenda Neal, a 15-year veteran of the department, and officers Jose Galvez, Hector Tejada and William Johnson, each of whom has two years with the department. At least five officers were taken to hospitals after the incident, but none suffered major injuries, LAPD Officer April Harding said.
