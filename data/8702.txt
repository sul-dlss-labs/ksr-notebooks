WENDELL, N.C. â€” Wake County deputies are searching for a man wanted in Monday's break-in at the Swift Mart on 1720 Marshburn Road in Wendell.

Investigators said Jonathan Edward Carr, 36, is known to frequent the Rocky Mount area. He is described as a black man, 5-foot-5 and 137 pounds, with brown eyes and black hair. He was previously convicted of drug and guns charges.

Police said three suspects broke into the Swift Mart around 4 a.m. Monday.

Around 8 a.m. Monday, deputies were in the area investigating the break-in when they got a report of two suspicious-looking men walking along N.C. Highway 97.

When deputies arrived, the men ran into a wooded area off of Green Pace Road, authorities said.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

K-9 units and a state Highway Patrol helicopter were called in to assist in the search for the two men, which lasted for about an hour, authorities said. When the men were finally located, one of the suspects, Cornelius Pierre Harrison, 25, of Rocky Mount, fought with Deputy Brad Manville. Manville shot and killed Harrison.

Manville's hand was injured in the altercation. Sheriff Donnie Harrison said the deputy was going to an orthopedist to determine if he needed surgery.

A K-9 caught the second suspect, Byron Lendell Williams, 24, of 115 Aqua Court in Rocky Mount. Williams was treated and released from WakeMed Hospital on Monday afternoon.

Williams is charged with breaking and entering and larceny, according to an arrest warrant. He is also charged with resisting Deputy J.A. Bennett.

Williams was being held under a $15,000 bond at the Wake County jail Tuesday.

Williams and Carr are each accused of taking $60 in cash and $200 worth of cigarettes from Swift Mart, according to arrest warrants.

The State Bureau of Investigation was reviewing Harrison's shooting, standard procedure when an officer fires his weapon.

Manville has been placed on administrative duty while the investigation is underway.
