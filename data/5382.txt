A woman killed by a sheriff’s deputy in Falls City was allegedly receiving two doses of a narcotic normally used to wean heroin addicts from the drug when she was shot.

On Thursday, the Nebraska State Patrol arrested the man officers believe delivered the synthetic narcotic, methadone, to Ann Marx on Aug. 13. William Snyder, 48, was arrested by the State Patrol on suspicion of delivering a controlled substance, a felony.

Snyder was booked into Richardson County Jail.

Marx was shot above her left eye by Richardson County sheriff’s deputy Todd Landis near the time of the alleged transaction on Aug. 13, Attorney General Jon Bruning has said.

Landis and another deputy were hiding outside Victory Village, an assisted-living facility, after getting a tip that Marx planned on buying drugs. Snyder is a resident of Victory Village, and Marx used to work there.

Bruning said during a press conference last month that Landis approached Marx’s vehicle with his gun drawn. Landis said that he accidentally shot Marx as he approached the vehicle, according to Bruning.

The incident will be investigated by a grand jury.
