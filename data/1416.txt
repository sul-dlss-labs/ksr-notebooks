Woman dies in fatal rollover SHERIDAN – A one-car rollover near Sheridan killed the driver and injured a passenger on Interstate 90.

The driver, Damara Rae Velikaneye, 28, of Sheridan, apparently tried to exit the interstate suddenly after speeding more than 100 mph Monday night, authorities said.

The car, a 1991 Ford Probe, hit an exit sign and rolled at least three times, Wyoming Highway Trooper Joe Arzy said. Both occupants were thrown from the car.

Arzy said he does not know whether alcohol played a role in the crash. A blood sample was taken from Velikaneye for testing at the state crime lab in Cheyenne.

The passenger, Gordon Leroy Barner, 40, was listed in fair condition at Deaconess Medical Center in Billings, Mont., Wednesday.Bebout raises $102,000RIVERTON – Former state House Speaker Eli Bebout says he has raised $102,000 toward a campaign for governor.

Bebout said more than 200 people have contributed to his campaign. And he has committed $42,000 of his own money.

Bebout has not formally declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor, but he says he has organized a campaign for the nomination in all 23 counties.

Gale Geringer of Cheyenne will manage his campaign. Geringer has managed statewide races for both U.S. Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi.

Republican Gov. Jim Geringer is prohibited by law from seeking a third term.Enzi praises education billCHEYENNE – The education bill signed into law by President Bush provides flexibility to rural school districts, Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., said.

Bush signed the bill Tuesday.

Enzi said the bill signals the beginning of a new and positive era of learning for Americas children.

This bill provides greater fairness and flexibility to local school districts, especially in rural areas, he said. It builds upon the hard work of educators in Wyoming and will fulfill an important commitment to the state, which is already heavily invested in improving student achievement. Our students deserve to have the resources they need and highly qualified teachers and this bill helps make that happen.

Enzi contributed to the bill as a member of the Senate-House Education Conference Committee.Speed limits unchanged in downtown SheridanSHERIDAN – The City Council has killed an ordinance that would have raised speed limits on Main Street in downtown to 30 mph.

The action Monday means the speed limit will remain at 20 mph.

A petition signed by more than 600 people opposed changing the speed limit.

Downtown business owners opposed the change, fearing the higher speed would jeopardize the safety of pedestrians.

While the downtown speed limit will remain the same, there was some question whether the city could keep the 20 mph speed limit on streets surrounding the downtown area. State law says speed limits in municipalities are to be 30 mph except in school zones, where the limit is 20.Woman killed while fleeing police identified as Wyoming residentWESTMINSTER, Colo. – A woman who died when her car crashed while she was fleeing police was identified Wednesday as Jackie Archuleta, 42, of Cheyenne, Wyo.

The Colorado State Patrol said investigators still dont know why Archuleta fled the scene of a hit-and-run accident Tuesday in northwest Westminster.

Westminster police spokesman Troy Cooper said a police chase began when the accident was reported at about 8 p.m. Cooper said the driver fled eastbound on U.S. 36.

The car was turning from U.S. 36 onto northbound Interstate 25 when it hit a guardrail and rolled several times. Archuleta was dead at the scene.Thomas says farm bill will help WyomingU.S. Sen. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said he expects Wyoming constituents will benefit from a farm bill pending in the Senate.

The Senate was unable to agree before the Christmas recess on a Democratic plan to reauthorize farm programs through 2006.

Thomas, a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said existing farm programs do not expire until October. The Senate will probably take up the issue again soon after they return from their holiday recess late next month, he said.

Our producers need some assurance going into spring planting that Congress is prepared to work out differences that will result in more market opportunities and an important safety net during emergencies, he said.

Issues that remain unresolved include crop subsidy levels, overall funding for agriculture and water rights, he said. The House has passed a version of the farm bill.

One benefit of the bill is a provision that bans meat packers from owning or having control of cattle or hogs within two weeks of their slaughter, he said. Another benefit is a provision to help farmers and ranchers comply with conservation requirements, he said.Economic developers to recruit laid off New Mexico mine workersGILLETTE – The Campbell County Economic Development Corp. plans to attend a job fair in Silver City, N.M., to recruit workers who have been laid off by a copper mine.

Chino Mines Grant County smelter and mine laid off about 200 workers this week. About 650 are expected to lose their jobs.

Elaine Roth, manager of the Gillette Employment Center, said local employers heard about the layoffs and expressed interest in recruiting the workers from Chino Mines.

The laid-off workers have skills that are needed in Campbell County, she said. About 170 job openings are listed at the Gillette Employment Center and the number is expected to rise as construction season approaches, she said.

Workers needed in Campbell County include heavy equipment operators, welders, truck drivers and mechanics.

Campbell County Economic Development will send two representatives to the job fair Feb. 1.Police discover husband was driving pickup truck in fatal crashSCOTTSBLUFF, Neb. – Authorities investigating a car accident that killed a Wyoming woman say the husband of a woman charged in the fatal crash was actually driving the other vehicle.

James Eller III, 25, of Torrington, Wyo., has been charged with misdemeanor motor vehicle homicide and providing false information.

Investigators said Eller was on probation for a burglary in Wyoming and did not have a valid drivers license at the time of the fatal crash.

During a Wednesday hearing in Circuit Court in Torrington, he waived extradition to Scotts Bluff County. He still must face proceedings in Laramie, Wyo., about probation revocation charges before being transferred to Nebraska.

Ellers 19-year-old wife, April, was charged with motor vehicle homicide last month for allegedly causing the traffic death.

She was accused of driving a pickup truck near Morrill on Dec. 3 when it made an improper pass that resulted in a collision that killed 47-year-old Cynthia Green of Fort Laramie, Wyo.

Scotts Bluff Deputy County Attorney Doug Warner said further investigation determined April Eller was not driving the pickup. A statement to investigators from a friend of the couple indicated James Eller was the driver.

Warner said any changes to the charge against April Eller will come before her next court appearance scheduled in April.
