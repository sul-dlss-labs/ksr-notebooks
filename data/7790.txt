A man killed earlier today when burglary suspects fleeing police crashed into his vehicle has been identified as 51-year-old Keith Shoemaker of Birmingham, said Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Pat Curry.

Events leading to the fatal crash began when an officer in the East Precinct Burglary Task Force saw three men burglarizing a home at 740 Biscayne Drive and asked for assistance, said Lt. Henry Irby, a spokesman for the police department.



Once marked police cruisers arrived, Irby said, police began looking for the car spotted at the burglary. Moments later, the suspects' vehicle struck another vehicle at 9200 Parkway East. The suspects jumped out of their car and ran, but were captured a short time later, Irby said. They were riding in a silver Chevrolet Malibu.

Paramedics arrived at the scene and pronounced the other driver dead. He was driving a blueish/green Toyota Corolla.

The suspects are being held on a 48-hour extension and police will meet with prosecutors on Wednesday to discuss potential charges including murder, said Birmingham homicide Sgt. Scott Thurmond.

No one else was injured in the crash.
