Overview

Phoenix Police say they received multiple calls about a man shooting a gun in the area of 10th Street and Pierce on Saturday night.

Two patrol vehicles responded to the call and when the officers arrived at the scene, they attempted to contact the suspect, but he fled on foot southbound on 10th Street. The second patrol unit drove towards the suspect and engaged him near 10th Street and Taylor.

“One officer from this unit began giving verbal commands to this suspect as he observed a gun in the suspects hand. These commands went ignored and the suspects began to raise the handgun pointing it towards the officer. The officer discharged his weapon at the suspect. The suspect then fled around a private residence into a backyard,” stated Sgt. Steve Martos.

After officers established a perimeter around the area, during a search, officers found the deceased suspect in the backyard of a residence near Roosevelt and 7th Streets.

“The suspect died as a result of the officer shooting him. He did not die from a self inflicted gunshot wound. Detectives located shell casings in the suspect’s possession from the earlier shots fired calls officers responded to,” explained Martos.
