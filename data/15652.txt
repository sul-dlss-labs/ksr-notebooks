A Birmingham man running from police was killed when he was struck by a train over the weekend.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office today identified the man as Vincent Palance Chancellor. He was 50.

Birmingham police on Saturday were dispatched about 4:45 p.m. to the 1400 block of 36th Street North on a report of burglary. Authorities said they received a call about two men stealing metal off of a stopped train.

When officers arrived, the two men ran off and a short foot chase followed but officers lost sight of them. A short time later, police heard a man yelling. That's when they found Chancellor had been hit by a different train.

Chancellor was taken to UAB Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 7:05 p.m. Saturday. Court records show Chancellor had previous convictions for property crimes.
