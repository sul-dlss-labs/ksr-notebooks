MIDWEST CITY, Oklahoma â€“ A suspect in a bar fight and fatal police chase in Midwest City now faces a possible first-degree murder charge.

Midwest City police were called to Snarky's Hideaway on Harmon Drive at 1:00 a.m. Friday, March 25, 2011 when someone punched a bartender.

When police arrived, the fight had spilled into the parking lot. Officers said they found several people standing around a man who'd been beaten up. Three suspects, two men and a woman, jumped into their pickup truck when they saw police.

Officers said the driver, 22-year-old Jason Holt, tried to run over the beating victim and a police officer. Holt then rammed his truck into the officer's patrol car, hit several other vehicles in the parking lot and sped off.

Police pursued the suspects in two separate patrol cars. Speeds during the chase reached up to 100 mph. After just a few minutes, Holt's truck hit a curb and lost control at Interstate 40 and Scott Street. The truck rolled onto an embankment and one of the passengers, 22-year-old John Benjiman Spencer of Del City, was ejected.

Spencer was transported to a local hospital where he died just before 4 a.m. Holt was treated and released from the hospital. He's now in Midwest City Jail facing a first-degree murder charge because Spencer's death occurred during the commission of a felony. He also faces felony charges of assault with a deadly weapon, assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer and leaving the scene of an accident.

Another passenger in the car, 25-year-old Hayley Jackson, was treated for minor injuries at the scene and arrested for public intoxication.

A third suspect, Aaron Alsept, was arrested at an apartment complex near Snarky's Hideaway when he tried to run from officers. He faces charges of obstructing an officer and possession of a controlled dangerous substance.
