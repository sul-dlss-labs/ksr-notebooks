LAKE PANASOFFKEE â€” A man holed up up in his Sumter County home fired several rounds at deputies before finally turning the gun on himself Sunday night.

According to the Sumter County Sheriff's Office, deputies went to the home about 10:30 p.m. Sunday because of what they termed a domestic dispute. They tried to make contact with the 61-year-old man, but he refused to cooperate and at one point fired a shot out the front door. The Sumter County Sheriff's Office SWAT team responded with hostage negotiators, who again tried to contact with man without success.

According to deputies, the man then fired several rounds at the SWAT team, striking the SWAT vehicle multiple times. He then turned the gun on himself and was pronounced dead at the scene from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
