BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — A Bakersfield police officer is back on full duty after his involvement in a shooting that left 21-year-old Christopher Alexander Okamoto dead.

According to a news release from BPD, On May 30 a Critical Incident Review Board determined that all shots fired by Senior Officer Alejandro Patino on August 19, 2018, were within department policy and within legal requirements.

The shooting happened around 11:30 p.m. near the front door of a second floor apartment at the Autumn Creek Apartments on Hahn Avenue, across from the Fellowship Baptist Church.

Officers say that a neighbor called because of a domestic violence situation. When officers arrived, they found Okamoto in the doorway armed with what was later identified as a Umarex H&K bb/pellet pistol with design features identical to an H&K semi-automatic firearm.

This is when officers say the shooting occurred. The man was shot and killed during the incident.

A woman and an infant were later found inside the apartment. No one else was injured.

Officer Patino has been with the department since January 2007 and officials said that it was his first officer involved shooting.

The news release also stated that Chief Martin concurred with the Review Board’s findings.
