STAFF REPORTS

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating the death of a Brownsville man fatally shot by a Jackson police officer at Jackson-Madison County General Hospital Saturday night.

JMCGH security members encountered a "combative individual" identified as 42-year-old Marcus Mann inside the emergency room entrance, according to a statement from the TBI and the Jackson Police Department.

An officer with the Jackson Police Department, who was in the ER, responded to assist. The officer has not yet been identified.

The JPD officer fired a shot that struck Mann after a physical altercation, according to preliminary information from the TBI's investigation.

Officers and on-site medical personnel immediately performed life-saving measures, but Mann died of his injuries.

Amy Garner, the chief compliance officer for West Tennessee Healthcare who owns JMCGH, issued a statement Sunday evening.

"Out of respect for individuals' privacy rights, we are unable to provide any additional details outside of the TBI's recent press release. We are cooperating fully with investigating agencies, and our emergency department is treating patients and is fully operational at this time."

District Attorney Jody Pickens requested TBI investigate the shooting, and agents are working to independently determine the series of events leading to the shooting, including collecting evidence and conducting interviews.

TBI will share its investigative findings with Pickens, who will determine if the officer's actions were justified.
