GRAY, Tenn. (AP) – Authorities say sheriff’s deputies in Tennessee shot and killed an armed man while responding to a domestic disturbance at a home.

News media outlets quote the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation as saying that deputies from the Washington County Sheriff’s office fatally shot 70-year-old Larry Grant Whitehead on Tuesday night.

Bureau spokeswoman Leslie Earhart says Whitehead was armed with a gun. She says the deputies fired shots at Whitehead after a confrontation, killing him at the scene.

Washington County Sheriff Ed Graybeal says his deputies were protecting themselves. Authorities did not say if Whitehead fired his weapon at officials during the encounter, which is under investigation.
