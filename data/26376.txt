July 31, 2019 - Houston police are investigating the suicide of a male who shot himself in the presence of HPD patrol officers at 6311 French Chateau Drive about 11 p.m. on Tuesday (July 30).



The identity of the male, 30, is pending verification by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.



HPD Homicide Division Lieutenant W. Meeler and Detective E. Aguilera reported:



Officers were dispatched to a shooting in-progress call at a residence at the above address and arrived to find a male inside a vehicle on the street flashing his lights at them. The officers exited their patrol vehicles and noticed the male holding a handgun to his head. As officers tried to establish communication with the male, he shot himself in the head. Officers quickly provided first aid until paramedics arrived. The male was pronounced deceased a short time later at Ben Taub General Hospital.



Investigators learned from the maleâ€™s roommates that he was acting erratically before he left the residence and had fired multiple rounds into the home before officers arrived.



As is customary when an individual dies in the presence of officers, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions.
