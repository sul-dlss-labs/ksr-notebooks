A man shot and killed himself Wednesday in a standoff with Danville Police.

Investigators say an officer approached Christopher Bennett at the intersection of Church Street and Keen Street around 2:30 p.m. about an outstanding warrant. Bennett pulled a gun on the officer, threatened him by saying "I'm going to kill you," then ran away.

The officer took out his weapon and told Bennett to drop the gun. Bennett ran from the officer across North Main Street.

The officer called for help and multiple officers responded. Bennett was found on Sunnyside Street still holding the gun. Bennett refused to drop his weapon as instructed by officers.

Bennett agreed to drop his gun if a specific officer he knew would speak with him. The officer was off duty at the time. But he ended up negotiating with Bennett over the phone before the officer arrived to the scene. He asked Bennett many times to drop the gun and surrender. Bennett refused to put the gun down.

After negotiating with officers for more than 45 minutes, Bennett put the gun up to his head and shot himself.

Emergency personnel responded immediately. Bennett was transported to Danville Regional Medical Center and was pronounced dead at 4:43 p.m.
