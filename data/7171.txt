A man who killed himself Tuesday after a standoff with police that lasted more than 17 hours has been identified as a Waukegan resident, authorities said.

Terry Galmore, 23, of the 1600 block of 11th Street barricaded himself in his apartment at 3 a.m., and after hours of negotiation, he exchanged gunfire with police and killed himself about 8:30 p.m., officials said.

Police had tried to persuade Galmore to surrender, but he refused, threatening to shoot anyone who entered the home, authorities said.

Shots were heard several times during the impasse, and Galmore at one point fired at an armored police truck, authorities said.

Galmore, who has a robbery conviction, is believed to be one of three people involved in a Monday night robbery in the 2300 block of North Corona Road in Waukegan, where a woman was bound with duct tape and robbed, police said.

The victim identified Galmore through a photo lineup, officials said. Police arrested a second man and were still searching for the third Wednesday afternoon, officials said.

The standoff with Galmore concluded when officers entered the home and found him on the floor of the apartment with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.
