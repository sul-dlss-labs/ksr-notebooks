Deputy who fatally shot man he was transporting cleared

STATESVILLE, N.C. (AP) — An Iredell County prosecutor says a Davidson County sheriff’s deputy will not face criminal charges for fatally shooting a man last October along Interstate 40.

The Winston-Salem Journal reports Sgt. Scott Culler was cleared of wrongdoing Thursday in the death of 41-year-old Adam Daniel Lopp along I-40 in Iredell County. Authorities say the shooting occurred after Lopp assaulted Culler while in handcuffs. An autopsy report released Wednesday shows Lopp died from two gunshot wounds to the upper chest and abdomen. Another bullet grazed his right arm.

An investigative report says Culler discharged pepper spray and an electrical controlled device, neither of which were successful in controlling the decedent.

Mikko Red Arrow, an assistant district attorney, says there was insufficient evidence to warrant a criminal prosecution.
