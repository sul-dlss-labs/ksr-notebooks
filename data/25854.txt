A suspect in a shots-fired call was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Fairbanks late Sunday, Alaska State Troopers said.

Troopers and members of the Fairbanks Police Department responded to a report of shots fired at 8:30 p.m. on Loftus Drive, according to a troopers dispatch posted late Sunday.

The suspect, Kevin Ray McEnulty, 25, left the area in a vehicle before law enforcement arrived, troopers said. The vehicle was located soon after in a nearby Geist Road parking lot. Fairbanks police initiated a traffic stop. Troopers arrived a short time later; members of the University of Alaska Fairbanks police department also arrived.

The suspect brandished a firearm and was “ultimately fired upon” by troopers at 8:51 p.m., troopers said. The suspect was treated by medics but died of the injuries.

An investigation into the incident continues by the troopers and Fairbanks police.

The name or names of the trooper or troopers who fired their service weapon will be released approximately 72 hours from the time of the shooting incident, as per standard procedure.
