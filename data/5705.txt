HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- A shooting review board has ruled that two Huntsville police officers were within department policy when they shot a driver and his passenger to death on December third.

The shooting happened after the driver's vehicle struck one of the officers while apparently trying to flee a crime scene.

The police departments incident review board concluded that the actions of the driver led to his death and the death of the passenger. The driver has been identified as Mario Ayala and the passenger as Oscar Rodriguez.

The review's board's decision was released in a statement from police spokesman Wendell Johnson.

The names of the officers have not been released.

In his statement, Johnson said a witness testified at the hearing that the vehicle struck one of the officers twice before shots were fired.
