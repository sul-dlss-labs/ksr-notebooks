Overview

The family of a man shot dead by a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper wants answers about what happened the morning he was killed on Interstate 15.

With tears in his eyes, John T. Wilson II said that his “world was changed” the day his son, John T. Wilson III, died.

“My world was turned around, I was shocked, confused, angry and sad,” Wilson said Wednesday. “I still have the same questions.”

The younger Wilson was shot and killed early Nov. 1 after a confrontation with a trooper on the interstate. NHP had received calls about a pedestrian walking on northbound I-15 carrying what was described as a “high-powered rifle,” the patrol said.

Troopers created a traffic break, a maneuver to clear traffic swiftly, before contacting Wilson south of Sahara Avenue. That’s where trooper William White shot him, NHP said.

Wilson, 22, died of a gunshot wound to the back, according to the Clark County coroner’s office.

His family said they learned that the weapon was a pellet gun.

The shooting prompted the highway closing in both directions for about seven hours while authorities investigated.

In a statement released before a Wednesday news conference, the family said the details surrounding Wilson’s death were “sketchy.” At the news conference, they said they simply wanted answers from authorities and a “peaceful resolution.”
