A male suspected of drug dealing died after he was Tased during a physical confrontation with three police officers in Thornton late Thursday night, police say.

Three officers were taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries and released. The names of the suspect and the officers who were involved in the incident have not been released.

Thornton police officers responded at 10:46 p.m. to reports of a possible drug deal involving two pickup trucks in the parking lot of the Western Convenience Store at 9190 N. Huron St., according to a news release by police spokesman Matt Barnes.

One suspect ran away from a black pickup truck, crossing Huron Street. A Thornton officer chased the suspect through the parking lot of a medical office building in the 9100 block of North Huron.

The suspect then struck the officer, Barnes says. When other police officers arrived the suspect continued to fight them, Barnes says.

A Federal Heights police officer fired a Taser at the suspect and the man was arrested, Barnes said. The suspect immediately “experienced a medical episode.”

Officers requested medical assistance and began to perform CPR. The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 12:32 a.m., Barnes said.

Officers recovered a large amount of money and suspected narcotics from the suspect’s pickup truck.

The cause of death will be determined by the Adams County Coroner’s Office.

The 17th Judicial District Critical Incident Team is investigating the incident.
