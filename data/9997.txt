NORTH PLATTE, Neb. (AP) - A grand jury has cleared two North Platte police officers who fatally shot a 60-year-old man who brandished knives as he attacked the officers in the lobby of the police station.

North Platte television station KNOP is reporting that the decision Wednesday cleared officers Rick Harms and Gary Hovey in the shooting of Marlon Johnson on March 25.

Authorities say Johnson entered the building around 2:30 a.m. and started a fire in a recycling bin. He attacked the officers when they responded. They fired their stun guns, but he continued attacking. They then shot him with their handguns.

State law requires a grand jury investigation whenever someone dies in police custody or while being apprehended.
