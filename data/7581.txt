The plainclothes officers, one of them a lieutenant, drove up and stayed in their car about 20 or 30 feet from the club, watching the group, Chief Collins said.

Another car pulled up, a blue Dodge Charger, which the officers at first believed was carrying other officers. But a man emerged from the car and was heard to say, “Give me the ratchet.” Someone then handed him a gun, Chief Collins said. The man and two others in the Charger ran toward the group outside the club, and one of them fired shots at the group, Chief Collins said.

The chief said the lieutenant and the officer believed all three men were armed, although the officers had not been formally questioned Sunday evening. They identified themselves as police officers and were wearing their badges outside their clothing, Chief Collins said.

One man fled, while the other two rushed toward the officers, who believed they were firing at them, Chief Collins said. The officer fired 16 times, emptying his Smith & Wesson semiautomatic pistol. The lieutenant, who was on the other side of the car and farther from the rushing men, fired his revolver once. Neither man had ever fired a gun in the line of duty, Chief Collins said. The officers’ names were not released on Sunday.

The lieutenant joined the Police Department in October 1990, and the officer in January 2005, Chief Collins said.
