Nahun Garcia, a 23-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by Huntington Park police Wednesday, July 13, in the 2600 block of Zoe Avenue in Huntington Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Shortly after 2 p.m., officers responded to a call of an armed robbery in progress in the 6600 block of Pacific Boulevard, according to a report from the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department. The department investigates officer-involved shootings in many smaller towns in the county.

As the officers arrived, authorities said, Garcia ran from the store, allegedly with a bag full of stolen property. He fled on foot, with one officer following on foot and others in two cars.

The chase continued into the 2600 block of Zoe Avenue. There, Garcia turned and pointed a gun at the officer chasing on foot, officials said. Garcia was shot and killed; the report from the Sheriff's Department does not say how many officers were involved.

No officers were injured in the incident. A gun was recovered at the scene, according to the report.
