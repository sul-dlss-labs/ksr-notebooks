A D.C. man has been sentenced to 12 years in prison for a violent crash that killed two young women in Prince George's County.

Ronald Hayes was charged with two counts of negligent motor vehicle manslaughter.

On Dec. 8, 2013, Hayes was being pursued by police when he crashed into a minivan carrying six people. Hayes was traveling more than 80 mph in a 25 mph zone with his headlights off.

Two women -- 21-year-old Brittney Queen and 23-year-old Brittany Everett -- were killed in the collision. Four other passengers, including two young children, were also injured.

Queen's mother told News4 her daughter was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of the crash.

A female passenger in Hayes' car also was injured.

"Mr. Hayes' breathtaking disregard for human life resulted in the deaths of two beautiful young women, robbing them of the promise they had shown and devastating two families forever," Prince George's County State's Attorney Angela Alsobrooks said.

Hayes was also sentenced to five years of probation.
