The driver of a car involved in a crash with an on-duty Prince George's County police officer has died.

The accident happened at the intersection of London Lane and Md. Route 197 in Bowie around 3 a.m. Wednesday. The officer was responding to an unrelated crash when he collided with the civilian car, striking the driver's side of the vehicle and killing 32-year-old James Dejay Toliver of Upper Marlboro.

Cpl. Michael Mogavero, a nine-year veteran of the force, was treated at a hospital for non-life-threatening injuries and released. He was assigned to the Special Operations Division.

The Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Unit is working to determine fault. Investigators are reviewing dashcam video to determine if the officer's lights and sirens were on.

“It is a tragic incident and the Prince George’s County Police Department believes in being transparent," Deputy Chief Hector Valez said. "What we want to do is put everything out, tell everyone what occurred and we are investigating the incident and we will provide updates as they come along.”

Route 197 was shut down for about two hours as crews cleared the scene.
