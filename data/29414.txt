BEAUMONT, Texas — Beaumont Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that resulted in the death of a suicidal suspect.

Beaumont Police officers responded to call in about a suicidal man with a gun at the intersection of South Dowlen Rd. and College St just before 5 a.m. Thursday.

Patrol officers arrived at the location and tried to de-escalate the situation for hours, but the 39-year-old man would not comply, according to a news release from Beaumont Police.

Around 7:30 a.m., the armed man started shooting, which led to an officer returning fire, police said. The man was pronounced dead on the scene.

Jefferson County Precinct One Justice of the Peace Ben Collins, Sr. identified the man who was shot at David Randall Shepherd, 39. Shepherd is a transient, he said.

A SWAT team and Beaumont Police officers responded to the situation, the release said. No one else was injured during the incident.

Beaumont Police said the investigation is ongoing.

This is the seventh officer-involved shooting in Beaumont since 2015. It's also the third one this year.
