Authorities have positively identified a Florida woman as the driver in last week's fatal high speed chase.

Dorothy Marie Roberson, 32, of St. Augustine, Fla., died at the scene of the Aug. 7 single vehicle crash on Hwy. 52, near Walker Drive, just inside Dawson County at the Gilmer County line.

Officers with multiple agencies spent much of the week following the crash attempting to identify the woman, according to Georgia State Patrol spokeswoman Robin Stone.

"It took us all week and [Thursday] we finally got results back from GBI, because they were involved in identifying her," she said Friday. "Once we got word from them, then we had to get in touch with family members."

Police reports show Roberson was fleeing officers when she lost control, left the roadway and crashed into trees before coming to a stop down a steep embankment, where the truck overturned and caught fire.

Local deputies said officers in Gilmer County were in pursuit of the vehicle when Roberson crossed over into Dawson County.

"She died from injuries sustained in the crash, but she was not burned," said Robin Stone. "The driver was operating a motor vehicle in an erratic, careless manner...exceeding posted speed limits."

The truck she was driving had been previously reported stolen out of Lafayette, La. the week before.

The investigation remains open.

"There are multiple agencies involved in this that are working together to determine what led her here," Stone said.

Roberson's death marks the seventh fatality on Dawson County roads since the beginning of the year.
