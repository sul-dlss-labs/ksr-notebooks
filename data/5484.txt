A man wanted on a drug warrant was shot and killed by Aurora police Sunday night on the 800 block of Oswego Street.

Police have not identified the dead man or the two officers involved in the shooting.

The officers have been suspended with pay pending an investigation of the shooting.

The incident happened at about 10 p.m., said police spokesman Robert Friel.

The uniformed officers approached the man, who was in a late-model, four-door Ford Explorer, to take him into custody on the drug warrant when police fired on the victim. He died at the scene.

Investigators took a gun from the Explorer, Friel said.

The shooting is being investigated by the police department’s Major Crime Unit and will be turned over to the Arapahoe County District Attorney’s Office.
