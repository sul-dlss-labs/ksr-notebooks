CHICAGO (CBS) -- One person was killed and two others were wounded in a shootout Friday morning in the North Austin neighborhood, and three people were in custody, as SWAT teams remained on the scene hours later.

Chicago police said, around 10:30 a.m., 25th (Grand Central) District tactical officers responded to a call of a man with a gun near Potomac and Mason avenues. When they arrived on the scene, they saw four people get out of two cars in front of a home in the 1200 block of North Mason Avenue, and start shooting at the house.

People inside the home returned fire, shooting one of the attackers, as other assailants fled the scene in the two vehicles.

The assailant who was shot was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Two people who were wounded inside the home also went to the hospital, but their conditions were not available.

One of the vehicles that fled the scene was later found burned out near Lockwood and Chicago avenues. The second vehicle that fled the scene crashed in Oak Park near Austin Boulevard and Harrison Street. Oak Park police said the driver ran off after crashing, but was arrested in the 700 block of Lyman Avenue, with the help of Chicago police and a canine unit.

Chicago police said two other people were in the custody of Area Five detectives.

SWAT teams were still on the scene on Mason Avenue early Friday afternoon. Two adults and a child were safely removed from the home after the shooting.
