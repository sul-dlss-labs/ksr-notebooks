Two people died and another was injured when the driver of a stolen car sped off from a traffic stop and crashed into a light pole and two other cars before flipping over in the South Deering neighborhood.

The driver, Ronald Greenfield, and a woman in the front seat named Elisha Q. Heard, were killed, authorities said. A woman in the back seat of the 2006 Toyota Camry was ejected before the car came to rest and police said that may have saved her life.



Police had curbed the car for a minor traffic violation at 108th Street and Bensley Avenue late Saturday night, officials said. But the car took off as officers got out and approached, police said. The officers later learned the car had been taken in an armed carjacking in Dolton.



After speeding off, the driver of the stolen car made a left turn at Torrence, hit a curb and lost control, police said. The car hit a light pole and the pole's foundation, tilted and hit two other cars before rolling over them, police said.



Greenfield was 22 but it was not known where he lived, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office. Heard, 23, was of the 15400 block of South Ashland Avenue in Harvey, according to the medical examiner's office.

The woman who survived, 20, was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital in serious but stable condition, police said.
