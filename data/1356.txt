A 28-year-old man has been charged with "making terroristic threats" against a Birmingham police officer who shot and killed his brother in Dec. 2001, according to Birmingham police.

Travis Harper is the brother of Carlos Williams, a 21-year-old who was shot and killed by Officer Lorenzo Hughes as Hughes attempted to arrest Williams at a Woodlawn apartment in connection with a robbery investigation.

Harper approached Hughes, who was off-duty, at church and accused him of "murdering his brother," according to a statement issued by Sgt. Johnny Williams.

Sgt. Williams said police aren't sure if Harper attended the church, but said worship services weren't disrupted and Harper wasn't arrested at the time.

"The officer informed the suspect that he did not murder his brother, but the suspect insisted and also made more threatening remarks to the officer," the statement continued.

Carlos Williams was arrested twice in the last nine months of his life and was declared a fugitive that November when he did not show up for court.

When Hughes went to the apartment to arrest Williams on an outstanding warrant, Williams went into a bedroom, closed the door, then opened it brandishing a 9mm pistol, police said. That's when Hughes opened fire.

Then Jefferson County District Attorney David Barber in Jan. 2002 said that although Williams did not fire a shot, as police originally reported, Hughes was justified in using deadly force because Williams pointed a gun at him as he exited a bedroom.

Barber said Hughes at the time believed Williams had shot at him. "I think the officer was hearing his own shots," Barber told The News in 2002.

In the days following the shooting, Williams' relatives and civil rights leaders condemned the shooting as an example of "trigger-happy police."
