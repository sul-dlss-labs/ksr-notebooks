Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said Friday that a man shot by police on July 31 has died.

The shooting was justified, he added, and no officer will be charged.

Richard Schneider, 46, had been wanted for several felonies, Deters said, when officers with Green Township and Cheviot converged in Westwood near the former Mercy High School. An officer from Cheviot and one from Green Township fired at Schneider.

Schneider, of Crescent Springs, Kentucky, had fled police from Green Township, leading them into Westwood.

Deters said he died early Friday morning.

He was armed with an unloaded gun that Deters called "inoperable" due to its poor condition.

The man walked across a street slowly and pointed a gun at police, Deters said.

One officer took cover behind a tree.

"No one takes delight with someone dying," Deters said. "But I can tell you this: If you aim a gun at a police officer, youâ€™re going to get shot, and he did."

Deters commended the bravery of the officers.

Schneider had previously stolen a vehicle with a 15-year-old inside. The teen was able to escape but suffered minor injuries.

Police video was shown during a news conference of the shooting, showing Schneider try to enter a person's home before officers shot at him. A woman stopped him from entering.

Covington police earlier confirmed he was wanted in a string of robberies earlier this week in Covington and Hyde Park.

Schneider was also accused of robbing Kimmy's Korner Grocery at gunpoint in Covington.

A customer there was also robbed of his wallet and cell phone, officials said.

"This guy was a human crime spree," Deters said. "His record is hideous."

This was the third officer-involved shooting in Greater Cincinnati this year.
