LEWISTON, Maine — State police say a high-speed chase on the Maine Turnpike ended when the car they were chasing crashed and burst into flames, killing the driver.

On Friday, the Maine State Police identified the driver as Luis Andrades-Garcia of Portland. His age was not provided.

According to police, a trooper began chasing the car that belonged to a friend of Andrades-Garcia at around 7:30 p.m. Thursday after getting reports of an erratic driver on the turnpike. They say the car was speeding over 100 mph, and crashed at a construction site in Lewiston near the Lisbon Road overpass.

WCSH-TV reports Andrades-Garcia did not have a driver’s license and recently had served time at the Maine Correctional Center in Windham for a drug conviction.
