MIAMI â€“ A man who had threatened to shoot a woman and ran into traffic in Miami's East Little Havana died during a struggle to get away from police officers on Saturday, according to the City of Miami Police Department.

Officer Yelitza V. Cedano said police officers responded to a laundromat at 698 West Flagler St., and found the man was acting aggressively.

Cedano said the man was "in an altered state" and was "behaving in an erratic manner." She also said he "appeared to be high on narcotics ... and the officers on scene restrained him for his safety."

The man died after he tried to kick the police officers, Cedano said. The police officers reported the man stopped breathing and collapsed.

The police officers called Miami Fire Rescue and began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation, Cedano said. Paramedics determined he was dead.

Miami detectives were asking anyone with information to call 305-603-6350 or Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-8477.
