An armed robbery in the 9800 block of Baymeadows Road ended about 2 miles away Friday afternoon when police chasing the suspects' car spun and stopped it on Baymeadows Way, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said.

Two of the three suspects attempted to flee but were taken into custody and the driver was dead.

"At some time the suspect may have sustained a gunshot wound prior to police approaching the vehicle," Sheriff's Office spokesman Christian Hancock said. "This will be determined with the medical examiner's finding, and the other two suspects will be interviewed to ascertain what happened to this suspect. ... At no time in this incident did any officer fire his or her service weapon."

The armed robbery occurred about 4 p.m. on Baymeadows Road on the east side of Interstate 95, the Sheriff's Office said. Details about the robbery were not released, other than the suspects "had weapons" and the victim was not injured.

Officers alerted to the incident spotted the suspect's blue car heading west on Baymeadows Road and gave chase as it turned north onto Baymeadows Way.

The chase ended about 4:20 p.m. at the Baypine Road intersection when a pursuing officer tapped its back bumper to spin it, Hancock said.

Hancock said officers, then the Jacksonville Fire and Rescue Department, worked on the driver after he was pulled from the front seat, but he was dead at the scene.

Police were still working around the blue car, sitting sideways on Baymeadows Way, late into the evening as the investigation forced the road's closure in the middle of the Deerwood Center.
