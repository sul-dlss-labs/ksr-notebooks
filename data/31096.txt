BALTIMORE â€” An investigation is underway after a man crashed and died during an overnight police pursuit.

Around 2:46am Saturday, an officer with the Maryland Transportation Police Authority spotted a car speeding and weaving in and out of lanes near I-395 and Conway Street.

The officer followed the vehicle onto I-95 south, where he tried pulling the car over.

Instead, the driver sped away and exited onto I-695. The officer continued the chase, believing the driver was impaired.

Upon taking the Wilkens Avenue exit ramp, the fleeing driver lost control causing the vehicle to hit the median. The impact caused the suspect to be thrown from the vehicle, killing him.

He's been identified as 26-year-old Jawuan James Ginyard, of Baltimore. It's unclear if he was impaired.

The involved officer is 10-year MDTA Police veteran, Theodore Jeremenko. Investigators say his dashboard camera and microphone were active throughout the incident.

An investigation into his conduct is ongoing.
