PORT ALLEN, LA (WAFB) - It's a drug deal the sheriff says went sour. An undercover narcotics agent shot and killed a masked man after he pulled a gun on them. It happened around six Wednesday afternoon at the Motel 6 in Port Allen.

Red lights and crime tape circling rooms at the motel was not how an undercover drug bust was supposed to end.

"Over the 31 years I've been in law enforcement, we've never had a drug deal go sour on us," said West Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff Mike Cazes.

Cazes says undercover narcotics agents were "making buys" in known drug areas. Wednesday, they say Melissa Moye, 31, set up a deal. Her boyfriend, Taryn Hutchinson, 32, drove her there.

The sheriff says an agent was waiting in a motel room to buy $50 of Loritab.

Cazes says Moye walked in the room and shut the door, but then opened it again and a masked man rushed in.

"Came through the door immediately shoved her down and started having a gun at the agent. The agent kicked him, gave him money he was asking for and started shooting," said Cazes.

Sheriff Cazes says the masked man was Eric Williams, 18. He says Williams was trying to fire a loaded .45.

"The only reason the agent's still alive is the bad guy, the gun he had was on safety."

The undercover agent shot Williams four times. State police are investigating, but Sheriff Cazes says his agent acted by the book.

Both Melissa Moye and her boyfriend are now in the West Baton Rouge Parish prison, both on a $1 million bond. The couple is charged with principal to armed robbery by use of a firearm.
