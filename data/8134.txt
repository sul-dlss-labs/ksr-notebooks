Mitchell Marien, a 23-year-old white man, was shot and killed on Thursday, May 28, by an off-duty Gardena police officer in 17800 block of Lakewood Boulevard in Bellflower, authorities said.

Marien and another man were attempting to rob a Norms Restaurant shortly after 2 a.m., according to Los Angeles County sheriff's investigators. An off-duty officer from the Gardena Police Department was eating in the restaurant at the time and intervened in the robbery, said Los Angeles County sheriff's homicide Det. Lt. Gil Carrillo.

Carrillo said the officer, a five-year veteran whose name was not immediately released, identified himself as a law enforcement officer after Marien pointed an 8-inch knife at two employees and began pushing them toward the back of the restaurant.

Marien then allegedly ran toward and lunged at the officer with the knife. At that point, the officer shot Marien several times. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A knife was recovered, Carrillo said. A possible second suspect turned himself in at the Lakewood sheriff's station, where he was question by homicide detectives, sheriff's officials said.

The incident marked the second violent robbery attempt at the restaurant that Carrillo has investigated. In 2005, two deputies from the L.A. County Sheriffâ€™s station in Lakewood were involved in a gun battle with a gunman who attempted to rob the restaurant. Carrillo said the suspect in that robbery also was killed.
