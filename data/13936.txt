SHOTS FIRED

Police shootings in Arizona

Arizona ranks in the nationâ€™s top 5 states in fatal police shootings, one study says. And in 2018, Phoenix officers fired at more people than did officers in any other major city.

Arizona Republic reporters built a database including each law-enforcement shooting reviewed by a county attorney from 2011 to 2018.
