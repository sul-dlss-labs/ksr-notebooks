URBANDALE, Iowa (AP) -- Two brothers shot and killed by police after a bank robbery and a high-speed chase in this Des Moines suburb were armed only with BB guns, police said Wednesday.

Two BB guns were recovered at the scene. One was found along the road the men had traveled Tuesday morning as they fled police, police Sgt. Doug Hobart said.

The men were identified Wednesday as Charles Simmons, 45, of Pasadena, Calif., and Paul Simmons, 47, of Des Moines.

A third brother, Terry Simmons, 56, and Jeanette Freeman, 24, of Pasadena, Calif., were arrested unharmed. They were being held Wednesday in the Polk County Jail on first-degree robbery charges, Hobart said.

The chase followed the robbery of a West Bank branch in Urbandale about 10:45 a.m. Tuesday. Three armed men had demanded money and fled with an undetermined amount of cash, Hobart said.

A witness outside the bank described the blue van the men were driving, and police spotted the van within minutes. As the van turned into Interstate 80, a state trooper joined in the chase.

The van stopped suddenly on the freeway.

``The driver of the vehicle, identified as Charles Simmons, exited the vehicle and advanced on officers, displaying a weapon in a threatening manner,'' Hobart said. ``At the same time Paul Simmons, who was still in the vehicle, pointed his weapon at officers.''

All three officers opened fire.

Police Officers Dennis Vinson and Chad Krull and state Trooper Dennis McMahon were placed on routine administrative leave pending an investigation into the shooting.
