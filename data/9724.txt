Dale County, Ala. (WSFA) -- A 25-year-old Ozark man is dead after he crashed his vehicle trying to elude Dale County Sheriff's deputies, according to a news release from the Alabama State Troopers.

Michael Donald Kroger drove his 1999 Mitsubishi Mirage off the road and hit a tree about 12 miles north of Ozark on Alabama 105 after leading authorities on a high-speed chase.

The chase started at about 10:15 Tuesday night on Alabama 123 and continued along Dale County 18 before ending on Alabama 105, Troopers said.

Kroger had several active warrants, according to Dale County Sheriff's Office and Ozark police, and he fled the scene in the Mitsubishi when law enforcement officers confronted him about those warrants at a business in Ozark.

After the crash Kroger was taken to Dale Medical Center with serious injuries and doctors pronounced him dead at 11:45 p.m.

State Troopers continue to investigate.
