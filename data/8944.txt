Steven Washington, a 27-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police officers Saturday, March 20, in the 800 block of South Vermont Avenue in Koreatown, according to authorities.

Los Angeles police officials said officers shot Washington early Saturday morning after he reached into his waistband for what they believed was a weapon.

Washington died from a single gunshot wound to the head shortly after midnight.

Although no weapon was found, officers said they feared for their lives because Washington did not respond to their commands and appeared to be reaching for his waistband.

Hours after the shooting, Washington's relatives criticized police and said the dead man had suffered from learning disabilities and was generally afraid of strangers. They insisted that he was not violent and that he probably had been walking home after visiting a friend.

Police identified the gang enforcement officers involved as Allan Corrales and George Diego, who have served nearly seven and eight years with the department, respectively. Both have been reassigned until the probe is completed, police say.
