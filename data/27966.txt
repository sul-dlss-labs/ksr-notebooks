SAN JOSE (CBS SF) -- A knife attack that left one man dead early Sunday led to the fatal officer-involved shooting of the suspect in a violent confrontation near a homeless encampment in San Jose, authorities said.

Officers responded to calls of a person being stabbed in the area of N. Autumn Street and Julian Street in San Jose, north of SAP Center, shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday.

Officers arrived at the intersection, which is near a homeless encampment along the Guadalupe River Trail, and found a man suffering multiple stab wounds. A man holding a knife nearby refused to comply when officers commanded him to drop the knife. At that point, one officer used a "less than lethal" weapon on the suspect "without effect," according to a statement released by the police department Sunday afternoon.

The stabbing suspect then turned and advanced toward officers who opened fire, killing him. The victim of the stabbing attack also died of his wounds at the scene.

No officers were injured and they will be placed on routine paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated.

The officers' body worn cameras were activated during the incident.

The Santa Clara County District Attorney's Office and the San Jose Police Department's Homicide Unit are conducting a joint criminal investigation. The San Jose Police Department's Internal Affairs Unit, the San Jose City Attorney's Office and the Office of the Independent Police Auditor also are monitoring the case.
