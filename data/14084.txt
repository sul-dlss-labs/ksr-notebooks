SEATTLE — A homicide suspect who was shot after he pointed a gun at police in Mukilteo on Feb. 16 has died from his injuries, officials said Tuesday.

Riley Leif Ottersen, 34, was under investigation for a double shooting on Camano Island. He allegedly led police on a high-speed chase into south Snohomish County and leveled a gun at officers before being fired upon himself. Ottersen was in a Seattle hospital. He died over the weekend, Island County detectives said.

One of the people Ottersen shot on Camano Island, Bret Berlin, 44, died earlier this month. A second person shot on the island suffered less serious injuries.

The officer-involved shooting in Mukilteo remains under investigation by the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team, said Mark Marsh, an agency spokesman and Edmonds police sergeant. The team includes detectives from around the county who probe cases where police use potentially fatal force.

Berlin’s death had been the subject of a homicide investigation by the Island County Sheriff’s Office. That investigation is ongoing, detective Ed Wallace said Tuesday.

The Island County undersheriff previously said investigators were unable to interview Ottersen due to his grave medical condition.
