MENASHA - The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Friday identified the man shot and killed by a Neenah police officer while executing a search warrant Tuesday afternoon as 43-year-old Shawn D. Blowers of Menasha.

Neenah and Menasha police were executing the warrant, which was related to a possible internet crime against children, in the 900 block of Tayco Street when Blowers confronted officers with a knife, according to the DOJ.

A Neenah police officer, identified by the DOJ as Christopher Gorden, shot Blowers. Authorities performed life-saving measures and took Blowers to ThedaCare Regional Medical Center-Neenah, where he later died.

Gorden, a Neenah police investigator, has been in law enforcement for 11 years. He has been placed on administrative leave per department policy.

The DOJ's Division of Criminal Investigation will continue investigating the incident, with assistance of the Wisconsin State Patrol and the DOJ's Office of Crime Victim Services, according to a news release issued late Friday afternoon.

The Winnebago County District Attorney's Office will receive the DOJ report once the investigation concludes.

All law enforcement involved are "fully cooperating" during the investigation, the release said.
