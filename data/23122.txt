Bryan Paul Causey, 33, was shot when he attempted to flee and officers said he attempted to run them down.

The incident began Wednesday afternoon at a home in a subdivision near the Wood County Airport, where officers say they bought methamphetamine from Causey, who they believed had an automatic weapon.

Undercover officers and uniformed officers said they attempted to arrest Causey as he drove away in a pickup truck. He reportedly tried to drive around the officers and ran into a ditch, but then a woman jumped out of the truck and then Causey drove out of the ditch heading toward the some of the officers.

An officer fired one shot at him, hitting him. Causey drove onto state Route 31 toward Williamstown, hitting several vehicles and injuring two other motorist, running off the road. He died at the scene.
