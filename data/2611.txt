Police say they've found the body of a man who apparently drowned while fleeing from police just days ago. Authorities say the body was that of 27-year-old Mario Dee Jackson. Jackson and another man reportedly were conducting a drug deal but fled the scene before officers even arrived.

They didn't get very far -- 29-year-old Delano Caldwell was arrested, and Jackson drowned. HIs body was found Friday when some motorist saw his body floating in a creek on Wares Ferry Road.

Also Friday, police in Andalusia are investigating the discovery of a body there. Investigators say the body already is so decomposed they can't tell if it was a man or a woman.
