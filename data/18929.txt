(Greenwood-AP) June 10, 2006 - A 23-year-old Greenwood woman has died shortly after she was arrested on drug charges.

Greenwood County deputies say they took Shatica Fuller into custody Thursday after buying an ounce of cocaine from her.

At the jail, a small, partially chewed plastic bag of white powder was found in Fuller's mouth. She spit it out. But authorities say that before Fuller could be checked out by a nurse, her heart stopped and she collapsed.

She died two hours later at the hospital.

Deputies think the substance was cocaine, but investigators will have to wait for test results to determine exactly what it was.

The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating the death.
