CLARKSVILLE, Tenn. (CLARKSVILLENOW) -Special Agents with thte Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting that occurred Saturday morning in Clarksville.

Around 9:45 a.m., officers with the Clarksville Police Department responded to a vehicle crash on Britton Springs Rd. Witnesses reported seeing a man and woman walking away from the crash, and officers found two people in that area matching the description given by the witnesses.

TBI said that as officers approached the two, the man fled on foot, in the area of the 1900 block of Batts Lane. One of the officers pursued him while the other officer stayed with the female.

After an encounter between the man identified as 29-year-old Angel Burke, who was armed with a handgun, and the officer who was pursuing him, the officer fired at Burke, striking him. Burke was pronounced deceased at a Clarksville hospital.

No law enforcement officers were injured in the incident.

This remains an active and ongoing investigation, as TBI Special Agents continue to work to gather any and all relevant interviews and evidence. As in any case, TBI’s investigative findings will be shared with the District Attorney General throughout the process for his consideration and review.

“As is our policy, the TBI does not identify the officers involved in these types of incidents and instead refers questions of that nature to their respective department,” TBI said in a statement.

Clarksville police are currently referring questions to TBI.
