MOBILE, Alabama -- Police have identified the man killed while trying to flee from police in a reportedly stolen car as 36-year-old Kenneth Lamar Bedgood.

Bedgood, whose last known address was in Eight Mile, opened fire on officers before they shot at him, said Cpl. Christopher Levy, public information officer for the Mobile Police Department.

He was killed at Montlimar Apartments on Azalea Road, approximately one block from the area where police found the body of Gary Demetrius House Tuesday morning.

Police could not say whether the two cases are related. However, Chief Micheal T. Williams said the Acura Integra Bedgood was driving in matches the description of a car which police were looking for in relation to the House case.

Williams said he has not personally run the car's vehicle identification number or its license plate to determine with any certainty that the car was the one police sought.

Mobile police were called to assist Prichard officers who were chasing a car driven by Bedgood, which had been reported stolen, Levy said. The chased moved into Mobile city limits and ended in front of Montlimar Apartments.

Anyone with information on the man or the case can call MPD at 251-208-7211.
