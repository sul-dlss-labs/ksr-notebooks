An attempted traffic stop in Brundidge ended in a fatal wreck in Dale County Tuesday night.

According to Alabama State Troopers, Bradley Thompson, 25, was killed when the 1989 Ford Ranger that he was driving left the roadway and overturned.

The crash happened about 9 p.m. at the 56-mile marker on U.S. Highway 231, eight miles north of Ozark, according to Troopers.

Thompson wasnâ€™t wearing a seat belt and was ejected, Troopers reported.

According to Brundidge Police Chief Moses Davenport, Thompson failed to stop for officers after a traffic violation. From that point on, Alabama State Troopers and the Ozark Police Department became aware that Thompson was headed toward Ozark and was fleeing from police.

No further information is available at this time as Troopers continue to investigate the crash.
