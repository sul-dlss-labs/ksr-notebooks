The male suspect involved in Friday morning’s officer-involved shooting has been identified 38-year-old Ronald Barawis of Kailua-Kona.

Barawis was shot during an incident that began Friday morning at about 12:20 a.m. in the drive-thru of the McDonald’s restaurant in the Puainako Town Center in Hilo.

Officers initially located Barawis driving during an investigation into the possible sighting of a wanted fugitive. Authorities commanded that he exit the vehicle. Instead of obeying the officers’ commands, Barawis drove over barriers in the drive-thru, accelerated his vehicle and drove towards an officer, ramming into two police vehicles.

HPD reports that officers discharged their firearms at the vehicle accelerating towards the officer. Bullets reportedly struck the suspect, resulting in his fatality; and a 28-year-old female passenger. The passenger was transported to Queen’s Medical Center on Oahu, where she is in critical but stable condition.

The identity of the woman has not been released, as she has not been arrested. Authorities say she is from Mountain View.

According to police, a shotgun, assault-type rifle, and two semi-automatic handguns were observed within Barawis’ reach in the vehicle he was operating. In addition, an item that appeared to be a bulletproof-type vest was viewed on the backrest of the driver’s seat.
