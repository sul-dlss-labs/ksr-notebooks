Myrtle Beach, SC - MYRTLE BEACH, SC (WMBF) - A Myrtle Beach man has been charged with killing a 14-year-old in a car accident on McCormick Road on April 13.

The South Carolina Highway Patrol charged Miguel Angel Murillo, 18, with reckless homicide, operating an uninsured motor vehicle, according to the South Carolina Highway Patrol. Murillo was booked into J. Reuben Long at 1:47 a.m. Tuesday.

Later Tuesday, Horry County Police charged Murillo with failure to stop for blue lights/siren resulting in death, and improper turn signal, which sparked the chase that ended in the death of a passenger in Murillo's car, Lucero Sanchez Martinez.

According to HCPD, an officer attempted to pull Murillo's Mitsubishi Galant over for failure to use his signal near a Highway 814. According to a report, the officer chased the car down Forestbrook Road until Murillo made a hard right-hand turn onto McCormick Road, where he tried to pass a car and collided head-on with a black SUV just after 11:15 a.m.

Horry County Coroner Robert Edge said Martinez died about 45 minutes later at Conway Medical Center.

A judge did not grant bond for Murillo during a Tuesday afternoon hearing in Myrtle Beach.
