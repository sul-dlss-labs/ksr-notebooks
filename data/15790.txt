A man is dead after an altercation with Oklahoma City police on Sunday night.

Police said they responded to a disturbance call about 7 p.m. at the Meadow Creek Apartments on SW 59th Street, where a man was breaking things and “literally fighting with the air,” OKC Police Sgt. Gary Knight said.

Knight said when officers arrived, the man began physically assaulting them. Police used Tasers on the man, and while they were trying to take him into custody, he stopped breathing, Knight said.

EMSA medics tried to resuscitate him, but he was pronounced dead at the hospital.

The man's identity has not been released.

The medical examiner will rule on cause of death.
