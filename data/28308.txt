He fled, and law enforcement set up a perimeter and a K-9 unit was used to track him to a shed behind a residence. Officers then heard what sounded like a gunshot coming from inside the shed.

Officers provided medical care on the scene and Johnson was transported by Mayo Clinic Ambulance to the CentraCare-St. Cloud Hospital, where he later died.

Law enforcement officers did not discharge their weapons, according to the news release. A handgun was recovered at the scene.
