Miami â€“ A fatal police-involved shooting in Miami is under investigation after officers said they were forced to fire.

Miami police said they were called to a domestic violence incident Sunday at a home in the area of Southwest Third Street in Little Havana. When officers arrived, a woman was discovered with several lacerations to her body.

The victim's neighbor, David Bover, told Local 10 News that the woman ran to his apartment after her lover of 12 years attacked her.

"She (came) running to my house looking for help," Bover said. "I hear, 'Help me. Help me. Help me.' At that moment (she opened) my door (and) enter(ed)."

Bover said the suspect, identified by family members as Carlos Yero, 59, was close behind the victim, holding a handgun in one hand and a piece of a table in the other.

Bover said he grabbed Yero in a bear hug and pushed him out of the door.

According to detectives, Yero drove off in his SUV, but returned to his home minutes later and tried to go inside.

Police said Yero was unable to get in and pointed his gun at police. After failing to comply with officers to drop his gun, police said they were forced to fire.

Yero was later pronounced dead at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

The victim was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital for her injuries and is expected to recover.

"I think that he wanted to kill her," Bover said. "If I (wasn't) here, you never know."

The four officers involved in the shooting are off duty until the investigation is concluded.
