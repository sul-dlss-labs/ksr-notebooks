Advertiser Staff

 Oct. 7, 2000: After drinking at two locations, Clyde Arakawa, an off-duty Honolulu police officer, is involved in a collision with Hale'iwa resident Dana Ambrose, 19, at the intersection of Pali Highway and School Street. Ambrose is killed. Ambrose was on her way home from her job as a waitress at the Brew Moon Restaurant & Micro Brewery.

 Oct. 11, 2000: Honolulu Police Chief Lee Donohue acknowledges that police officers gave special "courtesies" to Arakawa after KHON television news broadcast video of Arakawa walking freely around the collision scene and an officer putting his arm briefly around Arakawa. The police union notifies a lawyer, who goes to the crash scene.

 Oct. 31, 2000: Arakawa retires from the police force and moves to Oregon.

 Nov. 1, 2000: Ambrose's parents, Rod and Susan, sue Arakawa and two restaurants they say served Arakawa liquor before the accident. Tropic's Diner on Auahi Street and the Side Street Inn on Hopaka Street later settle out of court. The terms were not disclosed. The suit against Arakawa is pending.

 April 16, 2001: The O'ahu grand jury indicts Arakawa on a charge of manslaughter. He is accused of killing Ambrose by driving recklessly and drunk. Arakawa later says he's not responsible for the death and pleads not guilty.

 Aug. 3, 2001: Circuit Court Judge Sabrina McKenna throws out Arakawa's counterclaim to the lawsuit by Ambrose's parents. Arakawa had wanted Ambrose's insurance company to pay for the damage to his car.

 Jan. 25, 2002: It is disclosed that police officers have been either suspended or demoted for their involvement in the investigation of the collision. According to the police union, six officers were disciplined. Honolulu Police Chief Lee Donohue declines to answer questions about the officers, citing the collective bargaining agreement with the union, but says the officers do not face any criminal prosecution.

 Jan. 29, 2002: The Arakawa trial opens. City prosecutor Peter Carlisle, who personally handled the case, presents witnesses and experts who say that Arakawa had been drinking and ran a red light and was speeding. Arakawa does not testify, but an expert testifies Arakawa wasn't drunk because he was an "experienced drinker" who had a "practiced liver" that could filter alcohol from his body faster than normal. Arakawa's defense also said Ambrose was speeding and ran the red light.

 Feb. 19, 2002: The jury convicts Arakawa of manslaughter.
