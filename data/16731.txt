RIALTO, Calif. (KABC) -- A suspect was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Rialto Friday afternoon, according to authorities.

Rialto police responded to a domestic disturbance call from a woman regarding her boyfriend at an apartment complex in the 200 block of South Linden Avenue at about 3:12 p.m.

When they arrived, police said they located a man who was combative, and a struggle ensued.

Officers used a Taser on the suspect, which was ineffective. That's when he pulled out a knife, and an officer shot him in the chest, authorities said.

The suspect was transported to Arrowhead Regional Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. He was not immediately identified, but police said he was a confirmed gang member on probation and had an extensive criminal history.

The officers were said to be in good condition, as was the domestic violence victim.

The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department was investigating the incident.
