HOUSTON â€” A Houston police officer shot a suspect to death Thursday night in north Houston.

According to Houston police, officers responded to reports of criminal mischief in progress at an apartment complex at Goodson and Airline, in the Greenspoint area.

Preliminary reports from police said a woman called the police and said her brother was inside her home with a weapon and was destroying things.

As two officers were en route to the scene they received more information from dispatch that the woman's brother had a weapon, according to police.

Officers made it to the apartment complex and police said they knocked on the door and waited for the door to open. Police said as soon as the door opened the suspect walked in the doorway and immediately pointed a gun at the officers.

That's when the officers pulled out their guns and shot at the suspect several times, officials said.

The suspect, only identified as a 20-year-old Hispanic man, was shot and died on scene.

The two officers were uninjured in this incident. They have been placed on administrative leave as the investigation continues.

Police said at this time it is undetermined if the suspect ever fired his gun at the officers.

In addition to the woman, there were also two children inside the apartment at the time of the shooting. None of them were injured.

This investigation is ongoing.
