From Times Staff Reports

Three suspects pleaded not guilty Monday to charges stemming from a robbery and car chase in which a teenager was shot to death by police.

The two boys from Pico Rivera, one 15 and the other 17, were charged with assault with a deadly weapon and firing at an occupied vehicle.

Because of their ages, their names were not released.

A third suspect, Richard Rafael Gutierrez, 21, also of Pico Rivera, is charged with two counts of robbery and one count each of assault with a firearm, shooting at an occupied vehicle and evading police.

The fourth suspect, Michael Bilderrain, 18 of Pico Rivera, was shot to death last week when he allegedly pointed a gun at a California Highway Patrol officer who had stopped their car in the San Fernando Valley. Police chased the car after a robbery at a public storage facility in South Gate.
