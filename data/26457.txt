OGDEN — Police have identified a man who died after being shot by four Ogden police officers on Friday evening.

Jovany Mercado-Bedolla, 26, died about 9 p.m. Friday after four police officers shot at him near the intersection of 31st Street and Gramercy Avenue, according to a news release from Ogden Police Lt. Michael Boone.

Police say the man was wielding a knife and approached a group of people near 32nd Street and Gramercy Avenue. The person who called police said the man, later identified as Mercado-Bedolla, appeared disoriented.

Four Ogden Police officers in three patrol cars arrived at the scene shortly after. When they approached Mercado-Bedolla, he showed the knife and ignored officers’ repeated orders to drop it, according to Boone.

He then started approaching the officers in a threatening manner, according to police. Eventually, when the officers could no longer retreat, all four fired at him, police said. Mercado-Bedolla was pronounced dead at the scene.

All the officers have been placed on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated, police said.

No other details about the shooting were released Monday. It is not clear how many shots were fired. There is body camera footage of the shooting that will be released in the future, police said.
