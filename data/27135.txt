SUMMARY:

On Tuesday, December 10, 2019, at 5:20 p.m. a caller reported that a vehicle crashed in front of her home in the 15000 block of Mojave Street in Hesperia. The driver exited the vehicle and chased her inside the home. The suspect armed himself with a baseball bat and the caller hid in another room. As the caller spoke with a 911 dispatcher, the suspect assaulted the caller’s elderly mother.



After hearing the crash and calls for help, neighbors came to help the victims. The suspect turned his attack toward an elderly, male neighbor and assaulted him with the bat.



Deputies arrived and made contact with the suspect, who was still armed with the baseball bat and a deputy involved shooting occurred. The suspect was pronounced deceased at the scene.



Two victims of the assault were airlifted with significant injuries. Their current condition is unknown.



Specialized Detectives responded to the scene to conduct the investigation. Detectives determined the suspect is not known to any of the residents of the home and this appears to be a random act of violence.



Riverside County Coroner will conduct the autopsy.



The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information, or anyone who witnessed the incident, is asked to contact Detective Simon Demuri, Specialized Investigations Division – Homicide Detail at (909)387-3589. Callers can remain anonymous and contact WeTip at 800-78CRIME or www.wetip.com.
