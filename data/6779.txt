WAVE 3 Investigator

BEDFORD, Ky. (WAVE) -- A 50-year-old man was shot and killed Saturday by two Kentucky state troopers responding to a domestic dispute. WAVE 3 Investigator Lindsay English has the details.

It started out as a domestic fight and ended with Darrell Corley dead after he refused to drop his weapon and Sgt. Howard Rice and Trooper Kyle Moffett opened fire.

Late into Saturday night, the lights of police cars and investigators spotlighted part of Thornhill Street in the quiet, wooded subdivision in Trimble County. Earlier in the day, neighbors got a visit from Kentucky State Troopers.

"He said someone was in the neighborhood and he was wearing a green shirt and a had a knife," said Josh Bentley, who lives just up the road from the crime scene. "He asked me to lock my doors to make sure I was safe.

The man they were looking for was Corley. Kentucky State Trooper Ron Turley says Corley's wife, who had a restraining order against him, called 911 around 4 p.m. "The caller, female, advised her husband was there and threatening her."

By the time police arrived, Corley had taken off, and police tracked him down less than a mile from the home. But Turley says Corley would not surrender. "Mr. Corley had a knife on him, a large knife. He was asked repeatedly to drop the knife. After repeatedly asking him to drop the knife, he lunged at them. They fired their weapons."

Corley was pronounced dead at the scene.

The two troopers both work out of the Campbellsburg post. They have been placed on administrative, pending the outcome of the investigation. Sgt. Rice is a 9-year KSP veteran and Trooper Kyle Moffett has been with KSP for two years.
