Police Monday said they tried more than 100 times to persuade a Prospect Heights man to surrender before a fatal confrontation early Sunday.

William Howard, 37, died of multiple gunshot wounds in an exchange of bullets that ended an eight-hour standoff at his Cove Drive condominium, according to police and the Cook County medical examiner's office.

While prosecutors and the Illinois State Police investigated whether the shooting was justified, Prospect Heights Police Chief Bruce Morris on Monday detailed a "graduated sequence" of efforts to get Howard to come out, starting with phone calls and moving on to a bullhorn, pepper spray, tear gas, and a conversation through a bedroom closet door.

But one of Howard's brothers asked why police didn't ask family members to help, and why an encounter that started with a misdemeanor warrant ended in death.

"The boy never done anything wrong in his life," said the brother, who would not give his name.

Howard was awaiting trial on charges of battery and resisting arrest.

After he allegedly missed a court date, police were sent to arrest him Saturday night.

After identifying themselves, they heard a shot inside the house, Morris said. Howard then told the officers he was armed and wouldn't come out, and the standoff began, the chief said.

"These types of situations are governed by the tenor of the person who's inside the apartment," Morris said.
