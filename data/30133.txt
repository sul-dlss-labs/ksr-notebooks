The Mercedes eventually crashed into multiple light poles and a fire hydrant and overturned in the 4600 block of Hallandale Beach Boulevard around 9 p.m.

Witnesses said the car erupted in flames after flipping over.

"He hit the poles and he flip out three times and then it went on fire," witness Camille Moustardy said. "We were outside and tried to close the door to close the business. After that I saw someone flipped inside the car."
