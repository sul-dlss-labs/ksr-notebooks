EL RENO — Five Canadian County officers who opened fire and killed a suspected vehicle thief in October went back to work Friday after being cleared in the shooting.

On Friday, Kingfisher County District Attorney Mike Fields ruled that the Oct. 8 shooting of Alexander G. Lindahl was justified and that he saw no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the officers.

Authorities said Lindahl, 24, was shot after crashing a stolen pickup along U.S. 81 near Okarche and exiting the vehicle armed with a handgun.

Canadian County Sheriff Chris West said Lindahl was driving a vehicle reported stolen from Oklahoma City, which he abandoned near a Braum’s dairy farm in Grady County. He then reportedly stole a pickup from the business and was later spotted by law enforcement and fled.
