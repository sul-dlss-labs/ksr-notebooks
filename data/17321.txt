Four East Baton Rouge sheriff's deputies who fatally shot 48-year-old Travis Stevenson in his car during a February confrontation in Old South Baton Rouge were justified in opening fire and acted in self-defense, East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney Hillar Moore III announced Thursday.

Stevenson was struck seven times in the head, neck and shoulders after repeatedly reversing his Cadillac sedan into a Sheriff's Office SUV, which had blocked him in at a gravel parking spot off Scott Street just before 10 p.m. on Feb. 23.

“The actions of the sheriff’s deputies were warranted and justified,” Moore said of the decision of four of the six deputies present to open fire. The deputies fired more than 20 rounds during the incident, including several aimed at Stevenson's rear tires in an unsuccessful bid to disable the car.
