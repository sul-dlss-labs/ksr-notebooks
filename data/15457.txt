David Scott Wear, a 42-year-old white man, was fatally shot by two Los Angeles police officers Dec. 5 in the 6000 block of Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 6:45 p.m., officers responded to a call of an assault with a deadly weapon near the busy intersection of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue. When police arrived, they were directed to Wear, who was holding a knife and swinging it at pedestrians, according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department.

Officers ordered Wear to drop the knife, and he refused, prompting two officers to fire multiple rounds, striking the man in the upper torso. People in the area scattered amid the gunfire.

Wear was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:31 p.m., according to coroner’s records. A knife was recovered at the scene. The LAPD posted a photo of the weapon, a 3- to 4-inch folding knife, on Twitter that night.

"All I heard is just a bunch of gunshots; it sounded like a rifle. I thought I was about to get caught up in a shootout. Everyone was scattered. And then I realized there were police. They were posted up over a man that was lying on the ground bleeding," witness Jordan White told KABC-TV Channel 7.

Anyone with information is asked to call the LAPD’s Force Investigation Division at (213) 486-5230. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
