SAGINAW, MI -- China Daily is still stunned that her older brother died by suicide after a standoff with police in Saginaw.

"That is the last thing we would've expected for him," she said while trying to hold back tears on Tuesday, Oct. 2.

Her brother died over the weekend. Police said he died by suicide after being barricaded for hours inside a house on the city's West Side.

He is identified as 37-year-old Joseph O. Redeemer.

Redeemer entered a home at 521 S. Webster near Lyon after fleeing police on foot following a traffic stop.

According to Saginaw Police Chief Bob Ruth, city police conducted a traffic stop on Lyon and South Granger about 12:50 a.m. on Saturday, Sept. 29.

After a shootout with police during a chase in which no one was injured, Redeemer barricaded himself in the home after midnight. The incident ended about 10 a.m. when police entered the home to confront Redeemer and he died of a self-inflicted wound.

"I'm devastated," Daily said. "My brother was a good person. He had a lot of people in his life that adored him."

Daily said that her brother made mistakes in his life, but they don't define the person he was.

"He was really just trying to find his way in life," she said.

Redeemer was facing a drug charge in Bay City and had served time in prison for robbery.

"We never thought less of him regardless of the mistakes he made," Daily said.

A Go Fund Me account titled Joseph O Redeemer's Homegoing has raised more than $1,500 of a $5,000 goal to help pay funeral costs. Daily said she created the page.

Daily said her brother was a loving father, brother, uncle and son.

Funeral arrangements are pending.

The incident remains under investigation by Michigan State Police.
