This weekend, the manhunt for Michael Arangio, wanted for murdering three Colorado Springs teens , brought police to a Whistler Point apartment -- and after a standoff of several hours, Arangio had apparently taken his own life.

Afterward, a memorial for his alleged victims was vandalized.

According to the Colorado Springs Gazette, Arangio's parents told authorities he could be found in the aforementioned apartment, located in the Resort at University Park. The SWAT team rolled in at around 11:30 a.m., prompting evacuation of the building and closures of nearby streets.

Amid the hours of negotiations that followed, cops fired tear gas canisters into the apartment, but Arangio didn't emerge. Finally, about four hours after the confrontation began, a police department robot entered the apartment. Shortly thereafter, Arangio was confirmed dead.

Loved ones of the victims expressed relief amid their still fresh grief, with at least one observer declaring that Arangio had taken the "chicken way out." If so, he wasn't the only member of the poultry family in the area. KRDO-TV reports that a makeshift memorial for brothers Aaron and Wayne Fix, as well as Austin Howse, a longtime friend of Aaron's, was vandalized. Specifically, photos of the Fix brothers were stolen -- no doubt compounding the agony already being felt by those they left behind.
