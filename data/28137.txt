WILBURTON, Okla. (AP) — A southeastern Oklahoma police officer fatally shot a knife-wielding man who attacked and stabbed him, the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said Thursday.

The OSBI said Wilburton Officer Richard Johnston was investigating a report of an intoxicated man walking along a roadway when he encountered Alexander Scott, 30, at about 8 p.m. Wednesday in the city about 130 miles (209 kilometers) southeast of Oklahoma City.

The agency said in a news release that Scott threw a bottle at Johnston’s patrol car, then stabbed the officer in the neck and shoulder as he exited the car.

Johnston then opened fire, killing Scott at the scene, the OSBI said.

Johnston was taken to a McAlester hospital where he was treated and released, according to the OSBI.
