CHICO — The Butte County Coroner’s Office identified the man who died in a motorcycle wreck Sunday who Chico police say was trying to escape from an officer at the time of the crash.

Thomas Phelan, 37, of Chico, died in the crash, the Coroner’s Office said Tuesday.

Phelan had identification on him at the site of the wreck, however the Chico Police Department temporary withheld the rider’s name pending notification of next of kin.

The crash occurred at roughly 10:40 p.m. Sunday near 2100 Notre Dame Blvd., approximately 0.7 miles north of the Skyway in Chico. The Police Department said in a press release an officer attempted to stop a motorcycle for having an unreadable license plate and the rider slowed briefly before accelerating away from the officer’s car.

After the officer chose not to directly pursue to the motorcyclist to avoid putting the public at risk, the officer found the crashed motorcycle and the deceased motorcyclist crashed into a pickup parked in a driveway. The Chico Police Major Accident Investigation Team determined the motorcycle crashed into the parked pickup.

The Chico Police Department is asking anyone who may have seen the collision or anyone with home security cameras which may have witnessed the incident to contact the Chico Police Traffic Division at 877-4970.
