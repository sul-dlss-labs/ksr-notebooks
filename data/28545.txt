In body camera footage released to media, Smith can be heard saying he can't breathe shortly after his arrest.

Shortness of breath is one symptom of both an enlarged heart and sickle cell crisis, according to the Mayo Clinic.

AMR was called nine minutes after Smith was in custody and complaining of pain.

At one point, Smith tells the sergeant he has asthma, and the sergeant says that's another reason he shouldn't have run from officers. At one point officers help sit Smith up after he asks to sit up.

When AMR arrived nine minutes after they were called, the EMT checked Smith's breathing and said, "alright, no asthma problem" before getting the gurney and loading Smith on with the help of officers.

At 6:35 p.m., 30 minutes after he was first apprehended by police, Smith stopped breathing, police said.

Winsett said AMR and EPD personnel attempted life-saving measures, and Evansville Fire officials arrived on scene and also assisted in life-saving measures. Smith was transported to Deaconess Hospital where he was pronounced dead.
