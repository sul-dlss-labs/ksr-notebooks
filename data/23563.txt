LANCASTER COUNTY, Va. — One man was killed and another driver remains hospitalized after a head-on crash following a pursuit with speeds topping 90 mph in Lancaster County Saturday night.

Sgt. Keeli L. Hill with Virginia State Police said Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office deputies and troopers were conducting a “checking detail” just after 9:35 p.m. on Route 3 near Route 605.

“The state police preliminary investigation reveals a silver 1998 Honda Accord driven by, David Wayne Walton, 45, of West Point, Va., approached the checking detail and stopped for the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Deputy,” Hill said.

Officials said that while a deputy was checking the status of Walton’s license, which was suspended, the driver sped off.

Deputies pursued the suspect, who officials said was traveling in excess of 90 mph in a 35 mph zone, for about two miles.

But officials said when Walton came to the intersection of Route 3 and Route 600, he struck an Acura sedan trying to make a left onto Route 3.

The driver of the Acura, a 61-year-old woman from Lancaster, was med-flighted to VCU Medical Center with serious injuries.

Walton died at the scene.

Troopers said alcohol is being considered a factor in the crash, which remains under investigation.
