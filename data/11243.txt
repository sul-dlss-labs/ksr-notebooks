AUBURN, Ga. â€” The suspect in a double shooting in Barrow County shot himself after fleeing the scene Monday afternoon and is in "bad shape," police said.



The initial shooting happened at a home on Parks Mill Road in Auburn. A neighbor heard arguing and called police, Auburn Police Chief Paul Nadeau said. Police said Zaid Omar shot his girlfriend and another woman in an apparent domestic dispute.



The victims were flown to the hospital with critical injuries. One of the women has since died, but police did not say which one. Their names are being held pending next of kin notification.



News Chopper 2 flew over the scene around 3:15 p.m. as officers combed an outdoor stairwell for clues.



In Gwinnett County, Suwanee police officers surrounded a home on Scales Road where the gunman was believed to be barricaded. Several roads in the neighborhood were shut down because of the SWAT standoff.



"I was worried because my two babies were inside the house," neighbor Emily Henderson said.



Henderson said her family was trapped in the house during the ordeal



Suwanee police Capt. Clyde Byers said the suspect was armed inside his house and had threatened to kill himself.



"From what I understand, also, his mother and brother were on the scene. I believe he came out into the front yard, held a gun to his head, and at that time, we kind of reached a standoff," Byers said.



Less than two hours after the standoff began, Suwanee police said Omar killed himself. Later, police issued a correction, saying he was "in bad shape" at the Gwinnett Medical Center. His family said he is on life support.



"And I just couldn't imagine if it was my child, what would happen. But I'm glad my family is safe. Still, I was concerned with their family," Henderson said.



The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is investigating the case.
