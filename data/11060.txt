At around 4:30 p.m. Monday police reported the woman was involved in a traffic accident and fled the scene. Her SUV was spotted a short time later by the Woodland police chief, who started to follow it. He abandoned the chase though after the SUV accelerated to 90 mph and became too dangerous to pursue.

A short time later, the SUV apparently lost control and left the road, turned sideways and hit a tree in the front yard of a home at 1617 College St. Deltoro was trapped inside the vehicle.

The Sacramento County Coroner says autopsy results on Deltoro should be available on Wednesday.
