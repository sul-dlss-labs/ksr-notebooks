BRIDGETON -- A man fleeing police was killed Friday night after crashing into a utility pole, according to authorities.

Police identified the driver as Devonte Brooks, 21, of Millville, who was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after New Jersey State Police broke off a chase with him.

The Bridgeton Police Department issued a bulletin Friday for police to be on the lookout for a Lincoln Continental involved in a crash earlier that evening where the car struck a police officer and drove off, according to a press release issued by New Jersey State Police and the state Attorney General's Office.

A New Jersey State Police trooper was in the area of Route 49 and South West Avenue around 9 p.m. when the trooper spotted a car matching the description, the release said.

The trooper tired to stop the Lincoln but the car did not stop, which led to a short pursuit, according to State Police. The pursuit ended when the trooper lost sight of the Lincoln, the release said.

Bridgeton police reported to State Police a short time later that the car was found crashed into a utility pole on Route 49 east near milepost 25.7. According to State Police, the driver was traveling fast and attempting to turn when it ran off the road and slammed into the utility pole.

According to Bridgeton police Chief Michael Gaimari, the officer allegedly struck earlier by Brooks was treated for minor injuries and later released.

The fatal crash is under investigation by the New Jersey State Police and Cumberland County Prosecutor's Office.
