GULFPORT, MS (WLOX) - It was a day that left employees at the Goodwill store in the Norwood Shopping Plaza shaken up. Store manager Sue Rye says it all started Thursday morning when employees taking a smoke break were approached by a man.

"The gentlemen walked up to one of our employees and asked if he could use his cell phone, and he didn't have one," says Rye.

The man then asked the Goodwill employee to get another worker he described as a tall, pretty girl.

"She come out here, and he asked for her cell phone. She was handing him her cell phone, and he reached in his pocket and pulled a gun out. And said, 'I'm the man with the gun,'" says Rye.

Neither the store manager or police know if the man actually knew any of the employees. Rye says after the man showed the gun, workers immediately ran inside and called police.

"On arrival, the officer attempted to speak with the individual and a shot was fired by the individual and the officer," says Chief Alan Weatherford.

The officer was not hit, but the man was killed. He has been identified as 59-year-old Gayron L. Sanders of Gulfport.

Since the shooting involved a Gulfport officer, Chief Alan Weatherford says the Harrison County District Attorney's office and the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation are taking over the case.
