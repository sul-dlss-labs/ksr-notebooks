A Multnomah County grand jury has found no criminal wrongdoing by a Portland police officer who shot and killed a 52-year-old man in Southeast Portland last month.

Police were called to 98 S.E. 148th Ave. on Dec. 6 on a report of gunshots fired.

Resident Steven Wayne Liffel went in and out of his apartment with a firearm, police said. At one point, Liffel fired several shots and officers heard bullets whiz by, police said.

Later, Liffel emerged from the apartment carrying a rifle and moved away from the doorway, police said. A short time later, Officer Lawrence Keller shot and killed him.

Liffel died from a single gunshot wound to his pelvic area and subsequent internal bleeding, according to the state medical examiner.

Neighbors said Liffel had moved into the apartment on 148th Avenue at least six months to a year before the shooting. Public records show he was from Marysville, California, where he worked as a concrete mason.

The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office has released the grand jury transcript.
