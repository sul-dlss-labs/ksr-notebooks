ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – Bernalillo County deputies are naming two of the three people involved in a deadly crash that took place in southwest Albuquerque early Wednesday, January 29. The Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office says 18-year-old Carlos Hernandez was the driver in the incident.

Hernandez and another unidentified passenger were killed after crashing into another vehicle at the intersection of Sapphire Road and Unser Boulevard around 3:25 a.m. A third passenger has been identified as 21-year-old Angelic Colleen JoAnn McKeller who is at an area hospital.

Deputies say the vehicle was driving at a high rate of speed and in a reckless manner when the car crashed. BCSO reports that a deputy unsuccessfully tried to conduct a traffic stop and the offending vehicle was being pursued when it crashed.

Authorities say all three people inside the offending vehicle were either ejected or partially ejected from the car. Hernandez and another passenger were pronounced dead at the scene while McKeller was transported to a local hospital.

One person from the other vehicle that was involved in the crash was also taken to a hospital for examination. No BCSO personnel was injured in the incident.

Deputies closed all directions of traffic at the intersection of Unser and Arenal Wednesday morning so investigators could process the scene. The intersection has since reopened.
