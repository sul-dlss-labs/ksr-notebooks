A man who pulled a gun on officers dispatched to his home died from gunshot injuries.

Anson County Sheriff Landric Reid said his deputies were involved in a shooting incident with Bobby Rex Horne at 59 Lower White Store Road in Peachland on Friday, July 15. Bobby Horne’s daughter contacted Anson County 911 regarding him displaying slurred speech. Anson 911 then telephoned the Horne residence and spoke with Terina Horne, his wife, who was with him. EMS was dispatched to the residence.

Upon EMS arrival, Bobby Horne refused to be treated. Anson County Sheriffs’ Deputy Jonathan Hough and Anson County Lt. Timothy Watkins responded to the Horne residence at the request of EMS. Upon Watkins and Hough’s arrival, Bobby Horne retrieved a 308 rifle. As he raised the rifle toward Hough, Bobby Horne did not respond to deputy’s challenges to drop the weapon.

Hough then fired his service weapon at Horne, striking him. Watkins grabbed Terina Horne from the porch area and guided her away from the gun fire and behind cover.

Bobby Horne was transported to an area hospital where efforts to support his life were unsuccessful.

The State Bureau of Investigation Officer Involved Shooting Team responded to the scene at the sheriff’s request.
