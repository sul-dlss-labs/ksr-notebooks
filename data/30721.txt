HARTFORD, Vt. (WCAX) - Vermont State Police are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting in Hartford.

They say a white male in his 30′s was causing a disturbance, outside a home on Paula Street.

Police say they received the 911 call around 1:30 p.m. Thursday.

When the Hartford officer got there, we’re told he used pepper spray to try and get the man under control. But we’re told the man then pulled the officer to the ground, punched him in the head and began to strangle him.

That’s when police say the officer shot the man killing him.

State police detectives are interviewing witnesses and watching available video, including a body camera.

The officer has been put on administrative leave while VSP completes their investigation.
