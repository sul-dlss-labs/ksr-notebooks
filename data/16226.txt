Police say a man has died in a police-involved shooting in Hackensack, New Jersey.

Hackensack police responded to a 911 call for a domestic disturbance on the 100 block of Johnson Avenue at about 5 p.m., then encountered 22-year-old Raymond Peralta-Lantigua, who allegedly brandished a knife at one of the officers, according to Bergen County prosecutor John L. Molinelli.

Peralta-Lantigua was taken to a hospital, where he later died.

A knife was recovered outside the two-and-a-half story home where Peralta-Lantigua lived with his mother, according to a woman who identified herself as the man's sister to The Record. Michelle Peralta said he was unemployed but did not have other details on what led to the shooting.

There were no reports of officers being injured.

A neighbor who asked not to be identified said he heard arguing before police fired gunshots.

"I heard what sounded like a woman, maybe his mother, fighting where those guys are standing now, arguing and cursing, and the next thing I know is I see a guy lying on the ground," he said.

Chopper 4 over the scene showed heavy emergency response, including police, firefighters and EMS. The street was roped off to traffic as police investigated, and investigators could be seen examining a knife on the ground as bloody clothing lay a few feet away.

The shooting comes weeks after Elvin Diaz, 24-year-old man on probation, was fatally shot when he allegedly threatened cops with a meat cleaver in his Hackensack home. Days after that, police in nearby Lyndhurst fatally shot a knife-wielding man inside the public library.

Diaz's mother, Cecilia Diaz, appeared at the shooting scene on Johnson Avenue Thursday and told reporters, "I'm here because I want to know what happened over here with police."

"The way I feel right now, it's been only three weeks since that happened, how you think?" she said.
