Two female Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies fatally shot a man early Sunday during a confrontation outside an assisted living home, authorities said.

Deputies responded to a call that a man was threatening senior citizens at 1:30 a.m. at the home in the 16400 block of Woodruff Avenue in Bellflower.

The man was foaming at the mouth and refusing deputies' orders, officials said.

Two deputies were hurt when the man apparently hit one of them in the head, causing her to nearly black out, deputies said. The man also tried to grab the other deputy's gun.

The man pushed that deputy into a cement fountain. The impact was so strong that it broke the fountain in half, officials said.

An attempt by the deputies to stun the man with a Taser failed.

"He was definitely not complying with their initial commands," said Lt. Eddie Hernandez, of the LA County Sheriff's Department.

The man, whose identity was not immediately released, died at the scene. He was a resident at the home. A resident there said he was a 57-year-old Vietnam War veteran.

The deputies were not seriously hurt.

Anyone with any details regarding this shooting should contact the Sheriffâ€™s Headquarters Bureau at 323-267-4800.
