Correction: The name of the 17-year-old girl killed in the crash is Hannah Rawlings. Her last name was reported incorrectly in an earlier version.

Two teenagers are dead after they crashed their car into the French Broad River while speeding away from Sevier County sheriff's deputies, authorities said.

Two deputies on patrol in the Kodak area "tried to catch up with" the vehicle after they saw it speeding on Douglas Dam Road about 11 p.m. Tuesday, according to a news release from Sevier County Sheriff Ron Seals.

"Due to the speed of the vehicle the deputies were only able to make out the tail lights from the great distance," the release reads.

The deputies discovered the vehicle had crashed after they checked the area of Pollard Road and Pollard Cemetery Road to find debris and a damaged gate that led to the river, according to the release.

A spokeswoman for the Tennessee Highway Patrol, which is investigating the crash, said 19-year-old Aaron Baker of Sevierville and 17-year-old Hannah Rawlings of Knoxville were killed.

Autopsies will be performed to determine their causes of death.

A preliminary THP report identifies the vehicle as a 2006 Mitsubishi Galant. Baker was driving.

The spokeswoman, Lt. Stacey Heatherly, wrote in an email that the crash came after an attempt to "evade" deputies and said it was "not an active pursuit."

Further details were not released Wednesday.
