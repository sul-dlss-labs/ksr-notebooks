The Fremont Police Department is investigating a deadly shooting involving their officers Thursday night.

The incident happened just before 6:30 p.m. at a parking lot of the Hyatt Place Hotel near the 3100 block of West Warren Avenue.

The detectives involved in Thursday night's shooting are part of a newly formed firearms task force in the department.

"I came to the front of the truck and that's when I saw a lot of unmarked cars coming out of the parking spots,” she said. “And that's where I heard the shooting. And there were at least three shots I heard."

According to the Fremont police, the special firearms task force was trailing a man who they say had several felony warrants and may have been armed.

At some point, a pair of detectives approached the man and that’s when the situation became confrontational.

Fremont police said they even released a police dog in this situation.

"The sequence of events, I do know the K-9 was deployed before the shooting. At the time that the K-9 was deployed, that's when the suspect produced a firearm. And that's when the officers shot,” said Capt. Sean Washington with the Fremont Police Department.

The man did not survive his wounds and died on the scene. Police have not released the name of the suspect at this time.

This is the second fatal shooting involving a Fremont police officer in just eight days.

The first incident that happened last Tuesday on Highway 84, is still being investigated by the California Highway Patrol because it happened on a freeway
