Members of the U.S. Marshals Arizona WANTED Task Force fatally shot a man wanted for several crimes in California after he shot at law enforcement on Friday evening, officials said.

Task members attempted to apprehend the man, who had a warrant for a parole violation stemming from a violent assault and rape in California, near Buckeye Road and Sky Harbor Circle, the U.S. Marshals Service said.

The man, who had not been identified as of Saturday morning, was also wanted for a murder that happened earlier this month in Los Angeles, officials said.

Task force members attempted to arrest the man, who fired "multiple rounds" at law enforcement, officials said. They returned fire and struck him.

The man was taken into custody and life-saving measures were attempted, but he was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said.

No officers were injured during the shooting.

An investigation is ongoing.
