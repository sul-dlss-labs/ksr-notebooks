One man is dead after a truck ran off of highway 14 west of Nixa and crashed into James River.

According to the Christian County Coroner's office, the driver was identified as 19-year-old Brett Keeling.

Keeling was fleeing an officer after refusing to stop when the officer tried pulling it over for speeding.

The chase started just west of Billings around 6:00pm Wednesday night.

A Missouri State Highway Patrol dive team found the body and hooked the truck up so that it could be pulled out of the river.

Sheriff Cole said when emergency services arrived at the scene, they decided to postpone the diver team search until Thursday morning.

"Well we contacted the dive team and gave them the information that we had and we had to rely on their experience and their judgement on whether or not to dive last night or today.They decided today was the day to do that," said Sheriff Cole.
