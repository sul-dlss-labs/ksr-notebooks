RICHMOND HEIGHTS, Ohio -- A man threatening suicide wounded a police officer before being shot and killed at a home Sunday night.

Police Chief Gene Rowe said the wounded officer, a sergeant who has been with the department for 19 years, was in serious but stable condition Sunday night at Hillcrest Hospital.

The suspect, who has not been identified, was killed by another officer at the home at 4966 Geraldine Ave., located just west of Richmond Road near Richmond Town Square.

Rowe said four officers responded to the home at about 7 p.m. The suspect, who reportedly was alone in the home, allowed two officers inside and spoke with them.

The man agreed to leave with the officers to receive help at University Hospital Richmond Medical Center. He went to a room upstairs with the officers to get some clothes when he grabbed a handgun and shot the sergeant in the right side of his chest. The wounded officer was not wearing a bullet-proof vest, Rowe said.

The other officer returned fire and killed the suspect, Rowe said.

"It's always a dangerous situation," Rowe said. "The officers are trying to be prepared to do the best that they can for that person and at the same time try to make sure they're taking safety precautions."

Police were still at the scene late Sunday night. The Bureau of Crime Investigation also was at the scene to investigate the shooting. BCI Special Agent Supervisor Mark Kollar said officers were awaiting a search warrant for the home Sunday night.

Kollar said any information from the investigation will be turned over to the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.
