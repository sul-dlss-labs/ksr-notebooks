A Chicago police sergeant shot and killed a knife-wielding man Sunday afternoon after the man stabbed two people, one fatally, and struggled with another officer, an official said.

Police were called to a domestic disturbance about 1:40 p.m. in the 1100 block of West Pratt Boulevard on the Far North Side. When the two officers arrived, they found a woman lying in an apartment building's courtyard with severe stab wounds, said police spokesman Pat Camden.

Witnesses told them the attacker was in a first-floor apartment, and as emergency personnel attended to the woman, the officers entered the apartment. They found a man in a front bedroom, waving a knife, Camden said.

"Shoot me, just shoot me," Camden quoted the man as telling officers.

As the man came forward, the patrol officer tried to disarm him, Camden said.

In the struggle the sergeant fired once at the man, hitting him in the chest, Camden said.

The man, Howard Jones, 65, was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Evanston and was pronounced dead at 5:15 p.m., said a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office.

His wife, Bonnie Jones, 65, also taken to St. Francis, later died of her injuries, the medical examiner's spokesman said. Both lived at the Pratt address, according to the examiner's offfice.

Another stabbing victim, a man in his 30s believed to be the couple's son, was in good condition at the same hospital, Camden said.

Camden said police think the woman had a protection order against the man.

Police are investigating that and prior domestic problems between them.

He said doctors at St. Francis discovered that besides the gunshot, Howard Jones also had apparently self-inflicted stab wounds.
