A Montgomery County resident was killed in a crash Thursday morning in Perryville while reportedly fleeing a police officer, according to ABC 2 News.



Prem Suppogu, 41, died east of Jackson Station Road on US Route 40 after the 2008 Honda Civic he had been driving became wedged under a tractor trailer, the Cecil Whig reported.



The crash shut down Route 40 westbound at Jackson Station Road from 3:09 to 7:16 a.m., according to Maryland 511.



Suppogu crashed into the tractor trailer after leading police on a 15-mile chase from Route 40 in Elkton, where an officer attempted to stop him for speeding, according to The Whig.



During the investigation into Thursday morning's crash, a Maryland State Police cruiser was hit by a passing vehicle, according to the Community Fire Company of Perryville, which remained on the scene to assist.



That was in violation of the Move Over Law, which requires drivers to slow down and provide a lane of breathing room for emergency vehicles with their lights flashing.



Less than two weeks ago, a fire police officer was hit on Route 40 while directing traffic; he died Thursday morning, according to the fire company.



The intersection at Jackson Station Road has seen its share of fatalities in 2013.



A Perryville jogger was killed there on Jan. 29.



On Jan. 9, two highway workers were killed there when a North East man veered off the road, the Cecil Whig reported.
