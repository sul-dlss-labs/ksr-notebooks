Birmingham police are investigating the death of a man who died in police custody, authorities announced today.

Willie Maye, 43, died just before 1 a.m. Thursday after being taken to Cooper Green Hospital.

Maye was stopped by officers and detectives assigned to the Investigative Task Force in the West Precinct who were conducting checkpoints near Hibernian Street and Miles Avenue, police said.

When an officer approached Maye's vehicle and asked for his driver's license and proof of insurance, the officer smelled a strong odor of marijuana, said Birmingham police spokesman Lt. Henry Irby.

Maye fled in his vehicle and a chase followed. It ended at Bradford Street and Cherry Avenue, at which point Maye attempted to run away, Irby said.

A struggle began when officers, who called for backup, attempted to take Maye into custody. Maye was handcuffed and an officer used his Taser stun gun on the suspect.

Paramedics arrived and took Maye to Cooper Green Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead by hospital staff, Irby said.

Officers seized a large amount of marijuana in the trunk of Maye's vehicle.

The case remains under investigation.
