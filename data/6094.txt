Police killed a 23-year-old Whittier man Sunday night who they said pointed a gun at an officer chasing him.

Police responded to a report of a possible drug transaction about 11 p.m. at the corner of 4th Street and Mountain Avenue, and Christopher Michael Garcia fit the description of a suspect, said Ontario Police Det. Robert Freire.

Garcia tried to flee, then reached for a handgun in his waistband, officials said. One officer fired, striking Garcia once, Freire said.
