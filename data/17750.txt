Roanoke County police say a man apparently shot himself Monday night after he was approached by a county police officer in a county park.

A spokesman says the officer was conducting a routine patrol Monday night, when he approached a pickup truck parked near the soccer fields in Vinyard Park.

Police say a man in the truck pointed a gun at the officer and told him to go away.

The officer retreated and ordered the man to put down the gun, then heard a single gunshot.

The man was later found dead. Police believe he shot himself.

The officer did not fire his weapon, and no one else was injured.

Roanoke County Police say the man was 50-years-old, but they have not released his name.

At 9:30 p.m. Monday, Roanoke County Police were conducting a routine security check at Vinyard Park and came across two vehicles in the parking lot. The officer spoke to the two males in the first vehicle and moved on to the second vehicle, a pickup truck parked about 40-feet away. The officer observed a male inside the truck holding a handgun.
