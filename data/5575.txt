MONTGOMERY, Ala. - A Montgomery man died after officers took him into custody, the third jail death since August 27.

Lieutenant Ron Cook, a police spokesman, said 30-year-old Eddie Charles Ham Junior died Sunday morning.

Cook said officers were called to the front entrance of police headquarters about 5 a-m to calm Ham who was distraught at the time.

Police said Ham became aggressive with officers and refused to comply with their commands.

Cook said a Taser was used, but had little or no effect on Ham who was subdued a short time later and taken to the City Jail.

He said officers noticed Ham was unresponsive and he was transported to Baptist Medical Center South where he was pronounced dead.

His body was taken to the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences for an autopsy.

The case is being investigated by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation.
