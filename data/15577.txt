Cape and Islands District Attorney Michael O'Keefe told the Boston Globe that Gagne was "seriously impaired" when he was run over in Chatham early on New Year's Day. O'Keefe said Gagne had been drinking hard alcohol, but he declined to name the drugs. He said had drunk "hour after hour of alcohol" while going to bars and house parties.

The 22-year-old Gagne was a senior government major and lacrosse player at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York.

Authorities say Gagne was lying on an unlit street at about 4 a.m. Thursday when Chatham police officer Christopher Vardakis ran over him while responding to an emergency call.

Vardakis was placed on leave pending the investigation.
