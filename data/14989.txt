Phoenix Police Department SWAT team members fatally shot a 39-year-old man Saturday night after he pointed a handgun at an officer as they tried to apprehend him, police say.

Mauricio Herrera-Garcia fled the scene of an 8 p.m. accident near 4400 S. Sixth Avenue, department spokesman Sgt. Tommy Thompson said. Herrera-Garcia fired several shots into the air when the accident victim tried to contact him.

Police responded at about 11 p.m. to the address where the Jeep is registered, Thompson said. As they spoke with the home's residents, police saw Herrera-Garcia's Jeep drive by. A pursuit began and officers unsuccessfully tried to stop Herrera-Garcia near 35th Avenue and Thomas Road.

A police helicopter tracked Herrera-Garcia to a convenience store on the southwest corner of 35th Avenue and Camelback Road, Thompson said. SWAT vehicles blocked Herrera-Garcia's Jeep and officers moved in to apprehend him.

Thompson said Herrera-Garcia removed a handgun from his waist, ignored commands to drop it and pointed it at one of the officers. Three officers fired simultaneously at Herrera-Garcia.

Police and firefighters gave Herrera-Garcia first aid, Thompson said. First responders took him to the hospital where he later died.

No police were injured in the incident, Thompson said. The three officers -- a 33-year-old eight-year Phoenix police veteran, a 32-year-old nine-year veteran and a 39-year-old 15-year veteran -- have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure following an officer-involved shooting.

Investigators from the homicide unit and internal affairs are conducting a criminal investigation into the incident, Thompson said.
