A man who was barricaded inside an apartment at a complex in Woodhaven on Tuesday has died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.

Woodhaven police officers were dispatched shortly before 8 a.m. Tuesday to the Southpointe Square Apartments near Gudith and West roads to check on a despondent individual, according to a news release from the police department.

"Officers made contact at the apartment but the adult male would not open the door," police said in the news release. "A teenage male resident of the apartment then answered the door and was evacuated for his safety, as he told officers he heard a gunshot."

Officers were unsuccessful in contacting the man, who was inside a bedroom. Officers made entry a short time later and found the man dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said in a statement.

In Troy, police were involved in a standoff with a 30-year-old barricaded gunman at a home on Brooklawn Drive. That incident started at about 3:25 a.m. Tuesday but the department's Twitter account tweeted at about 5:15 p.m. that the man has been arrested.
