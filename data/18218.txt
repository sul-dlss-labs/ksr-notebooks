A police standoff in the parking lot of the main Ocala library ended Monday afternoon in an apparent suicide, law officers reported.

The Ocala Police Department and other first responders rushed toward the library complex, 2601 SE Fort King St., before noon in reference to a suicide threat. The complex — which includes the main library, the county's growth management office, the Ocala/Marion County Veterans Memorial Park and the county's veterans services office — was put on lockdown while police worked the scene.

All attention was quickly focused on a white SUV in the parking lot. The man inside, later identified as Jeremy Michael Nabozny, 35, had threatened to harm himself and was possibly armed. Ocala police said they tried to establish communications with Nabozny via a public address system but had no success. They somehow obtained his cellphone number and called him, again to no avail. The SWAT team and a military-style vehicle were part of the strong police presence at the scene.

About 1 p.m. law officers moved in toward the vehicle and deployed tear gas. "When the team approached the vehicle it discovered the only occupant ... with a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The subject was pronounced deceased at the scene by Ocala Fire Rescue," Ocala police said in a news release.

Ellis Blancher, a private security guard who works at the library, said a police officer approached him about 11:30 a.m. and told him to lock down the building. Blancher moved all library patrons to the east end of the building so they could shelter in place.

Michael Sturgis, 20, of Ocala, was using the library's public computers when he heard something was happening. Sturgis said he "left so fast" that he couldn't find out what was going on.
