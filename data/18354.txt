A sex-trafficking suspect was shot and killed by police Wednesday at an extended-stay hotel in Carrollton.

The suspect was identified as 25-year-old Malcolm Loren Hickson, police said.

Malcolm Loren Hickson, 25, had a long rap sheet and was wanted on a family violence charge.

Carrollton police and SWAT officers were called to the InTown Suites on West Trinity Mills overnight after a woman being held there against her will escaped and contacted police, authorities say.

The woman told police that Hickson had assaulted her and sold her for sex.

Police say a second woman left the same room later when she went to retrieve something from her car, and officers detained her.

Around 8:30 a.m., Hickson came out of the room with his hands up and a gun in his waistband. He reached for the pistol and was shot by police, authorities say.

Police had several previous run-ins with Hickson, who was a wanted man. He's accused of trying to strangle his girlfriend last week, court documents show.

Because of his violent past, Hickson was considered armed and "very dangerous," DeVito said.

Last Friday, police were called to a home in the 1000 block of Terry Way after Hickson's girlfriend reported an assault.

The woman said she and Hickson had an argument, during which he knocked her down and pinned her to the ground.

She told police he put his hands around her neck and told her that he was going to kill her first, then kill her family and friends. Her face went numb, and "she believed she was going to die," according to a police report.

The woman broke free when her friend arrived and screamed for Hickson to stop. The girlfriend tried to call police, she said, but Hickson smashed her iPhone.

She ran to a neighbor's house to call 911, but Hickson had already fled in his white Mercedes-Benz by the time officers arrived.

A warrant was issued charging Hickson with family violence assault. The next time he crossed paths with police was Wednesday.
