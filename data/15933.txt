Illinois State Police identified the man who was shot and killed Thursday in Massac County as 63-year-old Donald J. Hicks.

The Massac County man was killed by police after pointing his gun at an officer, according to a ISP news release. Massac County deputies responded to a call of a suicidal man threatening to shoot himself at about noon Thursday. After not being able to locate the man, deputies were called out about 1:15 p.m. to Pell Cemetery.

State police and officers from Brookport Police Department joined the deputies and found the man and his vehicle, who refused to stop. Metropolis Police Department deployed stop strips at the intersection of Illinois 145 and Waldo Church Road in Metropolis and successfully stopped the vehicle.

Hicks was armed with a handgun, according to state police, and refused to drop the firearm after he was commanded to by officers. Two Metropolis officers were unable to stop him with Tazers. Hicks then allegedly pointed a gun at an officer and was fatally shot.
