KNOXVILLE ? The death of the 45-year-old man involved in a Friday night standoff with police has been ruled a suicide, authorities said today.

The standoff at 3816 Cate Ave. in Northwest Knoxville began with a report of a domestic argument just before 10 p.m.

"As the initial officer was responding to the scene, a shot was fired," Knoxville Police Department Sgt. Jason Hill said.

Police escorted the man's wife, who wasn't hurt, to safety, then set up a perimeter around the house and spent the next two hours trying to contact the husband, with no success. Officers finally caught a glimpse through a window of the man lying on the floor and went inside, where they found his body, Hill said.

Police also found a pistol believed to have fired the fatal shot.

Hill didn't give the man's name, saying police haven't finished notifying relatives.
