The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is investigating a fatal deputy-involved shooting Wednesday morning in Wellington.

The shooting occurred around 8 a.m. in the 1000 block of Mulberry Place in the Sugar Pond Manor community.

According to Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, two deputies arrived at the residence to escort a woman, who was living at a safe house, to gather belongings at the home.

A man at the home then attacked the deputies with two butcher knives, forcing them to shoot and use a stun gun on the person.

Neither the deputies nor the woman were hurt.

"It's clear that the deputies defended themselves to keep from being stabbed by these two large butcher knives, by this individual," Bradshaw said.

Bradshaw described the man as white and about 37 years of age. He said the sheriff's office had been investigating him in connection with a domestic abuse allegation.

"We had enough information to believe and probable cause to believe that we were going to arrest him within the next few days," Sheriff Bradshaw said.

Chopper 5 flew over the scene and spotted at least 10 law enforcement vehicles outside the residence and about two dozen deputies.

Bradshaw says the State Attorney's Office is on the scene and is conducting an independent investigation.

Both deputies involved are being placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol.
