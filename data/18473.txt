The more than 100 mph chase went to the Redwood City area, where CHP units took over the chase that continued on southbound state Highway 85 and state Highway 237.

Dadabhai exited the freeway at Grant Road in Mountain View and alleedly drove on city streets at speeds of between 70 to 80 mph.

He turned on to East Fremont Avenue in Sunnyvale, where he sped into a parking lot and lost control of the vehicle near Eleanor Way, according to the CHP.

The Honda crashed into a cement light pole, then crashed into five cars parked outside The Patio bar.

Brown-Glaspie was ejected from the car that overturned. He landed on a sidewalk and was pronounced dead at the scene.
