BEECHER Few would guess what sits behind the tall fence in the back corner of the abandoned site of a fast-food restaurant.



This is where up to three homeless men lived and where one of them died in a shooting Saturday night.

Gunfire erupted outside the cooler about 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Three men, all of whom police said are homeless, were shot. One died, but police have not yet identified him.

The gunman, Anthony Williams, 47, who lived at the motel next door, continued firing when police arrived, until they shot and killed him.

Tiffany Draine said just a few weeks ago that the homeless man who was killed helped her husband put up a swing set. She fed him a big bowl of soup as a thank you.

She didnt know until Monday that he was the one killed. She said she saw him early Saturday morning, just hours before he was killed.

She often prayed for God to help the men, Draine said as she looked over the cooler and all their abandoned possessions.

On Monday, the door to their home still hung open. A single cot, piled high with blankets, was visible inside as well as some pillows on the floor.

Five prescription bottles sat on the corner of the bed and several empty liquor bottles were visible in the trash, scattered inside the fenced in area.

People dont know people are living up in there, Draine said.
