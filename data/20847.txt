It was the middle of the night in a quiet neighborhood of this city's southwest side. The big stacks of Ford's famous Rouge plant loomed over more than 100 people lining South Fort Street, most of them there to see the two Mustangs that were revving their engines at a makeshift starting line.

Drag racing is illegal, and when four police officers rolled up to the scene in two cars, the participants prepared to leave. But the race began as planned, prosecutors say, after one of the officers announced that they were there just to watch and would not make any arrests.

As if to reassure the racers, the prosecution says, the officers pumped music through their public address system.

The cars tore from the line, reaching speeds of more than 100 miles an hour, said Rebecca Tenorio, a spokeswoman for the Wayne County prosecutor's office. One vehicle quickly went out of control and veered into a crowd. Denise Jones, a 35-year-old mother of two, was standing on the sidewalk when the car hit her. She died less than an hour later.
