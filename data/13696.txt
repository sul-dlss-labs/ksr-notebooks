Dustin Raymond Hoffman, 34, of Sherwood died Friday on a Burke County road near Eastgate after fleeing from police across three counties.

The North Dakota Highway Patrol said police were pursuing Hoffman after attempting a traffic stop against him in Bottineau County. The patrol said Hoffman continued to flee through Bottineau County, through Renville County and into Burke County, where he failed to negotiate a curve on a gravel road, struck an approach and vaulted through the air.
