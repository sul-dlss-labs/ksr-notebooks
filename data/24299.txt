The man allegedly involved in a standoff with authorities in Walthourville Monday morning has died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Liberty County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities said Langley took a Sheila Drive woman and her 21-year-old daughter hostage around 1 a.m. Jennings said the woman was able to escape after he convinced him to check on our daughter. She ran to a neighbor's home to call police.

Jennings said Langley fired several shots inside the home.
