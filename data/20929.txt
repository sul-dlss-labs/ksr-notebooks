HOLLAND, MI -- Police have identified a Holland man killed in a crash that occurred as he fled a traffic stop.

Jeremy Dorell Hudson, 33, was driving a Mitsubishi Outlander that a Holland police officer spotted speeding from an apartment complex on Stratford Way near 12th Street about 10 p.m. Tuesday, authorities said.

Police said Hudson refused to stop for the officer and blew through a stop sign and red light, eventually driving into the intersection at 8th Street and U.S. 31.

Ottawa County sheriff's authorities, who are handling the crash investigation, said Hudson's car approached traffic that was stopped on westbound 8th Street and entered the eastbound lanes to maneuver around the cars. Hudson drove through the red light and hit a northbound Ford Taurus and then struck a Chevy Silverado, deputies said.

Hudson was ejected and died on scene. He was not wearing a seat belt. Authorities said he was driving on a suspended/revoked license.

The driver of the Taurus, 21-year-old Nicole Kupres, of Fennville, was treated at the scene and later transported to a hospital in good condition. She was wearing a seat belt.

Three occupants of the pickup truck also suffered injuries and are hospitalized in good condition. The driver, Kyle Barton, and front seat passenger, Laura Barton, both 41, of Holland, and a 3-year-old child were belted.
