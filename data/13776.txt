GLENDALE, Ariz. â€” A woman was hit and killed in a vehicle crash involving a Glendale police officer.

The accident happened Saturday at 67th Avenue and Glendale Avenue. Police say Officer Cody Howard was responding to a non-emergency call when he crashed into a van that turned in front of him.

Glendale police say the van and squad car collided in the intersection and the impact caused the van to land on a corner sidewalk where it hit two pedestrians, a male and a female.

The woman, Glendale resident Dorothy Cochran, was thrown into a parking lot where she was then hit by another car. She was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead. Authorities said she was in her 60s.

The male pedestrian, identified as Glendale resident Elmer Hicks, has suffered life-threatening injuries.

The driver of the van, Glendale resident Robert Escobedo, suffered serious injuries while Howard was also taken to the hospital with what police describe as not life-threatening injuries.

Investigators say there is no indication that Howard was driving with lights and sirens on. Vehicular Crimes Unit detectives are investigating.
