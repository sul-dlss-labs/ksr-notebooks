Dearborn, Mich. has agreed to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit over a 2003 fatal crash caused by one of its traffic officers.

The settlement was reached this week, The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press reported.

Agron Seiko, who was assigned to write parking tickets and impound cars, joined a police chase without being ordered to and crashed into a car, killing William V. Owen IV.

State police said Seiko ran a red light and was traveling about 60 miles per hour in a 40 mph zone in snowy conditions. Seiko pleaded no contest to negligent homicide and was put on probation.

A Wayne County Circuit jury last year ordered that Owen’s family be paid more than $20 million.

Dearborn and its insurer, AIG Insurance Co., appealed the damage order, saying there had been improper conduct in the trial.

A telephone and an e-mail message seeking comment were left Thursday before business hours with Owen family lawyer Paul W. Broschay.

City lawyer Chip Boyle said the city was pleased with the settlement. “It was an unfortunate tragedy that happened, and the city was responsible for that because of their employee,” Boyle said.
