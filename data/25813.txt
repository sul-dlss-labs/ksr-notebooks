CHESAPEAKE, Va. â€” Chesapeake police found a man dead inside a home after an hours-long standoff with SWAT and law enforcement Thursday, an official said.

The SWAT situation began in the morning in the 4100 block of Nina Drive when a man exited the home and fired several shots at police, PIO Leo Kosinski said in a news release.

Around 12:25 p.m., the man came out of the home's front door and fired his gun again toward SWAT team officers. Officers shot back at the man, but Kosinski said police do not know if the man was hit during that exchange.

Later, another gunshot was heard inside the house.

Police determined that he was dead and the investigation is still on going.

Nina Drive and Pinta Drive are still closed for traffic from San Salvador Drive to Dock Landing Road.
