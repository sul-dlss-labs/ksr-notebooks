ALHAMBRA >> Police fatally shot a man who opened fire on them as they responded to domestic disturbance in Alhambra late Friday, authorities said.

The officer-involved shooting took place about 7:50 p.m. in the 2900 block of West Main Street, near Huntington Drive, according to Deputy Lisa Jansen of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s Homicide Bureau.

Officers responded to the neighborhood after a woman called 911 to report a “domestic disturbance” involving herself, her husband and their 25-year-old son, she said. The woman added that her son may have a gun.

Gunshots rang out as officers neared the home, officials said.

“When the officers positioned themselves across the street from the suspect’s residence, the suspect shot several rounds at them, and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Jansen said in a written statement.

Paramedics took the wounded suspect to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries, deputy Trina Schrader said.

A shotgun and a revolver believed to have been wielded by the suspect were found at the scene.

No officers were hurt in the gunfight, and the suspect’s parents also suffered no injuries during the incident,

Video posted on social media by a witness shows two officer taking cover behind a car as they were seemingly shot at from across the street.

After firing a volley of apparent return fire with rifles, the two officers are seen running toward the source of the gunfire before additional shots can be heard a little more than 20 seconds later.

“Both Alhambra officers were wearing body cameras, and a review of the video footage will take place as part of the investigation,” Jansen said.

Detectives from the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau are handling the investigation. Anyone with information can reach the bureau at 323-890-5500.
