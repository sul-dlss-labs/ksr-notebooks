CHAMBLEE, Ga. — An armed man was shot and killed after attempting to rob AutoZone, Chamblee police said.

Surveillance footage showed the man, 21-year-old Broderick Lyndon Johnson, walking into the store. He then ordered the manager to tie up all his employees and open the safe, police said.

Then the manager counted his employees and noticed one was missing. That employee had hidden to call 911, according to police.

Chamblee police arrived and can be seen on the video, as one officer approached the front door of the store with his weapon drawn.

He was met at the front of the store by the robber, and the two began fighting. Police said the officer chased the man through the store and tackled him, causing the two to crash through the front door.

A second officer saw that Johnson was armed and shot and killed him.

Employees and customers alike were thankful no one else was hurt.

“This area is a not-so-good area. It's a dangerous area,” David Lu said.

Lu said he is a loyal AutoZone customer who had shopped at the store hours before the incident.

Another customer said the incident will not prevent him from returning to a store he frequents.

“Crime can occur anywhere, so it’s not really that big a deal to me. As long as I keep myself protected, I’m happy,” Eric Bell said.
