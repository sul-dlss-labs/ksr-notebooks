A police investigation of a homicide in Inkster led to a fatal confrontation with officers and a suspect Thursday night.

Inkster police responded to a homicide call on Frederick Court at 5 p.m. when an officer saw a person matching the suspect's description nearby, at Colgate and Wellington.

That suspect pulled a hand gun and shot at the Inkster police officer who returned fire, striking the man and killing him, according to Michigan State Police Lt. Michael Shaw. Police are now investigating two deaths at two separate shooting scenes, which happened minutes apart.

Shaw said that Inkster police had responded to the scene only a few minutes after receiving the call and that the weapon of the suspect - who was an adult - has been recovered.

Both crime scenes are being combed through by Michigan State Police detectives who have a working partnership with Inkster PD, Shaw said.

Shaw said that there is not a second suspect being sought by police, but that the department has received threats due to misinformation about tonight's incident.

"We did receive some threats to law enforcement, both Michigan State Police and Inkster police from callers thinking that it was an unarmed shooting," Shaw said. "That cannot be farther from the truth."

Police are looking into what led to the first homicide, Shaw said.

"We are looking into the motivation for the first homicide," he said. "We are investigating whether if this was some kind of beef between these two guys."
