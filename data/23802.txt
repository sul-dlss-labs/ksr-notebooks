A man who was shot by Jackson police near Jackson State University has died, officials confirmed Monday.

Lee Edward Bonner, 37, was shot Wednesday afternoon in the 1300 block of Deer Park Street, according to Jackson Police Department Sgt. Roderick Holmes.

JPD officials said narcotics officers were in the area investigating possible drug activity when they came in contact with two men who immediately ran.

Officers chased both suspects on foot to a nearby abandoned house. One man escaped while the other man produced a handgun and fired at the officers. They returned fire, striking the suspect.
