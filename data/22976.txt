AUBURN, SCHUYLKILL COUNTY (WBRE/WYOU) — Fleeing from the police has a fatal ending for a local businessman. The community where he works is trying to piece together what happened, and why he would try to get away.



49-year-old Kenneth Ferraiolo of Schuylkill Haven posted this picture on his Facebook Tuesday night saying he was “out for dinner on the bike”. But no one knew that would be his last post.



Police in Berks County say they attempted to pull him over for a traffic violation on route 61. Troopers say Ferraiolo drove recklessly, trying to get away.



“I wonder why he was doing that?”



He fled through the borough of Centerport. That’s when investigators say a Nissan Altima backed out of a driveway. Ferraiolo tried to stop his motorcycle — creating a large skid mark in the road. He crashed into the Nisan’s driver’s side door, and was thrown from the impact. He died on the ground.



“Oh wow I’m in a state of shock,” said Barbara Burke, who lives near his shop in Auburn.



Burke lives on the same street as Ferraiolo’s shop in Schuylkill County. He owned Weller’s, a chimney sweep and lightening protection business.



“He waved every time he went by, he was a very friendly man, very nice. I’m very sorry to hear that,” said Burke.



“Well, it’s always sad to lose someone who’s a part of the community,” said Kayla Milkins, who also lives near the shop.



But it leaves the question — why wouldn’t he pull over for police? State police in Schuylkill Haven/Summit Station and Hamburg say they are investigating.



“I’m shocked that he would be running from the cops,” said Milkins.



“To get killed over running from the cops… well that’s sad,” said Burke.



Community members hope his business continues to thrive.

The driver of the nissan was not injured.
