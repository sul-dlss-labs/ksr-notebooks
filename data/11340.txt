LaGRANGE, N.Y. — A trooper shot and killed a robber who struck him with a sawed-off rifle as police responded to a home invasion in this Dutchess County town, state police said on Tuesday. State police said they received a 911 call from a house on Hettinger Lane about 10:20 p.m. and that when troopers arrived there, one entered the house through the front, while another went around the back. The trooper who entered the home was confronted by an armed man, and after the man struck the trooper, the trooper shot him dead, police said. The deceased was identified late Tuesday as Abdelle Jean St. Ange, 22, of Poughkeepsie. Police did not provide the name of the trooper who fired the fatal shot. They said St. Ange’s body was removed by the Dutchess County Medical Examiner’s Office. Four other suspects fled from the house but were caught later by state police and Dutchess County Sheriff’s deputies, police said. Those suspects — identified as Alphonso L. Brown, 18, of Poughkeepsie; Evan M. Davis 20, of Poughkeepsie; Dwayne L. White, 27, Wappingers Falls; and Kevin C. Madison, 25, of Wappingers Falls — were charged with felony robbery and felony burglary and were sent to the Dutchess County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail each, police said. Two troopers involved in the incident were treated at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie and released. The occupants of the home were accounted for and led to safety, police said. Police did not identify the occupants or say why their house was targeted. Alvina Stelluti, who lives nearby, said was awakened by a police helicopter flying overhead and by the lights from police cars. “I was very frightened that someone could have come right through my back yard to my home,” she said. “I’m frightened that this could happen in our wonderful little neighborhood, but I am glad the police are on top of things, and I will be contacting my security system to have it upgraded.”
