A Baltimore police officer is in Shock Trauma after a shooting at a methadone clinic Monday morning that left a suspect and another man dead.

Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said the shooting was reported at 7:09 a.m. at the Man Alive methadone clinic in the 2100 block of Maryland Avenue. Police received a call about an armed person.

The gunman had already fired two shots before police arrived at the clinic, Harrison said.

"When we arrived, this was actually treated as an active shooter scenario because we were informed when we got there (that) there was a suspect in the building who had fired a gun at least two times," Harrison said.

Harrison said the officers tried to de-escalate the situation, but the suspect began shooting at the officers.



"As the suspect fired upon our officer, he returned gunfire but was struck by the suspect's rounds," Harrison said.



Baltimore police Sgt. Bill Shiflett, a 25-year veteran assigned to the Northern District, was shot in his lower abdomen under his bulletproof vest. Shock Trauma officials said Shiflett underwent surgery and was taken to the intensive care unit.

"The officer arrived, he was awake, talking, was complaining of abdominal pain. His vital signs were normal. His exam was suggestive that he needed an urgent operation and he was taken into the operating room by the trauma attending," Shock Trauma Dr. James O'Connor said.

"We only fired at one suspect," Harrison said. "We only encountered one suspect who fired at our officer and we only fired in one direction at one person."

Police identified the suspect Tuesday as Ashanti Pinkney, 49, who lived in a nearby apartment building.

Police identified the clinic employee who was fatally shot as David Caldwell, 52.

Police said a 41-year-old female employee of the clinic was also injured during this incident.

"She was transported to a hospital, and her injuries, at this time, are not believed to be life-threatening," Harrison said.

Pippy Scott, a patient, was in the clinic speaking with her counselor when the gunman arrived. Scott said the man held a gun to the head of a staff member.
