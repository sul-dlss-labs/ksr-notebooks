Michigan State Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting Sunday in Dearborn Heights that left a Redford Township man dead.

The fatal shooting took place about 3:30 a.m. in the area of Telegraph and Warren, near the Boneyard restaurant, said Lt. Mike Shaw, a spokesman for the state police.

Dearborn Heights police initially were dispatched to contact a "distraught woman" walking around the area. But an officer spotted a man walking on Telegraph, carrying a rifle. The man was later identified as Jim Collins Jr., 38, from Redord Township.

A loaded long gun was recovered from the scene, MSP tweeted, and investigators were reviewing video and talking to witnesses.

The officer made contact with the man and words were exchanged, after which he fired shots at the suspect, killing him, police said.

The Dearborn Heights Police Department then requested Michigan State Police to take over the investigation. MSP's Special Investigative Section is handling the case.

"Everything is so preliminary, so early, it's kind of hard to tell where we are," Shaw said in a media briefing near the scene. Video of the briefing was posted on Twitter.

Police are talking to the slain man's family and trying to learn his history. Hours after the incident, state police described him as a 38-year-old Redford Township man.

State police have deployed a drone at the scene, which, along with computer technology, will take photos and plot the scene.

The officer who fired the shots has been placed on administrative leave that would leave allow the officer "to get some care for himself and go through the investigation process," Shaw said. He has been on the job less than five years.

The distraught woman who triggered the 911 call has been spotted on video but had not yet been contacted by police, Shaw said.

Lee Gavin, chief of the Dearborn Heights Police Department, declined to comment, citing the ongoing investigation.
