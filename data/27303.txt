GREELEY, Colo. (CBS4) - Dramatic police body cam video just released shows the perspective of a Greeley officer who was shot in the arm during a shootout with a man named Russell Cooley two months ago. The situation started as a shots fired call in Greeley during a road rage incident on Nov. 14 and turned into a chase. It then ended with a shootout and a standoff in Evans.

The video shared by authorities in Weld County shows the moment glass shattered after Cooley fired shots at the officer's car windshield and window using a high-powered rifle. The officer then takes cover behind the door of his cruiser and runs toward his fellow officers for help. He asks for help putting a tourniquet on his arm.

Cooley's girlfriend was shot in the leg during the shootout. She was in the vehicle Cooley was driving and a bullet fired by an officer hit her.

"There was over 55 high-powered rifle rounds that were shot at this officer and others during this incident," said Greeley Police Chief Mark Jones.

Cooley ended up running from the scene to his house, where he barricaded himself and eventually took his own life.

The officer has been recovering since getting shot and is expected to return to full-time active duty soon.
