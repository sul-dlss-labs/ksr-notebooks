A New York Post delivery truck collided with a police car headed to a report of gunfire early yesterday morning, killing the driver of the truck and a police officer, the authorities said.

The authorities described the accident as a horrendous crash.

The 33,000-pound truck struck the passenger side of the police car at 3:37 a.m. at Bay Ridge Parkway and 18th Avenue in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn. The truck driver, Jacques Lavache, 38, was thrown from the cab. He was pronounced dead at Lutheran Medical Center.

The authorities said the truck barreled on after the collision, pushing the police cruiser over the curb and crushing it against the wall of the New Way Supermarket.

Two police officers -- David Regan, 27, and Kenneth Waszak, 34 -- were trapped inside the car.

An Emergency Service Unit removed them from the wreckage, but Officer Regan, who was in the front passenger seat, was pronounced dead at Maimonides Medical Center.
