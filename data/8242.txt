Santa Clara police shot and killed a man investigators believe to be 21-year-old murder suspect from Marysville Sunday, a police sergeant said.



Around 11:30 a.m. an officer spotted a man he believed was Ian Sloan York at Bowe Avenue and El Camino Real after investigators from Marysville warned police York might be in the city, Santa Clara police Sgt. Ray Carreira said.

Marysville officers suspect York shot his 19-year-old girlfriend in the chest, and another man in an extremity around 11:30 p.m. Saturday in the 2300 block of Cheim Boulevard, Marysville police Sgt. II John Osbourn said. His girlfriend died and the man was treated and released from a hospital, Osbourn said.

Witnesses told police York, who recently moved from Indiana to Marysville, had been arguing with his girlfriend earlier that evening.

However neither police departments are able to confirm York the man who died today, and the medical examiner has not yet released the identity.



The person they believe to be York allegedly shot at the officer who spotted him today and the officer returned fire, Carreira said.



Surrounding agencies responded, including the Sunnyvale Police Department and the California Highway Patrol. He then fled near Saratoga Creek, near a shopping center.



When they found him about an hour later, more shots were fired and the man was killed near El Camino Real, police said.



Osbourn said Placer County sheriff's deputies found an abandoned black Chrysler Crossfire that witnesses said York used to leave the Marysville home Saturday night.
