DECATUR, AL -- Decatur police shot and killed a man Thursday night after he held his mother hostage and pointed a shotgun at police, authorities said.

A woman contacted police shortly before 4 p.m. and said she'd been held hostage by her son for three days in her home at 3703 Neches Court, but had managed to get away. She met with police and told them she'd been threatened with a gun, a knife and a box cutter.

Police arrived at the home around 4 p.m. where they found Donald Thomas Prince, 58, barricaded inside with no telephone service. From outside the home, officers tried to negotiate a peaceful arrest, authorities said.

Prince put down the shotgun shortly after 7 p.m. and officers shot him through a window with a taser. The taser didn't work, and Prince once again, picked up his shotgun, police said.

When he pointed it at officers, police fired several times, killing Prince.

In the past, Prince has suffered from paranoid tendencies and depression, police said.

Decatur police are investigating the shooting, along with the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. Per department policy, the officers involved are on administrative duty until the investigation is complete.
