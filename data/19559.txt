A man is dead after an officer-involved shooting at a west Phoenix mobile home park.

Officers responded to the Wester Acres Mobile Park near 66th Avenue and Van Buren Street on Thursday around 5:30 p.m. after a woman called 911 because her two sons were fighting.

The woman indicated that her 24-year-old son was acting "aggressively and erratically," police said.

By the time officers arrived, only the 24-year-old son was still at the home. When police went inside in an attempt to talk to the man he allegedly ran into the kitchen, grabbed a knife and charged at officers, officials said.

An unidentified 33-year-old officer shot the suspect, a police spokesperson said. He was taken to a local trauma center where he later died.

Family members told authorities that the suspect had a felony warrant out for his arrest stemming from a parole violation. He previously told witnesses that he wasn't going back to prison and if ever contacted by authorities he would "fight them," a police spokesperson said.

No officers were injured during the incident. Officials said it is unknown if the man was impaired but an investigation is ongoing.

Additional details have not yet been released.
