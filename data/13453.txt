Plainfield police have identified two suspects — one of whom was killed — in a police-action shooting Tuesday night.

Eric William Allen Poore, 27, Lafayette, was shot and killed by officers after police said he raised a gun at them. The officers were entering a home in the 200 block of Andrews Boulevard on a report of a burglary in progress.

Another suspect, Justin David Pearson, was arrested unharmed. His age and hometown were not immediately clear, but police said he was charged with two counts of robbery and criminal confinement, as well as firearm enhancement.
