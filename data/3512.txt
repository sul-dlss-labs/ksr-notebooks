A Dothan police officer is back on the job after being involved in a second fatal police chase this year.

Investigators say Officer Phillip Wise tried to stop two men in a speeding automobile last Friday morning. Instead they say Kevin Jones and Zacharia Jones tried to get away, only to die when their car crashed into a building.

A Dothan Police Review Board studied the case and cleared Officer Wise on Monday. Officer Wise was involved in another fatal crash in January, and was cleared of any wrong-doing.
