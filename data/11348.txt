BESSEMER, Alabama -- Authorities have released the identity of a man fatally shot by police early today after officers say he lunged at them, and threw a knife at one of them.

Jefferson County sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian identified the man as Parish Laconley Powell, 38, of Bessemer.

Bessemer police and firefighters responded to a medical aid call at Powell's home in the 800 block of Dartmouth Avenue about 1:30 a.m.

The caller told the 911 operator that Powell was agitated and combative. As they tried to assess him, he ran to the kitchen and picked up two knives, authorities said.

Officers drew their weapons and tried to talk the man into dropping the knives, Christian said. He refused, and ordered officers to put their weapons away. When they didn't, he lunged at an officer and threw one of the knives at him.

The officer shot him. He was taken to UAB Hospital in Birmingham, where Christian said Powell died in surgery about 4:30 a.m.

Christian said the sheriff's office is investigating the police-involved shooting at the request of Bessemer police.

"It's a tragedy anytime there is a life lost and we are sorry for the family left behind to grieve," Christian said today. "A knife is certainly considered a deadly weapon and was a fatal mistake to make."

"We will continue to gather information and make sure the evidence matches the facts," he said. "So far there is nothing to indicate the officer's actions were improper."
