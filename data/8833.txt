Kansas City, Kan. â€“ It's still not clear which law officer fired the shot that killed a Kansas City Kansas man yesterday afternoon. Officers from several jurisdictions were there.

Kansas City, Kansas police say they had no role in the shooting of 18 year old Anthony Clemons. A spokesman says that a federal task force including Kansas City, Missouri narcotics police had chased two cars engaged in a gunfight. And someone in that task force killed Clemons when he aimed gun at them.

Kansas City, Missouri Chief Jim Corwin says he and his Kansas City, Kansas counterpart Sam Breshears were talking to each other minutes after the shooting.

Corwin relates there is less friction between departments than in the past, "Pretty much everybody knows who's doing what and that's part of our training now to make sure we clear it with our counterparts and making sure everyone knows who the players are and what we're doing in each one's jurisdictions."

These task forces usually operate for a specific reason and can be found most anywhere in the region.
