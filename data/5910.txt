Ms. Lindboe was pronounced dead at Staten Island University Hospital North at 9 a.m., the police said. The woman she had stabbed, Linda Padula, 58, who lived across the hallway, was taken to the same hospital, and remained in serious condition yesterday, having suffered stab wounds to her head, neck, shoulder and upper chest, the police said.

The violence occurred in a two-story brick building in the Bay Terrace neighborhood, an area of middle-income housing complexes bordered on the south by a railroad line. What sparked it was unclear, the police said, but neighbors said it might have started because of Ms. Lindboe's cat, Dickie, who was found with a stab wound to an eye after the shooting. Those same neighbors said that Ms. Lindboe had lived in the apartment, part of a complex called Kensington Gardens, for more than a year, and that her neighbor, Ms. Padula, had lived there longer.

Residents said that they saw Ms. Lindboe walking barefoot in the snow, or heard her doing her laundry at 5 a.m. She was known to walk naked in front of her windows, and was rarely seen wearing anything other than a nightgown. Music from the 1930's would blare from her apartment at odd hours.

Ms. Lindboe's cat caused problems, residents said, adding that Ms. Padula had complained in the past of the cat urinating and defecating in the hallway. Ms. Lindboe had also had pet mice that occasionally escaped, residents said.

Around 4:30 a.m., as she had in the past, Ms. Lindboe buzzed her neighbors to let her in, said Rich Infantino, 28, who lives in a basement apartment. She did this after parking her car next to the building's swimming pool. "It was non-stop buzzing for nearly 20 minutes," he said. He let her in and went back to sleep.
