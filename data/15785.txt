An overnight car crash in Limestone County claimed four lives this weekend. Authorities confirm they were pursuing the vehicle that caused the wreck.

Sgt. Steve Jarrett of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said Madison police and Limestone County deputies were trying to catch up to a 2002 GMC Yukon driven by 40-year-old Terrance Walker of Huntsville early Sunday. Alabama State Troopers investigating the wreck say the Yukon ran a stop sign on U.S. 72 about a mile out of Huntsville when it crashed into a 2005 Ford Focus. Both drivers were killed, as were the two passengers in the Ford.

It is not clear at this time why authorities were pursuing Walker. Because Alabama State Troopers are handling the investigation, questions were directed to the Huntsville post. The Madison Police Department also referred media to the troopers post. The Limestone County Sheriff's Office could not be reached Tuesday.

Also killed in the wreck were Yoneko Renee Cain, 31, of Athens, Larneal Donell McDonald, 29, of Belle Mina and Mario Lamar Sledge, 26, of Athens. Troopers say Cain, who was driving the Ford, was the only one of the four wearing a seat belt.
