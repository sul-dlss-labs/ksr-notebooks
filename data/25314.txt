A man killed a woman Wednesday morning outside the Craig-Botetourt Electric Cooperative in New Castle and later sped away from authorities before fatally shooting himself, state police said.

James E. Bayne, 52, of Covington opened fire outside cooperative headquarters at 8:09 a.m. Craig County sheriff’s deputies found Ashley N. Bayne, 31, of Covington dead on a sidewalk outside the building, state police said in a news release.

James Bayne drove off in a black Dodge Charger, which was spotted about 30 minutes later on U.S. 220 in Botetourt County by a sheriff’s deputy who tried to stop it. Bayne reached a speed of 110 mph, according to state police. The car finally stopped near Valley Road (State Route 779) at Daleville. When deputies approached, they found Bayne with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to state police.

He was taken to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where he died from his injuries. Police recovered a handgun from the car.

State police said Ashley Bayne and James Bayne “had a domestic relationship, but were not married nor were they related.”

The utility company said in a Facebook post that Ashley Bayne was a staff accountant, and that James Bayne was not an employee of Craig-Botetourt Electric.

“Please keep Ashley’s family and our co-op family in your thoughts and prayers during the difficult days ahead, and God Bless our CBEC family,” the post reads.

The office will be closed until Dec. 26.

It was the first homicide in Craig County since 2008, according to state police crime reports.

Craig County schools were on lockdown for about an hour Wednesday morning while the incident was investigated.
