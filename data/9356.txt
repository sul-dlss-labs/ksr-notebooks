Four Denver police officers were cleared of any wrongdoing in the Aug. 1 shooting death of Alfred Raymond Vigil, the Denver District Attorney’s Office said today.

The officers, Dustin Duff, Sean Cronin, Rick Guzman, and Ryan Taylor, shot Vigil when he raised what was later found to be a pellet gun at them at the Trump Plaza Apartments at 4950 Morrison Road.

According to the report — a standard investigation in all police-involved shootings — Vigil called 9-1-1 and said he intended to commit “suicide by cop.”

When officers arrived, Vigil was outside his apartment pacing back and forth with the gun to his own head, the report states. As officers urged him to put the weapon down, he instead urged them to shoot him.

Twelve minutes after the first officer arrived, “Vigil suddenly brought the gun up in a sweeping motion in the direction of the officers,” the report states. “His actions support a conclusion that he clearly intended to draw their fire.”

He died of multiple gunshot wounds.

The report states Duff fired five rounds, Cronin one and Guzman and Taylor fired three rounds each.

Before the shooting, Cronin had requested a 40 mm “less lethal” beanbag gun.

“This reflects the intent and efforts of the officers to resolve the confrontation without injury to anyone,” the report states.
