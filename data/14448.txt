MARTINEZ — A Concord man who was killed in a high-speed crash while trying to elude police was found in a coroner’s inquiry Friday to have died as the result of an accident.

Concord police say Michael Lee Holden, 19, was driving recklessly and without headlights the night of May 6, 2014. When a Concord police officer attempted a traffic stop, Holden sped away on southbound Interstate 680. He was involved in a solo vehicle crash near El Cerro Boulevard in Danville.

Holden died of his injuries three days later at John Muir Medical Center. Police later determined he was driving a stolen car.

Coroner’s inquests are conducted in Contra Costa County for every officer-involved or in-custody death. Jurors hear from witnesses and are asked to determine the manner of death, choosing from natural causes, suicide, accident and at the hands of another other than by accident. No civil or criminal liability is assigned.
