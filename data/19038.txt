A man was fatally shot during a confrontation with Gardena police late Thursday, sheriff’s deputies said.

Sheriff’s Department detectives, who are investigating the shooting, said Gardena officers were patrolling the 1000 block of West Rosecrans Avenue about 10:30 p.m. when they noticed a disturbance in the parking lot of a business.

The officers stopped to assist a security guard in quelling the disturbance between several patrons. During the encounter, one of the males fired at least one round and fled west away from the parking lot.

As Gardena officers tried to apprehend the man in the 14100 block of Van Buren Court, an officer fired his weapon and the suspect was struck at least once in the torso. Sheriff’s deputies did not disclose what precipitated the shooting.

The unidentified man, described only as a black adult, was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police recovered two handguns believed to belong to the suspect. No officers were injured in the confrontation.

The sheriff’s investigation is ongoing and no further details were available.
