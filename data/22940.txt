A 25-year-old man died in a crash following a police pursuit in Springfield Township, Monday morning.

At around 12:03 a.m., John Bowen III, 25, of Akron was driving a blue 2002 Pontiac Grand Prix eastbound on Swartz Road while being pursued by a Summit County Deputy Sheriff.

Bowen was driving at a high speed when he lost control of his car, causing him to go off the right side of the roadway and into a utility pole.

The Summit County Coroner's Office pronounced Bowen dead at the scene.

Bowen was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash. It's unknown if alcohol and drugs contributed to the crash.
