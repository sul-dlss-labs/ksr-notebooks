Kevin Wicks, 38, a black man was killed by an Inglewood police officer in the 100 block of North Hillcrest Blvd. in Inglewood about 12:30 a.m. Monday, July 21.

According to a statement from the Inglewood Police Department, officers responded to a radio call of a domestic disturbance at Wicks' apartment. Police said officers knocked on the door, and Wicks opened it. "At one point while the door was ajar, the officers observed that Wicks was holding a handgun," the statement said. "Wicks then suddenly raised the handgun at the officers, which resulted in one officer firing his weapon in self-defense."

Wicks was taken by ambulance to an area hospital where he was pronounced dead. Police said a gun registered to Wicks was recovered at the scene. Several residents say the officers were at the wrong location, but police said that was not the case. Hours after the shooting, family members, residents and community activists gathered outside Wicks' apartment complex to speak out against the shooting. Family members said Wicks worked for the U.S. Postal Service and had two daughters.

Police said they have placed Officer Brian Ragan, who's been with the department for 5 1/2 years, on administrative leave following the shooting. Ragan was also placed on administrative leave May 11 for the shooting of Michael Byoune, 19, Larry White 19, and Chris Larkin 21. Byoune died from his wounds. This is the second officer-involved shooting this month in Inglewood. On July 1, 23-year-old Ruben Walton Ortega was shot to death in an alley during a foot pursuit.
