Authorities identified the teenager killed in rollover crash near Lincoln Wednesday morning.Officials said Zayne Yost, 14, of Lincoln, was pronounced dead at the scene. Yost was a freshman at Northwest High School."Zayne was a great kid," said his older brother Gage Davis."That kid had great potential in everything he did."All four individuals in the 2003 Chevy Trailblazer were ejected, Yost was the only fatal victim.The other three were taken to Bryan Medical Center and Bryan West Campus. Their injuries are not life threatening.Officials said they spotted the stolen SUV in southwest Lincoln.Deputies tried to contact the individuals inside and the SUV fled, but the deputy did not pursue, as he was in an unmarked sheriff's car.Around 8 a.m., the same deputy saw the same SUV and called for backup.Lancaster County Chief Deputy Todd Duncan said the pursuit began on the interchange on Highway 77 and Interstate 80."It was a pretty short interaction between our deputies and the stolen car," Duncan said.The driver fled west on I-80, got on the off-ramp to northwest 48th Street, lost control of the vehicle and flipped several times.Investigators said the other individuals inside were 16, 15 and 14 years old. The 16-year-old is a student at North Star High School. The 15-year-old is a student at Northeast High school and the 14-year-old is a student from North Star."Our thoughts are with all four of them. Obviously it's a tragedy anytime anyone gets seriously injured," Duncan said.The Lancaster County Sheriff's Office and Nebraska State Patrol are investigating.Derow Young, a long-time friend and mentor to Yost said he had a kind heart."He loved my little son and always would come and play with him and good heart for any kid and he always wanted to help some body," Young said.Family and friends hope people will not be quick to judge Yost. They know he came from a loving family who is now grieving.Not everybody is perfect, by all means. People make mistakes and when you make mistakes you learn from it. This is something he can't learn from. This is something we have to learn from, why, because he isn't here anymore," Davis said.A grand jury will be called to look into the death since it happened while law enforcement was trying to bring the suspects into custody.Meanwhile, friends have set up a GoFund Me account to help the family pay for funeral expenses.
