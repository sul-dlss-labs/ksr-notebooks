MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) -- There's new information on a shootout that occurred Wednesday night with Montgomery police.

One suspect is dead and three others are charged with murder while a Montgomery police officer is recovering in the hospital. We've also learned that two officers are on administrative leave while the case is investigated.

Police say it all started when four men broke into a home on North Pass Road just off the Northern Boulevard.

When police got to the scene, they say the four armed robbery suspects left out the back of the home and started shooting.

Three suspects were shot while the other one surrendered to police.

One of the suspects, 16-year-old Roderick Johnson, died from his wounds early Thursday morning.

Other suspects, identified as 19-year-old George Sanders, 38-year-old Samuel Giles and 19-year-old Harrison Giles were charged with felony murder and seven counts of robbery.

Each suspect is being held at the Montgomery County Dentention Facility. Sanders and Samuel Giles are being held on $800,000 bond each while Harrison Giles is being held on $1 million bond.

Police will not confirm who shot the 16-year-old suspect until afterthe Alabama Bureau of Investigation completes its investigation.

Under state law, each man is criminally responsible for Johnson's death and will be charged with his murder because he died "under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to human life while engaging in conduct which creates a grave risk of death."

The officer was shot in the chest and is now in stable condition at Baptist South. His name has not been released.

There were seven people inside the home when the four men broke in. Police say one person inside suffered a minor gunshot wound to the foot and is okay.
