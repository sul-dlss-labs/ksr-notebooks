NORTH HOLLYWOOD >> The 54-year-old man who shot and killed himself after a brief standoff with police in North Hollywood was identified Wednesday by the coronerâ€™s office as Jose Montes Vasquez of North Hollywood.

Officers from the North Hollywood Division of the Los Angeles Police Department responded to a call about a suicidal man armed with a gun about 11:30 a.m. Sunday, according to police.

Vasquez had barricaded himself behind a wall underneath trees in a parking lot behind a business near Burbank Boulevard and Satsuma Avenue, said LAPD Sgt. Francisco Albarran.

Officers tried to talk with him and get him some help but the man refused to come out, Albarran said.

Eventually, an LAPD SWAT unit was called to the scene. Officers heard one gunshot as they were setting up, Albarran said. About 30 minutes after the gunshot SWAT officers found Vasquez dead from a self-inflicted wound.

A weapon was recovered at the scene.

Traffic on Burbank Boulevard from Vineland Avenue to Cahuenga Boulevard was blocked for about three hours during the standoff and the follow-up investigation, Albarran said.
