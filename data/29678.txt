REXBURG — A person is dead following an officer-involved shooting Monday evening.

Police were called to an apartment complex at 8:11 p.m. for a report of an unwanted subject, according to Rexburg Assistant Police Chief Gary Hagen. Neighbors say the incident unfolded at North Brenchley Apartments at 430 South 3rd West.

“Two officers made contact with the subject and shortly after shots were fired,” Hagen tells EastIdahoNews.com. “It’s unclear what led up to the shots being fired. The subject, a 50-year-old Rexburg resident, was pronounced dead on the scene.”

The officers were not injured and have been placed on administrative leave.

The shooting is now being investigated by the Critical Incident Task Force, which consists of detectives from different eastern Idaho law enforcement agencies. Officers were still on the scene as of 1:30 a.m. Tuesday.
