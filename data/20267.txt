The death of Cupps has been ruled a homicide. The Iowa State Medical Examiner has determined Cupps died from heart failure, brought on by recent amphetamine use.

His death has been ruled a homicide, but that’s largely because medical examiners have just a few categories that they can put deaths into.

Because another person was involved in Cupps’ death, it fits the bill of a homicide.

The case has been turned over to the Dubuque County Attorney, who will determine whether any charges will be filed.
