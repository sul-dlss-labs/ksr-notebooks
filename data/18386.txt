LOGANVILLE, GA â€” A Loganville woman was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies Thursday after authorities say she pointed a gun at the officers.

Walton County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to a call Thursday morning to find Rita King, 56, with two guns in her possession, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

Officers gave verbal commands for her to drop the weapons, but she did not comply, according to the GBI. King then pointed a gun toward the officers, at which time they fired multiple rounds, striking and killing her.
