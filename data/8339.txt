Guillermo Saucedo, a 23-year-old Latino, was shot several times by deputies and died Friday, August 7, in the 12700 block of Waldorf Drive in Lynwood, according to Los Angeles County coroner's officials.

Saucedo allegedly pulled a gun on sheriff’s officials as they were trying to disperse a house party in Lynwood and was shot and killed by deputies, a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman said.

Deputies arrived at the house in the 12700 block of Waldorf Drive about 11:30 p.m. and were ushering out guests when the suspect “made a furtive movement and began walking away from the deputies,” the Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.

As the deputies tried to catch up to Saucedo, he pulled out a handgun, the statement said.
