Ozark police have released an initial report and the identity of a man killed in an officer-involved shooting Monday.

Ozark Police Department officials say the initial report shows the shooting of 83-year-old Earl Morrow was justified.

Police say the shooting happened on the corner of Deer Avenue and East College Street. They say it started when Morrow threatened his neighbors with a gun.

Officers say they ordered Morrow to put down his gun, but he pointed his pistol at an investigator. That's when the officer opened fire striking Morrow several times.

Morrow was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Family members reportedly told police that Morrow possibly suffered from dementia.



The officer is currently on paid administrative leave. His name hasn't been released, but we're told he is a supervisor in the police department's criminal investigation division and is an 11-year veteran of the department.

Police Chief Tony Spivey said he believes the findings will be presented to a grand jury.

The officer must also undergo psychiatric treatment before returning to work.
