Police continue their investigation into her death, but Richardson police spokesman Sgt. Kevin Perlich says "it's possible she wasn't stopping" for officers "because she had several outstanding warrants for her arrest," including in Dallas County, where, records show, she was indicted in April for possessing between one to four grams of cocaine. Perlich says she also has outstanding felony narcotics warrants in Smith County.

, Sgt. Kevin Perlich, a spokesman with the Richardson Police Department, said the woman was killed by a single bullet fired by a Richardson officer who feared for his life.

Contrary to earlier reports, said Perlich, the woman behind the wheel of the Lexus "made contact with an officer standing in the roadway" after she fled from two other Richardson officers attempting a traffic stop. The officer wasn't hurt, said Perlich, "however the officer, in fear for his life, fired upon the vehicle." The car traveled a short distance, said Perlich, then crashed into a guardrail.

Perlich said the incident began around 8:30 this morning, near the 600 block of Belt Line Road. Perlich said an officer was "attempting to get a violator to pull over into a parking lot" -- most likely for speeding, he said, but the reason remains unclear. But the woman kept on driving, and the officer put out a description of the car and driver over the radio.

Shortly after that, Perlich said, an officer in a squad car saw the vehicle and attempted his own stop. Once again, she refused to pull over and kept driving through a residential area near N. Central Expressway. She turned to go east on

and headed for the frontage road to southbound N. Central Expressway.

There, said Perlich, "a third officer near Dumont and the frontage road was working a traffic accident. He stepped out into the road and tried to get her to stop." Instead, he says, the woman accelerated and clipped the officer, who, Perlich says, fired the single shot that struck the woman who has yet to be identified.

When asked if she was killed from the gunshot, Perlich said, "From what we can tell, yes."

She was taken to Medical City Dallas, where she was pronounced dead. Perlich said it's not clear where the bullet struck her.

Perlich said two investigations -- one criminal, one administrative -- will now take place "to make sure the shooting was within the law and within policy." The officer will be put on leave during the investigation.
