25-year-old Jonica J. Walker. of DeKalb, was killed late Saturday night after a police chase when her car hit a tree.

Around 11:30 p.m., DeKalb Police officers were called to investigate the possibility of shots being fired in the area of 1000 Hillcrest.

While officers were patrolling a nearby parking lot, they saw a dark colored SUV speed off as a man chased after the vehicle on foot.

The man yelled for police to stop the vehicle, but police say that, when the officer asked why, the man did not respond.

The officer chased the vehicle but was unable to catch up with it, and police say the chase was terminated after the vehicle blew through the intersection of Hillcrest and Normal Roads at a high rate of speed.

A short time later, the vehicle was located in the 500 block of Hillcrest, where it had left the road and hit a tree.

Walker was pronounced dead at the scene.
