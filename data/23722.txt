Louis F. Williams of Walden died on the scene of the crash which took place around 8:32 a.m., Tuesday, in the Town of Montgomery, when he failed to stop for a Town of Crawford police officer who was attempting to stop him, said Trooper Steven Nevel.

After failing to stop for the officer, Williams' vehicle appeared to lose control while rounding a curve in the roadway, entered into the westbound lane, and struck an oncoming vehicle, Nevel said.

Williams was pronounced deceased at the scene, he added.

The driver of the westbound vehicle was airlifted to Westchester Medical Center with injuries to his neck and legs. The Town of Crawford police officer was not involved in the collision, Nevel said.

The investigation remains ongoing and the State Police are asking anyone with information to please contact the Montgomery barracks at 845-457-1388.
