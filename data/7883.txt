A Cook County jury on Friday awarded $2.75 million to the family of an 18-year-old man who was killed in a Chicago police car chase in the Humboldt Park neighborhood in 2009.

Keith MacNiece, known as Tito, died Feb. 20, 2009 after a 12-minute police chase that started with a stop-sign violation. The chase was “unauthorized and prohibited,” and reached speeds up to 100 miles per hour, said Jon Loevy, one of the attorneys representing the family in its lawsuit against the city of Chicago.

Two other people — the driver, and a 13-year-old girl — were in the car with MacNiece, who was sitting in the back seat.

Police began to chase the car after the driver did not stop at a stop sign, and the chase ended after the car crashed into some light poles on Sacramento Avenue, Grusin said. MacNiece was taken to an area hospital where he died about 10 days later, said Sarah Grusin, who also represented MacNiece’s family.

“Today justice was done,” Loevy said. Jurors “decided that Tito should not have met the fate that he met and that his family was entitled to compensation for the terrible loss.”

Jondalyn Fields, MacNiece’s mother, who left the courtroom with her three children, her father, and sister, said she felt that her son received justice.

“No amount of money will ever bring my son back, but I just feel relief that there is justice for him at this point,” Jondalyn Fields said.

Percy Fields, MacNiece’s grandfather, said his grandson was a fun-loving and caring person who took care of his four younger brothers. The dedicated grandfather has tracked the time since his oldest grandchild died; on Friday, he noted, it had been 2,378 days.

MacNiece always helped his mom and enjoyed waking up early in the morning to cook her breakfast, especially on Mother’s Day. He was “a fun kid to have around,” Percy Fields said.

“I lost the smile on my daughter when I lost my grandson,” Percy Fields said. “We all miss him very much.”
