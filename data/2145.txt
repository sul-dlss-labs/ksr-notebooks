Tift County-- The chase started in Crisp County, went through Turner County, and had a deadly ending in Tift County.

Turner County deputies tried to stop the man with stop sticks, but he sped around them forcing them to use an alternative maneuver.

The driver of the car was wanted for a gas drive off. He sped away from the Williams travel Center in Cordele, after failing to pay for $10.69 of gasoline for his Honda Civic.

The chase covered almost 30 miles before a Turner County Deputy in an unmarked car used the PIT maneuver to get the Honda stopped. The car crashed into a retaining wall, ejecting the driver.

The State Patrol's Crash Reconstruction team is working the accident, and has not released the driver's name. Authorities felt they were forced to get the car stopped before it entered a very congested one-lane area of the Interstate, where many construction workers would have been exposed to the danger.
