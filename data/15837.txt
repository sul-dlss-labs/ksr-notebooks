A Sylacauga man wanted on nearly a dozen outstanding bad check charges died early this morning during a police chase in northern Jefferson County.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the man as Terence Deon Welch. He was 34.

The chase began about 12:30 a.m. when an Alabama state trooper tried to stop Welch along Interstate 65 northbound near Walker Chapel Road in Fultondale. He sped off, and the pursuit began, Trooper Chuck Daniel said in an earlier interview.

Welch exited onto U.S. 31 and drove into Warrior, where he crashed at Highway 31 and Fifth Street. The crash happened at 12:45 a.m. Welch wasn't wearing a seat belt, and was thrown from his vehicle.

Blount County EMS responded to the scene and began transport to UAB Hospital. Welch, however, died en route and was pronounced dead at 1:20 a.m.

Troopers are expected to release additional information today. It wasn't immediately clear why they were trying to pull over Welch.

Welch was wanted on failure to appear in court in Talladega County on 11 charges of negotiating a worthless instrument, or bad checks. Just last month, he was charged with third-degree domestic violence, and was currently out of jail on $1,500 bond, court records show.

He pleaded guilty in 2003 to second-degree assault and was sentenced to three years in prison. The following year he pleaded guilty to an escape charge and received a 321-day sentence. Records show he escaped, or tried to escape, from the Talladega City Jail.

He is believed to have been released from prison in 2005 after completing his sentence.
