ANAHEIM – Police on Wednesday released the identity of a man who was shot and killed by an off-duty police officer following an attack at a Del Taco restaurant.

Charles Allen Barrera, 39, of Anaheim, was shot in the abdomen and died shortly after arriving at a hospital Sunday afternoon, police said.

The off-duty officer, who has been with the Gardena Police Department for 10 years, was leaving the restaurant with his 6-year-old daughter when he was attacked by Barrera, police said.

Anaheim police Sgt. Rick Martinez said the man was “highly agitated” and was using profanities before the attack, which occurred at 3:45 p.m. at the Del Taco on the corner of Lincoln Avenue and Rio Vista Street.

Martinez said he didn’t know what led to the attack, but the officer fired his weapon and shot the man outside the east entrance.

Martinez said the officer’s daughter stayed inside the restaurant and was not injured.

The officer suffered a broken rib and had injuries to his nose, jaw and face resulting in some cuts and swelling.

Barrera had an extensive criminal history dating back to 1995, which includes convictions for attempted robbery, driving under the influence of alcohol, disobeying domestic relations court orders on several occasions and traffic violations, according to court records.

Anaheim detectives are investigating the shooting.
