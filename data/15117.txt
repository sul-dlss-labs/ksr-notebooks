A Jackson county jury found an Independence man guilty of felony murder and nine other felony counts in connection with a 2014 fatal crash near 31st & Grand Avenue.

Drew M. Ryland, 27, was found guilty Friday night of murder in the 2nd degree, resisting arrest, five counts of armed criminal action and three counts of assault in the 2nd degree.

Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker says shortly after midnight on September 9, 2014 police officers observed a white SUV speeding on Southwest Trafficway.

The officers began a pursuit with lights and sirens, but discontinued the chase at Broadway.

A few minutes later the SUV crashed head on into a 2006 Dodge Charger at 31st & Broadway.

Two occupants of the Dodge Charger and three occupants of the suburban were transported to area hospitals with serious injuries.

Michael Hernandez died in the crash.

The suburban's crash data recorder showed Ryland traveling 81 mph in the 35 mph zone. His blood alcohol content was .145 after the crash.

Sentencing for Ryland has been set for May 26, at 9 a.m.
