A suicidal man died after state police shot him Wednesday on the Route 33 overpass above Interstate 80, shutting down Route 33 for hours.

Christian Hall, 19, of Stroudsburg, died from injuries at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Pocono in East Stroudsburg after the incident that began at 1:38 p.m. on the overpass in Hamilton Township.

According to state police:

State troopers responded to a call about a suicidal man, later identified as Hall, on the overpass and found him standing with a gun near the bridge.

Troopers began speaking with Hall and ordered him to put the gun on the ground, which he did.

As police continued speaking with him, he picked the gun back up and began walking toward the troopers. He pointed the gun in their direction, and they shot him.

Troopers immediately began providing medical assistance to Hall until an ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Route 33 and I-80 were shut down during the incident. I-80 reopened just before 3:30 p.m., while Route 33 remained closed until about 9 p.m.

The Monroe County district attorneyâ€™s office and state police are investigating.
