The Okeechobee County Sheriff's Office says an armed man involved in a domestic violence situation was fatally shot by Deputies Monday night.

Sheriff Noel E. Stephen says Deputies responded to a domestic violence situation where a man armed himself and fled. A low-speed chase ensued to another location, where the armed man held a gun to his own head.

According to Sheriff Stephen, at one point the armed man approached Deputies while still armed and Deputies fired "less than lethal" rounds at him, attempting to stop his advancement towards them.

Those efforts were unsuccessful and Deputies fired lethal rounds at the man, killing him.
