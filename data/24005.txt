Deputies were called to the home, located in the 500 block of Highway East Loop 1604 near Pleasanton Road, around 5:15 a.m. They found a woman had suffered gunshot wounds to the neck and chest.

After discovering the woman, believed to be in her 50s, deputies began to search for the gunman, who is believed to be in his 30s.

The unidentified man later popped out of a nearby wooded area and drew a weapon.

“He was armed with a weapon and deputies did order him to drop the weapon several times. That suspect failed to comply and deputies opened fire on the suspect,” Sheriff Javier Salazar said.

BCSO officials said the incident between the man and the woman is believed to a family disturbance and investigators are working to determine the relationship between them.
