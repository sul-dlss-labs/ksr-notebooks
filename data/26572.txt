WEST LAFAYETTE â€” Deputies arrived in the 3000 block of Jasmine Court about 5:50 p.m. Saturday to investigate a 911 text reporting a domestic disturbance between Kameron McCreery and Rachel McCreery.

It was the start of a standoff that lasted for several hours in the neighborhood west of Klondike Road and south of U.S. 52, according to the sheriff's office.

While deputies were inside the house investigating the initial report, Kameron McCreery was in the basement and fired shots through the floor near the deputies, according to the sheriff's office.

Rachel McCreery and her two children, along with the deputies, safely made it out of the house, according to the sheriff's office and Tippecanoe County Coroner Donna Avolt.

A perimeter was set up around the McCreery's house, and the sheriff's office SWAT team members surrounded the area. Negotiators tried calling Kameron McCreery's cellphone, but he didn't answer, according to the sheriff's office.

After unsuccessful attempts to reach Kameron McCreery by his phone, deputies placed a phone with a direct line to negotiators inside the house, but Kameron McCreery still didn't respond.

Deputies also sent a robot into the house in an attempt to find Kameron McCreery, but they were unsuccessful.

With no other choices left, deputies on the SWAT team entered the house.

They found Kameron McCreery dead in the basement. They suspect he shot himself, according to the news release.

Avolt said an autopsy will be performed early this week to determine the manner of death.

No deputies were injured in the standoff, according to the news release.
