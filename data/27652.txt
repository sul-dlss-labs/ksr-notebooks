SOUTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) â€“ A violent and deadly scene unfolded in Southwest Miami-Dade early Tuesday morning involving an armed man who attacked his daughter-in-law with a knife and a police involved shooting. In the end, both the attacker and his victim were killed.

It all started when police went to the Americana Village home in the 19800 block of SW 180th Avenue following reports of a stabbing.

A woman, outside of the home with a toddler, told arriving officers her husband, Jose Gainza, 49, stabbed their daughter-in-law inside of the house.

That daughter-in-law is 27-year-old Ana Iris Rodriguez Reyes.

Fearing for her safety, police say officers entered the home and witnessed Gainza run into a bedroom where he refused to come out or put the knife down.

"Once they went into the house, they observed this armed subject running to one of the bedrooms and barricading himself," explained Miami-Dade Police Department spokesman Alvaro Zabaleta.

It wasn't long after that when the Miami-Dade Police Special Response Team arrived and were forced to fire after Gainza confronted police.

"The armed subject then confronted the Special Response Team officers. Shots were fired. Once Miami-Dade Fire Rescue entered, they were the ones that pronounced not only the subject, but unfortunately the victim deceased on the scene," said Zabaleta.

Reyes was found unconscious in another bedroom where she died from apparent stab wounds.
