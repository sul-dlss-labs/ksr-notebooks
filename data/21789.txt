Todd Gregory Hurlburt, a 53-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police Friday, Aug. 4, in the 800 block of Venice Boulevard in Venice, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Officers responded about 8:30 p.m. to a call to “keep the peace” and met a woman outside a home who said that Hurlburt, her boyfriend, was inside destroying her “personal property,” according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department.

As officers walked into the home, they saw Hurlburt sitting in a chair across the room with his back to the officers with a rifle in his hand, according to a news release from the department.

“Mr. Hurlburt ignored verbal commands from the officers to drop the rifle,” according to a news release from Aug. 29. “He stood up and turned in their direction with the rifle,” prompting the police shooting, according to the news release.

Hurlburt was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:33 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

No officers were injured, and a AR-15 rifle was recovered at the scene.
