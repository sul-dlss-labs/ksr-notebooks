DeKALB – A DeKalb police officer fatally shot a man Monday morning after officers responded to a domestic violence call, according to a Monday DeKalb Police Department news release.

The officer who fired the gun has been placed on administrative duty, a standard procedure following use of force incidents, according to the news release. The Illinois State Police are investigating the use of force.

Police Chief David Byrd identified the man Wednesday as 33-year-old Kristopher Kramer.

DeKalb Police responded to a domestic disturbance at 2:45 a.m. Monday in the 100 Block of Tilton Park Drive after receiving a call from a female who advised officers of the disturbance. The female said that Kramer in the residence had been drinking an alcoholic beverage and was armed with a “samurai sword,” threatening to kill the female and attack officers, according to police.

The female told officers that Kramer “was a danger to himself and had self-inflicted wounds to his wrist,” according to the news release. When the police arrived on the scene, they spoke to Kramer for several minutes, attempting to de-escalate the situation and convince Kramer to open the door to the residence. However, Kramer grabbed the sword, and advanced towards the officer with the weapon over his head, and pointed it at the police, according to the news release.

The police ordered Kramer to drop the sword, but he refused, according to police. Officers then used a taser and a bean bag projectile, and one officer fired one round from a departmental firearm striking Kramer in the upper torso, according to the news release.

The DeKalb Police Department was assisted by the NIU Police Department, DeKalb County Sheriff’s Office, DeKalb Fire Department and the Illinois State Police.
