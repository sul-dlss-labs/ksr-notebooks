Mesquite and Forney police and Dallas County sheriff's deputies chased the suspect vehicle into Dallas, where the two women jumped out and were arrested, Geron said.

The man, identified as 36-year-old Gary Wayne Jones, kept driving to the 1100 block of Riverwood Road where police say he got out and started shooting, striking a Forney squad car. Officers from Mesquite and Forney returned fire and killed Jones. There were no other injuries.

Dallas police are investigating the shooting.

A woman at the scene identified herself as Jones' estranged wife. Amy Jones said she never knew him to carry a gun during their 16 years of marriage.

"He never owned a gun," said Amy Jones, who was separated from Jones but has two sons, ages 7 and 10, with him. "I just don't understand this."

But Dallas County court records show Jones had once pleaded guilty to possession of a prohibited weapon. He had also been convicted of burglary of a vehicle, evading arrest and drug possession.
