Police have identified the stabbing suspect who was shot and killed by a Takoma Park officer during a struggle Saturday as 19-year-old Keston David Lewis, authorities said Tuesday. Lewis, of Odenton, had already been zapped with a Taser and was fighting with Takoma Park Police Officer Mary Jo Walpole when another Takoma Park officer, Cpl. Keith Largent, shot and killed him, police said.

The shooting brought to an end a violent incident that police said began just before 4 p.m. Saturday, when Lewis tried to take a man's car at the Sunoco gas station in the 6900 block of New Hampshire Avenue. The man, police said, confronted Lewis, and Lewis stabbed him before speeding out of the gas station in a Ford Focus.

The man was critically wounded but survived, police said.

Takoma Park police officers tried to chase Lewis but lost sight of him, police said. They soon found, however, that he had flipped his Focus after crashing into three other vehicles near Riggs Road and Metzerot Road, police said.

At some point, police said, Lewis tried to carjack a woman driving a red BMW who stopped to assist those involved in the crash, and a man came to her aid. Police said Tuesday they were looking for both the man and the woman, whom they described as “Good Samaritans.”

Police said Walpole shot Lewis with a Taser, but it did not stop him. Lewis then assaulted Walpole, and Largent shot and killed him after he ignored officers’ demands to stop, police said.

Both Walpole and Largent have been placed on administrative leave while detectives investigate the incident — standard procedure for police-involved shootings. Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Homicide Unit at (301) 772-4925.
