DETROIT â€“ Detroit police confirm to Local 4 that an out-of-town off-duty border patrol agent has been involved in a fatal shooting on the city's east side.

The incident happened around 2 a.m. Monday on Westphalia Street, which is near McNicols Road and Schoenherr Street.

Sources said a verbal argument took place during a card game, where the agent and his cousin were present - and a man left the house and came back with a gun.

When the man brandished the gun, police said the agent fired his gun several times, killing the man.

"I didn't just hear one or two shots. There was a lot of gun fire," said Immanuel Williams, who lives on Westphalia Street. "I was asleep at the time and it woke me right up."

Deputy Chief Rodney Johnson said the agent was in town from California visiting family.
