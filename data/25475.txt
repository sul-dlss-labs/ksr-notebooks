Alan Machael Dixon’s loved ones cried quietly in the back of a courtroom at the Spartanburg County Detention Center on Wednesday during the 21-year-old’s bond hearing.

Dixon faces charges in connection with a five-vehicle wreck Tuesday night near WestGate Mall that left 50-year-old Thomas Michael Delise dead.

At the bond hearing Wednesday, 7th Circuit Solicitor Barry Barnette said Dixon led Spartanburg County deputies on a 12-mile chase that ended with the fatal wreck. Dixon later told investigators he was racing when deputies tried to pull him over, Barnette said.

Spartanburg County Magistrate Judge Daniel Burns denied Dixon’s bond Wednesday. His bond will be determined by a Circuit Court judge at a later date.

Dixon, 21, faces charges of hit-and-run resulting in death; blue light violation resulting in death; acquiescing in racing; hit-and-run with property damage to attended vehicle; and malicious injury to personal property, value greater than $10,000.

Barnette said more charges are pending.

At 8:48 p.m. Tuesday, a 2012 Volkswagen Beetle traveling west on East Blackstock Road hit a 2015 Mazda that was traveling south on U.S. Highway 29, according to S.C. Highway Patrol Trooper Joe Hovis. The Mazda, driven by Delise, then hit a 2014 Honda traveling east on East Blackstock, as well as a 2015 Ford and 2001 Lexus that were traveling south on Highway 29.

Delise was trapped in the car and was removed from the vehicle mechanically, Hovis said. The 21-year-old driver of the Lexus was injured during the wreck and taken by EMS to Spartanburg Medical Center.

Dixon, who authorities said was driving the Volkswagen, was also taken to Spartanburg Medical after the wreck and later released. He was booked at 11:40 p.m. Tuesday at the Spartanburg County Detention Center.

Highway Patrol and the Spartanburg County Coroner’s Office are investigating the wreck.
