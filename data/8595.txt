CORINTH, Miss. -- Police say a woman was killed and a man injured after they were ejected from their vehicle following a high speed chase that began with the robbery of a Corinth bank.

The first officers on the scene at a branch of SouthBank reported shots fired as a vehicle allegedly attempted to run them over while leaving the parking lot around 4:30 p.m. Tuesday.

Police say the robbery sparked a pursuit which ended when the suspects lost control of their sport-utility vehicle on U.S. Highway 72 near Iuka. The vehicle rolled at least once, coming to rest on its roof and ejecting both occupants.

The Highway Patrol says Vida Byrd of Tuscumbia, Ala., was pronounced dead at the scene. Asa Nakeen Warren, also of Tuscumbia, was sent to a Tupelo hopsital, where his condition was not known.
