The California Highway Patrol shot and killed a suspect on the eastbound 60 Freeway in Montebello on Monday night, the agency said, a man accused of assault with a deadly weapon and following within 300 feet of an emergency vehicle.

The CHP did not say how many officers opened fire and didn’t release details on what led to the fatal shooting, which the agency originally said occurred in Monterey Park.

Caltrans is repaving the 60 Freeway between the 710 and 605 freeways. A contractor for Caltrans was working Monday night on that stretch with a CHP escort, Caltrans spokesman Eric Menjivar said.

Shortly after 8:20 p.m., a unit from the East L.A. CHP office asked for additional units to help with a traffic stop on the freeway, west of Paramount Boulevard, the statement said.

There were two officers at the scene, said CHP spokeswoman Amber Wright, adding she didn’t know if both were involved in the shooting.

“During the course of the traffic stop, the motorist failed to comply with commands and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” according to the statement.

Officers started CPR. Arriving paramedics took over. The suspect died at the scene.

The CHP asked another agency to investigate the shooting but that department declined, Wright said.

Spokespersons for the Montebello police, Monterey Park police and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said their agencies were not asked.

The CHP Critical Incident Investigation Team, Investigative Services Unit and Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Team are handling the investigation.
