NEWARK — An armed man shot and killed by Newark police officers on Tuesday evening has been identified by the Essex County Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating the incident along with city police.

Marvin Coleman, 19, was shot by at least two officers after he brandished a weapon and used it to hit one of the officers in the face following a brief foot chase near the South Ward intersection of Freylinghuysen Avenue and Whittier Place, a press release from acting Prosecutor Carolyn Murray’s office said yesterday.

City Police Director Samuel DeMaio has said the weapon was a handgun. The officers, from the nearby Fifth Precinct, were not identified.

Officers were approaching a group of people gathered on the corner of Freylinghuysen and Foster Street about 7:40 p.m. when they noticed one of the group adjust what looked appeared to be a weapon in his waistband, police said Tuesday night.

As officers tried to apprehend the man, later identified as Coleman, he turned around, drew the weapon and struck an officer in the face, according to the prosecutor’s account.

"Both officers then fired an undetermined amount of times," police Director Samuel DeMaio said Tuesday night.

The prosecutor’s homicide/major crimes task force and professional standards bureau is investigating.
