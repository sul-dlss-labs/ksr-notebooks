Officers Arturo Dominguez and Steven Martinez are assigned to the Gang Unit and were assigned to patrol the 22 section because of a recent increase in gang related shootings. They initiated a traffic stop on an Infiniti Sedan (TXLP FZH9895) in the 900 block of Mariposa. The vehicle was occupied by two males. The violations were no seatbelt by driver and failure to signal a right turn.

Both officers smelled marijuana when they approached the vehicle. Officer Martinez saw the front passenger drinking a "Big Gulp" and it appeared that he had swallowed something. The driver confirmed that the passenger had swallowed some type of drug. Officer Martinez handled the passenger (Carlos Mata) and Officer Dominguez handled the driver (Michael Palafos).

Both males were asked to get out of the vehicle and handcuffed. When the passenger got out of the vehicle Officer Martinez could see marijuana and a white powdery substance in a baggie that had apparently been bitten. The driver was placed in a patrol car and the passenger was sat on the curb line. Officer Martinez noticed that the passenger started looking "glazed over". He went to the passenger and moved him to the front of the patrol car to attempt to help him. The passenger started "dry heaving" and spitting up and suddenly collapsed.

Officer Martinez called for EMS. Officer Martinez assisted the passenger to the ground and the

passenger started thrashing about on the pavement. Officer Martinez then moved him to the grassy area and removed his handcuffs. Officer Martinez placed the passenger on his side to prevent him from choking on his own vomit. EMS arrived and started treatment on the passenger. The passenger was transported to Metropolitan Methodist Hospital for treatment and he died in the emergency room. He was pronounced deceased by Dr. Matthew Boyland at 0105 hours 08/07/2015. The hospital tested Matas blood and the preliminary test was positive for methamphetamine.
