A man shot to death by police in Tujunga after he allegedly threatened them with a knife was identified Monday.

Jairo Pedraza, 24, of Los Angeles, was shot in the 6400 block of Olcott Street about 3:35 p.m. Friday, according to Los Angeles police and a coroner’s spokesman.

Officers were sent to the 900 block of Breidt Avenue on a report of an attempted suicide. When they arrived, police said, they were confronted by Pedraza, who was armed with a knife, and the officers tried to subdue him with a stun gun.

“It didn’t work,” Officer Nuria Vanegas said. “He ran to a nearby backyard, where he confronted the officers with (the) knife.”

Vanegas said police then opened fire.
