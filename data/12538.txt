HEBBRONVILLE (March 29, 2013)—Authorities Friday identified the Central Texas man who died in a gun battle with U.S. Border Patrol agents earlier this month after he was caught with a car stolen in Waco .

Matthew Simmons, 27, who is believed to be from Bosque County, died March 21 in a gun fight with three border patrol agents, one of whom was wounded.

The injured agent has since been released from a Corpus Christi hospital and is at home recovering, a USBP spokeswoman said Friday.

U.S. Border Patrol press liaison Efrain Perez said the agents were on patrol on March 21 in the area of Farm-to-Market Road 649 and Chihuahua Road, just south of Hebbronville, when they spotted a car on the side of the road that appeared to have been involved in an accident.

Perez said agents pulled up to the car, a gray 2010 Honda Civic, and began talking with a man identified as Simmons who was standing beside it.

One of the agents checked the car’s license plate and determined the vehicle had been stolen in Waco.

Perez said Simmons died after he pulled a handgun on the three agents, shot one of them in the hip and then was shot himself.
