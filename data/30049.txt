FRUITLAND PARK — The Lake County Sheriff’s Office has recovered the body of a man who was involved in an accident shortly after midnight Thursday, then jumped off the Picciola Road bridge and drowned.

The sheriff’s dive team found the remains of 23-year-old Ojay Cummings in Lake Griffin at about 12:30 p.m.

Cummings had rear-ended a car driven by a man, who was with his wife, according to Fruitland Park Chief Erik Luce.

“There was an argument and he took a swipe at her phone, then ran when the husband called 911,” Luce said.

The Fruitland Park police officer responding to the call drove up about a minute later and saw Cummings jump off the bridge.

Officers searched for the man for a while, with the help of the sheriff’s drone unit, then had to call it off because of darkness.

The car was not stolen. It belonged to someone else, but the owner was aware that Cummings had it.

There was no chase. Nor, apparently, were there any warrants out for Cummings' arrest.

“Nobody has any idea why he did it, other than possibly intoxication,” Luce said.

The Medical Examiner’s Office will conduct an autopsy.

The woman captured the argument on cell phone video, “but it was not that bad,” Luce said.

However, a check with the clerk of court’s records show that prosecutors had two open felony cases against him in 2020, for fleeing or attempting to elude law enforcement and resisting without violence, and another for grand theft of a firearm.

In 2019, he was placed on probation for racing and possession of more than 20 grams of marijuana.

In another misdemeanor case, he was placed on probation for carrying a concealed weapon and possession of cannabis with intent to sell, so he may have been afraid of being charged with violating the terms of his probation.

LCSO is conducting a death investigation, according to Lt. John Herrell.
