RALEIGH, N.C. — A wrongful death lawsuit that a family filed against the Raleigh Police Department moved on to federal court on Thursday. The family of Soheil Antonio Mojarrad, 30, is suing the department after Mojarrad was shot and killed by police.

Police say Mojarrad had a knife he refused to put down during an arrest.

The family joined with protesters over the past couple months who have been demanding change in the Raleigh Police Department.

The officer who shot Mojarrad has since been cleared by the department and the district attorney and is working again.

"It’s a pain and heartache I live with every day," Judy Mojarrad said of her son's death. "There’s days when I drive into work, and I cry all the way there, [then] pull myself together to do my job as an RN. I would not wish this on anybody."

The family is suing Cassandra Deck-Brown, Officer W.B. Edwards, City Manager Ruffin Hall and the City of Raleigh, alleging civil rights violations, negligence, assault and battery and wrongful death. They are seeking unspecified damages.

Officer Edwards shot and killed Mojarrad in a shopping center parking lot in east Raleigh on April 20, 2019. Edwards fired 11 shots at Mojarrad, stopping to reload before firing again, hitting him eight times, according to the lawsuit. A knife was found in Mojarrad's open palm as he lay dead on the ground, but the State Crime Lab found no DNA or fingerprints on it, according to the lawsuit.

The family's attorney said he was at least 20 feet away when he was shot and killed.

Mojarrad suffered from mental health issues after being hit bt a vehicle in 2012. The lawsuit faults the department's training as "woefully inadequate," especially in terms of handling encounters with mentally ill people.

Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman cleared Edwards of any wrongdoing last fall, saying there wasn't enough evidence of any criminal wrongdoing to pursue a case against him.
