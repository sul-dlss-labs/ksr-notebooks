STOCKTON - The 18-year-old Stockton man killed in a crash following a carjacking and a short chase by police was identified as Lorenzo Ray Serna, the Coroner's Office reported Thursday.

The Police Department has said Serna carjacked the driver of a 2001 Jaguar around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday near American Street and Miner Avenue. Officers passing through were flagged down by the car's owner and joined the chase when the car was spotted.

Police said Serna turned the wrong way down Park Street and accelerated, eventually losing control and crashing into a tree. He died at the scene.

Police said Thursday that a firearm and ammunition were recovered from the wreckage of the Jaguar.

Serna had been documented as a gang member by police in Stockton.
