OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- An Oklahoma City police officer remained on paid administrative lead Monday after fatally shooting a man over the weekend.



Police say Lieutenant Steve Whitson, a 13-year veteran of the police department, shot and killed 30-year-old Dermico Deon Wright on Saturday night on the city's southwest side.



Wright was a suspect in an earlier shooting at an Oklahoma City nightclub that left two people injured. Ronald Chad Gruver and Aviance Gardner were shot Saturday in the parking lot of the Centerfolds Club, where both victims worked.



Police say Whitson located Wright a few blocks from where the shooting took place and attempted to take him into custody. But police say Wright aggressively approached Whitson and disregarded verbal commands.
