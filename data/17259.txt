LANCASTER – A 45-year-old man was shot to death by sheriff’s deputies in Lancaster after he walked toward them carrying an ax that he had previously used to try to kill a neighbor, authorities said.

It happened around 6:45 p.m. Thursday, Feb. 11, outside a home on the 2800 block of La Vida Drive in Lancaster, according to a news release by the Sheriff’s Information Bureau.

Deputies responded to the area after a report that an ax-wielding man had gotten into an argument with a neighbor.

“The suspect, a male white 45 years old, had an ax, swung it at his neighbor several times, and threatened to kill him,” sheriff’s officials said in the news release.

When the deputies arrived, the man was standing outside on his front lawn holding the ax. The man then walked toward the deputies, who ordered him to drop the weapon, which he allegedly refused to do, according to the sheriff’s department.

“One of the deputies fired several rounds at him from a stun bag shotgun, but it did not affect the suspect. The suspect raised the ax up so it was partially above his head and walked toward the deputies. The deputies then shot the suspect,” the sheriff’s news release states.

Paramedics rushed the man to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead. His name has been withheld pending family notification.

The shooting is being investigated by the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau, the Internal Affairs Bureau, the Office of the Inspector General and the L.A. County District Attorney’s Justice System Integrity Division.
