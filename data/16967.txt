The aftermath of one fatal car accident has left two communities mourning.

Vanessa Zamora, a 33-year-old Modesto woman, and Jeremy Fielder, a Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Sergeant both died after their cars crashed head on around 8:00 Friday night in Hughson.

CHP officials say Zamora was heading southbound on Santa Fe Road, just south of Ledom Road, when her car swerved into the northbound lane, hitting Fielder’s car. The CHP says it has yet to determine what caused Zamora to lose control, killing them both and sending Fielder’s wife to the hospital.

The pain from their loss is palpable according to those who knew both victims.

Sam Pierstorff, and a few of Zamora’s other close friends met Saturday night to reflect.

“If you cut Vanessa I think she’d bleed light. She just absolutely lit up a room, with her intellect and her defiant attitude,” said Pierstorff.

They describe Zamora as a Cal Berkeley grad, a mom of an 8-year-old son, local baker and someone it was impossible not to like.

“I know everybody says it. Everybody who passed away was the greatest person on earth but, something about Vanessa was pretty special,” Pierstorff said.

“This is a tragic loss for us,” said Stanislaus Sheriff Adam Christianson.

Sergeant Fielder was a 20 year veteran of the department. Christianson spent the day with the Fielder family, picking up those who came from out of town and bringing them to the Sutter Memorial Hospital in Modesto.

“it’s difficult it’s a tough time of year, it’s difficult to get through,” Christianson said.

As CHP investigators find more answers as to what caused the crash, loved ones try to find their own about how to deal with it.

The CHP still must determine the speed with which both cars were driving, and whether drugs or alcohol were a factor in the crash.
