Tucson police identified the robbery suspect shot by an officer Friday afternoon as 38-year-old Dennis Riley.

Police responded to reports of two aggravated assaults and an armed robbery involving the same suspect near North First Avenue and East Roger Road Friday afternoon and began a search for the man which eventually lead them to the 700 block of East McMillan Drive where they found Riley holding a handgun, Sgt. Maria Hawke, a Tucson police spokeswoman said in a news release.

Riley dropped the gun after being told repeatedly to put the weapon down, the release said.

Officer Aron Lodermeier deployed a pepperball toward Riley when he refused to move away from the gun, the release said.

Riley then picked up the gun again, held it up and faced the officers, moving the gun toward them, the release said. Riley did not comply with orders to put the gun down and Officer Todd Schladweiler, fired at him striking him, the release said.

Riley was taken to the hospital where he died.
