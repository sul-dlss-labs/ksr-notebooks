BEDFORD, OH (WOIO) - say the cop accused of shooting and killing a knife-wielding man on December 26 is Officer Kevin Webb.

Webb is a 15-year veteran of law enforcement, and has been with the Bedford Police Dept. for the last eight years.



The deadly shooting happened the day after Christmas in the 600 block of Archer Road.



Officers responded to the residence after a woman called 911 saying her boyfriend came home drunk and started destroying Christmas decorations.

When they arrived officers say John Hebebrand, 43, admitted to having a weapon and kept reaching behind his back. In response, police say Hebebrand was first tased. According to police, the taser was ineffective and he brandished a knife as he moved toward the officers.

That's when Officer Webb shot Hebebrand. Hebebrand was transported to MetroHealth Medical Center, where he died from his wounds.

Officer Webb responded according to his training and was forced to fire his duty weapon to protect himself and his fellow officers. There were multiple shots fired and the victim was struck multiple times. The investigation is ongoing. At the conclusion of the investigation, the case will be presented to the Grand Jury by the Cuyahoga County Prosecutor's Office.
