A father and son from Georgia and Florida were two of the four victims of Monday’s fiery, fatal crash on I-10 in Baldwin County that stemmed from a police chase, authorities said Tuesday.

Joseph L. Andrews, 81, of St. Simons Island, Georgia, was driving his 2018 Ford Escape with his son, Kevin J. Andrews, 54, of Miami Florida, as a passenger when the car was hit by a 2019 Chevrolet Malibu driving the wrong way on I-10 westbound near the Baldwin Beach Express exit in Baldwin County, authorities said.

Joseph Andrews was airlifted to University Hospital in Mobile with severe injuries while Kevin Andrews died at the scene of the crash. The father, who was the lone survivor of the incident, and his son were wearing seat belts.

The crash stemmed from a police chase of a 2019 Chevrolet Malibu that refused to yield during a traffic stop by a Baldwin County sheriff’s deputy on I-10 eastbound near Loxley. The Malibu made a U-torn and drove the wrong way on I-10 westbound when it collided with the Escape.

All of the occupants of the Malibu -- a driver and two passengers -- died. Their names were not released late Tuesday afternoon pending positive identification.
