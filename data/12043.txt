A suspect who shot at San Francisco police during a pursuit before killing himself during a standoff on Treasure Island early Tuesday morning has been identified by the medical examiner's office as 29-year-old Duncan Phillips.



Phillips was wanted by Benicia police for allegedly stealing his ex-girlfriend's car at gunpoint and robbing and pistol-whipping another woman last Thursday.

Monday afternoon, November 26, a Solano county judge signed an arrest warrant for Philips alleging robbery, burglary, assault with a deadly weapon, car jacking and attempted robbery. Bail had been set at $230,000.



Phillips was spotted in a stolen car by San Francisco police at about 11 p.m. Monday at Mason and Bush streets after his father had called 911 following some sort of dispute between the pair, police spokesman Officer Carlos Manfredi said.



Officers tried to stop the vehicle but it did not pull over, instead running through multiple red lights, police said.



A pursuit ensued, during which at least one shot was fired from the vehicle toward officers, who were not hit by the gunfire.



The pursuit continued onto the Bay Bridge and ended on Treasure Island, where Phillips got out of the car and ran to the shoreline and threatened to kill himself.



After an hours-long standoff, police heard a single gunshot and then moved in to find Phillips suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.



He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.



Traffic was blocked going in to and off of Treasure Island during the standoff and residents were asked to stay inside their homes. Traffic was reopened by shortly after 6 a.m., according to the California Highway Patrol.



The American Red Cross responded to the Transbay Terminal in San Francisco to assist Treasure Island residents who were not able to get to their homes.
