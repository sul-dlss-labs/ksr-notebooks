A Collier County Sheriff’s Office deputy responding to an unverified 911 call in Immokalee shortly after 9:30 p.m. Sunday found two people fighting in a parking lot at the intersection of North Third and Main Streets.

Juan A. Ruiz was armed with a knife. When the deputy ordered Ruiz to put down the knife, he refused and came toward the deputy.

"The deputy shot the armed subject in order to stop the threat," the agency said in a news release.

Ruiz had his 46th birthday the day before.

The man who was stabbed, Mario Umanzor, 55, was treated for his injuries at Lee Memorial Hospital. Ruiz was also taken to the hospital, where he was declared dead.

The unidentified deputy was not injured.

In accordance with CCSO policy, the deputy who fired the weapon will be placed on administrative leave. A criminal investigation will be conducted into the altercation between the two subjects, and a Professional Responsibility Bureau investigation will be conducted to ensure that the firing of the weapon was within the agency’s policies and procedures.
