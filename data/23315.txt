An Edwards Police Department officer shot and killed the suspect in an alleged crime spree Friday afternoon that began in Hinds County continued into Madison County and ended back in Hinds.

The shooting occurred in a yard near the intersection of Tucker Lane and Mississippi 22 in west Hinds County, about 10 miles north of the rural town of Bolton.

Hinds County Coroner Sharon Grisham Stewart is treating the man as a "John Doe" until her office can make a positive ID.

She said her initial examination revealed the man was shot once in the head.

The Edwards officer, who's identity has not been released, told deputies he shot the the man as the suspect charged at him in a truck. The vehicle was later determined to have been reported stolen to the Jackson Police Department, according to the Sheriff's Department.

Authorities believe the same man assaulted a 50-year-old Hinds County woman Friday morning who was out for a jog on Pine Grove Road near U.S. 49.

A neighbor reported a description of the suspect's vehicle to deputies, who then learned the vehicle matched the description of a vehicle Madison County authorities say was involved in a hit and run, involving a pedestrian.

The sheriff's office dispatched a helicopter and located the vehicle on Farr Road in Hinds County. Deputies attempted to stop the truck, but they said the suspect refused to stop and attempted to ram their vehicles.

The driver turned into a driveway and continued through a yard, before being fatally shot by the officer, the department said.

The officer received injuries to his leg and was taken by ambulance to a local hospital.

Stewart estimated the age of the deceased black male to be in his late 20s to early 30s. The coroner said her office would attempt to make an identification from the man's fingerprints.

The condition of the woman assaulted in Hinds County and the pedestrian struck in Madison County was not available.
