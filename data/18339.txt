A man is dead in Metcalfe County after an officer-involved shooting happened just before one Sunday morning.

Kentucky State Police say Metcalfe County dispatch received a call from a woman who said she and her boyfriend, 38-year-old Kenny Tomblin, had been in a physical fight, and that he was outside shooting a gun into the air as she called police from a neighborâ€™s home.

After the dispatcher heard shots in the background, a Metcalfe County deputy was dispatched to Junior Caffee Road, four miles east of Edmonton, and backup was requested from KSP Post 15.

When police arrived on scene, Tomblin had a verbal exchange with the deputy before going into his home, and coming back outside with a rifle.

Tomblin began approaching Troopers, refusing to following commands to put down his firearm, and fired the weapon.

Troopers returned fire, fatally shooting Tomblin.

No one else was injured during the incident.

The investigation is on-going.
