Two RTD security guards fired their weapons Wednesday night in the shooting death of a 43-year-old man outside the light rail station on Sheridan Boulevard.

The deceased was identified as Armando Vigil, who died from multiple gunshot wounds, the Denver Medical Examinerâ€™s Office announced Thursday.

The two guards were patrolling the light rail station and parking garage on bicycles when they saw a man lying in the grass near the parking garage, said Denver police Cmdr. Barb Archer. The guards could not tell if the man was asleep or passed out so they approached to check on his well-being.

The man raised up and pointed a gun at the security guards, Archer said during a Thursday afternoon press conference that was shown via Periscope, a live video streaming app.

The security guards ordered Vigil to drop his weapon as they began backing up. A female security guard fell as she backed away, and her partner, a male security guard, fired his weapon, Archer said.

Vigil rolled over and then raised his gun a second time, Archer said. Both RTD officers then fired their guns at him, she said.

The security guards called for medical assistance. The suspect later died from the gunshot wounds at Denver Health Medical Center, Archer said. The female security guard was treated at a hospital for injuries she sustained when she fell although Archer did not provide details on the severity of those injuries.

Archer said she did not know whether Vigil fired his weapon, and she declined to discuss how many shots were fired at the scene.

The security guards are employees of Allied Universal Security, the firm hired by RTD to patrol its buses and light rail lines. They are not sworn police officers but are certified to carry weapons and licensed by the city, Archer said.

The investigation is ongoing, Archer said.
