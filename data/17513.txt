A knife-wielding man possibly suffering from mental illness who was fatally shot by Los Angeles police during a standoff in Sylmar was identified Friday morning.

The man was identified as 20-year-old Cesar Frias, of Sylmar, according to the Los Angeles County coroner.

Frias was pronounced dead at a local hospital several hours after being shot, police said.

The incident began around 7 p.m. Tuesday in the 14700 block of Lakeside Street, where officers ran into a man armed with a kitchen knife.

Officers attempted to subdue the man using a Taser and bean bag gun, but neither of the weapons had an effect, Det. Meghan Aguilar of the Los Angeles Police Department told the Los Angeles Times.

Instead, the man went inside a ranch-style home, triggering a standoff with police. Officers at the scene called in SWAT officers and a psychologist. A crisis negotiator team also made repeated attempts to contact the man, who was alone in the house, police said.

Sometime after midnight Wednesday, SWAT officers fired gas into the house, Aguilar said. At about 1:30 a.m., the man walked out of the home without warning and SWAT officers again fired Taser darts and bean bag rounds at him, police said.

The man then ran to the side of the house into the backyard, where SWAT officers attempted to apprehend him. During the struggle, Aguilar said, the man cut one of the officers in the arm.

“The partner officer then fired his weapon,” she said.

The officer-involved shooting remains under investigation. The names of the officers involved have not been released.
