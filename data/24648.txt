The city of South Bend is being sued along with police officer Justin Gorny for the wrongful death of Erica Flores, who was

.

According to the lawsuit against Gorny and the city, on July 20, an officer in an undercover car was following a speeder. They asked for some help from other officers in the area with a traffic stop. Multiple officers responded to the call and went to help out.

A couple miles away, Justin Gorny wasn't assigned to help out with the traffic stops in that area, knew several other officers were responding and nobody had asked for his help. Despite that, he decided to take it upon himself to help anyway.

In order to get to the stop, he started speeding, going up to 98 mph in a 30 mph zone without using his emergency siren or lights. It was then that he crashed and killed Erica Flores.

Where South Bend comes into play is that the lawsuit alleges the city knew officers working at night consistently travel above 50 mph. It claims South Bend also knew officers responded to incidents without the proper use of lights or sirens frequently at night.

With that information, the lawsuit says South Bend has failed to properly train its officers to drive safely at high speeds, when it's proper to use lights and sirens and how to drive through an intersection.

The lawsuit says officers do get a drivers training course twice a year. It goes for five to 10 minutes with max speeds of 50 mph. The training includes no lessons on when to use lights and sirens. The lawsuit says that's inadequate training that resulted in a horrible loss of life.

Through all of this, Flores's family is hoping for justice, or at least some type of payment, but no amount could ever make up for what has happened.

There isn't a court date set, but the civil case requests a jury trial.
