Several residents in a DeKalb County neighborhood had a long, nervous night after they were forced to evacuate their homes while a SWAT team negotiated with a man barricaded inside a house.

Thursday morning’s ordeal in Stone Mountain lasted more than five hours, finally ending with a woman injured and the man dead.

DeKalb police were called to the 1200 block of Sherrington Drive about 4:15 a.m. after the man shot a female relative while having a mental health crisis, according to spokeswoman Michaela Vincent. Police said other relatives were also in the home at the time.

The SWAT team was activated when the man refused to come out of the home, she said.

The officers were eventually able to remove the injured woman, along with other relatives, from the home and she was taken to a hospital. Her condition was not released.

The SWAT team stood down shortly before 9:30 a.m. after Vincent said the man was discovered dead “from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.”

His name was not released.

Parts of Sherrington Drive were closed for hours during the standoff and investigation. A large police presence remained in the neighborhood, which is located off Redan and South Hairston roads, until the afternoon.
