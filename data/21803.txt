The Burns man fatally shot by a Dickson police officer in Hickman County on Sunday afternoon has been identified as Kyle Andrew Lankford.

Lankford was shot after a pursuit ended with Lankford pulling a knife and the officer shooting him, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

The shots followed a physical altercation that ensued between Lankford and the police officer, according to the TBI.

“Initial reports indicate the incident began in Dickson, when a Dickson police officer responded to a report of a stolen vehicle,” said TBI spokesperson Susan Niland. “The officer pursued the vehicle, and (Lankford) did not stop, leading to a pursuit. At some point, the vehicle was stopped at the intersection of Buckner Ridge Road and Bear Creek Road in Hickman County.”

A second Dickson police officer also arrived at that scene, Niland said.

A passenger in the vehicle fled on foot and was pursued by an officer, however that person escaped.

The investigation is ongoing. The TBI violent crime response team is currently collecting evidence and processing the scene. TBI special agents also continue to interview witnesses.

At the investigation’s conclusion, the case file will be turned over to 21st District Attorney General Kim Helper for review.
