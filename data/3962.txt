A California Highway Patrol officer shot and killed a man Sunday morning after the two allegedly fought and the man displayed a gun, authorities said.

The officer saw the man run a red light at Long Beach Boulevard and Palmer Street about 9:15 a.m., said CHP Officer Armando Clemente. After the officer followed the suspect, the man jumped out of the car and fled on foot. The officer caught up with the man and, when the two struggled, saw a gun, Clemente said. “The officer feared for his life and shot the suspect,” he said.
