Police officers responding to a vehicle theft in Fife Friday morning shot and killed a suspect after a short chase, authorities said.

Sgt. Darren Moss with the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said it happened about 5:49 a.m. Friday at 3500 20th St. E. of a reported stolen motor vehicle.

When Fife Police officers and Washington State Patrol found the reportedly stolen "yard truck" --used to maneuver semi-trailers into warehouses-- they tried to stop the vehicle, prompting a short pursuit. The caller reportedly advised officers the vehicle couldn't exceed 35mph.

Officers were able to stop the vehicle using stop sticks. The truck caused damage to numerous warehouses, businesses, and a Fife Police vehicle.

The vehicle soon approached a warehouse parking lot at 6522 20th E where officers radioed that shots had been fired. Officers attempted life-saving measures on the suspect who was shot, but the person died. No officers were injured.

Authorities have not released any additional information.

This is a developing story.
