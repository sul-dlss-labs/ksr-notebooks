Office of the District Attorney, 18th Judicial District A black semiautomatic handgun police say they recovered from the scene of an officer-involved shooting that left Antonio Sanchez Jr. dead.

Three Aurora Police Department officers have been cleared of criminal wrongdoing in the June shooting death of Antonio Sanchez Jr., a suspect in another shooting.

Officers Darien Hunt and Troy Raines and Sgt. Greg Garcia were legally justified because they reasonably believed Sanchez was going to use imminent physical force against them, according to a letter written by Jacob Edson, chief deputy district attorney for the 18th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

In an interview with investigators, Garcia said he had a perfect view of Sanchez in the driver’s seat of his car and clearly saw him reach down and pull up a pistol.

Sanchez had a “murderous intent, his intent was to shoot a cop,” Garcia is quoted as saying in the letter.

The three officers fired a total 19 rounds at Sanchez after a car chase on June 29. Sanchez, who was a suspect in a shooting the previous day, pointed his gun in the officers’ direction, the letter said. The officers unsuccessfully attempted to save Sanchez’s life after they shot him, the letter said.

The shooting took place in the parking lot of a gas station on East Sixth Avenue.

The officers were wearing body cameras but none of them captured clear views of what happened. Hunt’s camera was on, but because of the commotion, it does not show what happened, the letter said. Raines and Garcia only activated their cameras after shots were fired.

It was the second deadly police shooting that week in Aurora.
