GIRARDVILLE â€” State Police in Frackville say that a man died in custody after being tased by officers.

Police responded to the area of Main and 2nd streets in Girardville, Schuylkill County, where they say Lucas Markus, 33, of Minersville, was allegedly running up and down the street yelling and trying to get into vehicles.

Police made contact with Markus upon their arrival, but Markus allegedly did not respond to verbal commands from arriving officers. Markus was subsequently tasered, but as officers were placing him in handcuffs, he went into cardiac arrest.

Troopers immediately called for an ambulance and began CPR on Markus, who was later air transported to Penn State Health St. Joseph in Reading.

He was later pronounced dead.

An autopsy will be performed at a later date to determine the cause of death. The investigation of the incident is ongoing.
