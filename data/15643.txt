TUNICA, Miss. — A Mississippi Gaming Commission agent was shot and killed Wednesday morning.

Allen Godfrey, the commission’s executive director in Jackson, said Gorman was shot during a training exercise when another agent’s gun discharged accidentally. The agent involved in the shooting has been suspended with pay during the investigation into the shooting. Gorman had been with the MGC for 22 years and had been promoted to Director of Investigations the day before he was killed. Gaming agents monitor casinos to ensure they are following state laws.
