EAST VILLAGE â€” An ex-con running from police was struck and killed by a cab while trying to bolt across the FDR Drive Tuesday night, authorities said.

Makever Brown, 22, who lived in the Jacob Riis Houses, was approached by cops and then took off across the FDR Drive at East Sixth Street, police said.

At some point, the officers lost him, police said. He was found unconscious at 10:48 p.m. after being struck by a livery cab in the northbound lanes of the highway.

Brown, who had prior arrests for robbery and drug possession, was on probation and had a warrant for his arrest, police added.

It's not clear what the warrant was for.

The cab driver stayed at the scene and had not been charged with any crime as of Wednesday, police said.
