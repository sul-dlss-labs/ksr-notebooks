Ramseyer continued advancing toward the UHP car and trooper, so the trooper shot him with a Taser. The blast knocked him to the ground, but as police approached him he "immediately sprang to his feet and charged full speed" at an officer. A footnote in the documents mentions that all of the officers were surprised by the way he jumped up, describing it as being "like spring steel," "an ejector booster," and "an NFL linebacker going for a quarterback."
