ATLANTIC COUNTY -- The Atlantic City police officer who shot and killed a man moments after the suspect stabbed to death a store clerk has been cleared in the death.

An grand jury on Thursday declined to indict any of the five officers who converged on the Cedar Market on July 8, according to a release from the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office.

The unnamed cop fired eight shots at the suspect after he stepped out of the store and refused orders to drop the knife he was carrying, authorities said.

There was neither a verbal nor a physical confrontation between the employee, Peter Fareg, 29, and his killer, identified by PressofAtlanticCity.com as city resident Tremaine Dantzler.

Dantlzer, who was struck by gunfire five times, was moving toward the officer outside the store when the first shot was fired, according to witnesses. He was a known drug addict recently released from jail and hand't been taking his medication, according to WPVI-6.

Fareg was in his second day as a cashier at the business on the intersection of Adriatic and Pennsylvania avenues. He arrived from Egypt less than a week before being killed.
