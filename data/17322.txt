‘In January we received a report in reference to an underage female who wasn’t an ex-student at Putnam City North but then transferred to a program at Francis Tuttle.

‘This individual who is our victim in the case gave us information that she had had a consensual sexual relationship with Mr Mackie that had gone through a period of about four months.

‘We did have enough information for an arrest warrant and we also applied for a search warrant so our tactical unit could go inside the house.

‘Yesterday evening at about 6.25pm is when the actual search warrant and arrest warrant were obtained. Tactical unit members made entry into the house using the tactical robot and the camera system.

‘We found Mr Mackie deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. It was over just before 8pm last night.’

Counselors were at the school on Wednesday to help students cope on what a spokesman for the school district called ‘a somber day’.

Mackie’s Facebook page says he has been married since 1999 and his LinkedIn account says he has three children – a 21-year-old daughter and two sons, aged 15 and 12.

He had been teaching at Putnam City North High School for 10 months and previously worked for United Airlines.
