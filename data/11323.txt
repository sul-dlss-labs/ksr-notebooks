Suspect shot, killed in confrontation with officer Published 1:47 am Friday, May 11, 2012

The details surrounding an encounter between an officer with the Selma Police Department and a suspect remain under investigation. And, after reports of the encounter — which led to the officer shooting the suspect, killing him — the investigation is now in the hands of the Alabama Bureau of Investigation.

Shortly after 6:30 p.m. Thursday, dispatchers received a call for a reported man with a gun in the 300 block of Tenth Avenue.

It was there the unidentified officer and the suspect met.

“At this point, there is not very much we can say since the investigation is being led by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation,” Lt. David Evans with the Selma Police Department said. “We can report the suspect was declared dead at the hospital.”

The suspect, who was transported to Vaughan Regional Medical Center, was pronounced dead at the hospital shortly after his arrival.

The suspect, who was not identified as authorities worked to notify the family, was reportedly in his mid-20s.

Selma Police officials declined comment on any further details of the incident, including whether the suspect had a gun in his possession at the time of the shooting.

Calls left for Selma Chief of Police William T. Riley were unreturned Thursday evening.

According to Evans, anytime there is an officer-related shooting, it is department policy that the Alabama Bureau of Investigation is called in and asked to lead the investigation.
