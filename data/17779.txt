GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- A robbery suspect shot and killed by a Kentwood police officer after a credit union hold-up has been identified as 38-year-old Frank Anthony Kelley.

Grand Rapids police identified Kelley on Tuesday, June 14.

Kelley was a probation absconder and had a previous armed robbery conviction, according to Michigan Department of Corrections records.

He was sentenced April 18 on a breaking and entering charge and placed on probation, with an order to report to the Kent County Jail on May 9 to serve a year in jail. Court records show he violated that probation on May 5 and was nowhere to be found.

Kelley's criminal record includes 1994 convictions for armed robbery and accessory after the fact to a felony, and possession of a firearm by a felon in 1999.

A Kentwood police officer shot and killed Kelley following a foot chase at Oxford Place Apartments, 2143 43rd St. SE.

Police say he pointed a handgun at the officer before the shooting.

His death came after the ATL Federal Credit Union on 36th Street was robbed just before 10 a.m. Monday.

Police pursued the suspect's vehicle along 36th Street and later onto 44th Street before the vehicle pursuit ended at the apartment complex.

Court records show that Thomas S. Fox Jewelers was the victim of the recent breaking and entering charge.

As part of the April 18 sentencing, Kelley was ordered to pay almost $62,000 in restitution.
