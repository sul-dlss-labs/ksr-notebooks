Oswego police acted properly and were justified in using force in the fatal shooting of a man who threatened officers with knives outside a motel in unincorporated Kendall County, said State's Atty. Melissa Barnhart.

Barnhart said last week that an investigation was closed and that no charges would be filed against two unidentified Oswego officers in the May 23 shooting death of Henry Rossbach, 45, a former Aurora native who lived at the Council Court Motel on U.S. Highway 30.

"The officers, both of whom have several years of experience, acted properly in protecting themselves from obvious injury," Barnhart said.

An Illinois State Police report cited videotaped evidence and eyewitness accounts that indicated the officers were in imminent danger from Rossbach, who allegedly approached them holding two weapons.

"Mr. Rossbach rushed toward the officers holding a machete and a large knife and then lunged toward an officer when shots were fired," said Barnhart in a statement. "He continued to advance until another shot felled him."

The incident began in an industrial park on U.S. 30 where Rossbach allegedly used a knife to smash the window of a parked Oswego police patrol car.

The officer inside the vehicle called for assistance, and Rossbach crossed U.S. 30 to the motel.

"Law-enforcement officers immediately attempted to de-escalate the situation by calmly talking to the man," said Oswego Police Chief Dwight Baird in a statement. "The officers told the man several times to drop the knives. The armed man refused to comply [and] continued to advance upon them.

"Fearing for their lives and the lives of others, two officers discharged their firearms to stop the threat."

The fatal shooting was reportedly the first involving Oswego police officers in the village's 172-year history.
