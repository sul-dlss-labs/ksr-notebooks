A Delaware state trooper shot and killed a man early Sunday after responding to a burglary alarm in Claymont.

Delaware State Police Sgt. Richard D. Bratz said a 16-year veteran of the police force was dragged by the man's vehicle after arriving at the Rite Aid at Northtowne Plaza in the 600 block of Naamans Road in Claymont just after 130 a.m.

The trooper, who was not named by police, arrived at the store and saw the 35-year-old man's vehicle parked in the back of the building. As the trooper exited his vehicle, he saw the man leaving the Rite Aid and quickly entering his vehicle, Bratz said. The man attempted to drive off with the trooper at his opened driver's side door, dragging the trooper as he reversed the vehicle. His car then struck the trooper's marked Tahoe. Bratz said the man again attempted to drive off, dragging the trooper more. At that point, Bratz said, the trooper fired his work-issued weapon, striking the man in the upper torso.

Bratz said the trooper immediately rendered aid to the man until EMS arrived. He was airlifted to Christiana Hospital, where he was pronounced dead just after 4 a.m. The man has not been identified by police.

The trooper suffered lacerations and contusions and was transported to Wilmington Hospital where he was treated and released, Bratz said.

The trooper, assigned to Troop 1 in Claymont, was placed on administration leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

Detectives from the Delaware State Police Homicide Unit responded to the scene and are conducting the investigation.
