Authorities are investigating after a 50-year-old Victorville man died in sheriff’s custody earlier this week.

Rodney Coleman was pronounced dead at a local hospital Wednesday after the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said he experienced an “unknown medical emergency” while under arrest.

Deputies responded that morning just before 9 a.m. to the intersection of Park Avenue and Palmdale Road for a disturbance.

“It was reported a man was pacing back and forth and harassing a female at the bus stop,” sheriff’s official said.

A deputy handcuffed Coleman “without incident” after arriving at the scene, according to authorities.

“When the deputy attempted to close the car door, Coleman kicked at the deputy and exited the car,” the sheriff’s department said. “The deputy suffered a minor injury.”

Emergency responders came and administered aid to the deputy.

That’s when Coleman reportedly suffered the medical emergency. Medical personnel began treating him and administered CPR but he later died, officials said.

The sheriff’s department made the announcement of Coleman’s death on Friday and said an autopsy would be conducted to determine the cause of death.

The deputy was also taken to the hospital but has since been released and is recovering at home.

Anyone with information or anyone who may have witnessed the incident is asked by the sheriff's department to contact Detective Adrian Bustamante, Specialized Investigations Division at 909-387-3589.
