Two Gadsden police officers will not be charged in the fatal shooting of a murder suspect on Christmas Eve 2016.

Sgt. John Hallman of Gadsden police said an Etowah County grand jury investigating the shooting of Orande Kandie Hayes of Detroit, Mich., found no evidence for charges. This was after an investigation by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.

Hayes was shot to death by officers following the shooting death of Lillian Davison in Jacksonville Court on Christmas Eve morning.

Hallman said officers responded to a call at 12:58 a.m. Dec. 24, 2016, on reports of a shooting. When officers arrived, they found Davison dead from multiple gunshots.

Officers identified Hayes as a suspect and witnesses gave a description of his clothing. Minutes later, Hayes was spotted on Wetter Street.

Hallman said Hayes pulled a handgun and two officers fired, hitting him. He was later pronounced dead at a Gadsden hospital.
