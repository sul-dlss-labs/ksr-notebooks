NEW BRUNSWICK

— City police officers today spoke out for the first time on the fatal shooting of a city man by an officer, calling for city residents to hold their judgment of the officers involved.

"We request that the residents of New Brunswick wait for the results of the prosecutor’s investigation before passing judgment on the men and women sworn to protect them," New Brunswick police union president Mark Sutton said in a statement.

He said officers "do not work their shifts with the intent or desire to use deadly force."



"In certain instances, however, the use of such force becomes necessary for police officers entrusted with protecting the lives and safety of the public. The PBA and the Superior Officers Association (locals) reaffirm their support of these officers," Sutton said.

Barry Deloatch, 47, was fatal shot about 12:10 a.m. Sept. 22. Deloatch ran down an alley behind 105 Throop Ave., and two officers followed him. On police dispatch tapes from that night, a man is heard saying officers were caught under a fence and a man was trying to hit officers with a stick, and that a shot was fired.

The Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office is investigating the shooting, which has sparked a string of protests.

Salaam Ismial, a community activist based in Elizabeth, has led several protests. He said a forum on police-community relations is set for Nov. 17, at the Sharon Baptist Church in New Brunswick, and the Rev. Al Sharpton will be among the speakers.

Ismial said a representative from the U.S. Attorney's Office will also attend the meeting. Ismial said he met with Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan on Wednesday.

Union president Sutton, in his statement today, noted that "individuals outside our community" along with a small group within protest demonstrators have "attempted to create division between the community and its police force."

"This group seeks to advance its own personal and political agenda, which is harmful to the interests of our community," Sutton said.

Mayor James Cahill has held a public forum on police-community relations, and appointed a local attorney to act as a liaison with residents about issues with the police department.
