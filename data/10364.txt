The incident began with police responding to a "shots fired" call in the 9400 block of South Justine Street, police said in a formal statement.

Officers arriving on the scene received a detailed description of four men who fled on foot, according to Patrick Camden, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police.

A short time later, another squad car spotted four men matching the description walking east near 95th and Wood streets, according to both police and Camden.

When the officers approached the men for questioning, they ran down an alley. The officers saw one of the men running with a gun in his hand.

The officers drew their weapons and ordered the man to drop his, according to Camden. When the man, 22, turned, the weapon still in hand, one of the officers opened fire, striking the man, Camden said.

He was identified this morning by the Cook County medical examiner's office as Robert Bassie, 23, of the 9700 block of South Charles Avenue.

The other three men got away.

In their statement, police said Bassie pointed the weapon at officers as he turned toward them. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead at 11:48 p.m..

Police said they recovered a gun at the scene but didn't confirm Camden's statement that it was a TEC-9 pistol.

A representative with the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates police-involved shootings, confirmed the incident, but didn't have any additional details.
