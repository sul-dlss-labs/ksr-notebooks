In a statement issued Thursday night, State Police said Fowlkes was driving a Civic LX owned by a Stamford woman. He was attempting to elude a Norwalk police officer who was trying to make a traffic stop when the pursuit and crash occurred in the residential neighborhood just north of St. John's Cemetery, police said.

The Civic was westbound on Geneva Road just after 11 a.m. when it failed to make a right curve in the roadway near Candlewood Lane, police said. The vehicle spun clockwise and slammed into rocks at 27 Geneva Road, then continued spinning and slammed into a tree at 31 Geneva Road, police said. The car made impact on its left side and came to a final rest in a stream on the property, police said.
