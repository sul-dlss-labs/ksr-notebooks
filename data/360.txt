A federal jury has found that a San Diego police officer did not use excessive force on a 33-year-old man who died during a July 2000 arrest.

The family of Clifford Poe sued Officer Elias Rodriguez and the city of San Diego, alleging negligence.

Rodriguez had spotted Poe in the North Park neighborhood near the site of a vandalism complaint. Police said that during the arrest, Poe tried to swallow a bag of drugs.
