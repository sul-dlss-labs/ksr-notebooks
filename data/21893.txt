CAMDEN, N.J. -- A city man was shot and killed by a police officer after the officer was fired upon, Acting Camden County Prosecutor Joshua M. Ottenberg said Monday.

The deceased, Braxton Lane, 28, of Kenwood Avenue, was shot several times in the 1100 block of Kenwood about 3:15 a.m. The incident, authorities said, began on Wildwood Avenue when the 33-year-old officer on patrol noticed a 1996 Ford Taurus that matched the description of a vehicle sought in an unrelated investigation.The officer ran the vehicle's plates through police databases and found the vehicle's registration was suspended. Before the officer turned on his lights to pull the vehicle over, a passenger, Lane, jumped out and ran down an alley between Haddon and Princess avenues.

The officer drove his cruiser down the alley and Lane fired at least three shots. Lane turned right and ran down another alley parallel to Wildwood Avenue. Another police cruiser joined the pursuit. The officers pursued the suspect on foot into the 1100 block of Kenwood. Lane turned to fire again and the officer who began the pursuit fired, striking him several times. The

entire chase took about four minutes.

Police recovered from the deceased a semi-automatic 9 mm handgun. Investigators found the Ford Taurus that began the chase at Pershing and Morton streets. The driver was also located and interviewed. No charges are expected to be brought against him in this matter.

Lane was released Nov. 21 from the New Jersey State Prison after serving more than four years for assault, causing serious bodily injury, resisting arrest by eluding a police officer and weapons charges. He was sentenced July 3, 2003.



The officer involved in the shooting, who began working at the Camden Police Department in January 2002, will be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of a Camden County Prosecutor's Office investigation. The officer's identity is being withheld because of the ongoing investigation.
