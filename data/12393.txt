A police officer shot and killed a 21-year-old man early Wednesday after he robbed a drugstore, fled the scene and pointed an assault rifle at two officers on the city’s near-northeast side, police said.

The Allen County Coroner’s Office identified the man as Stephen O’Neal Wattley II of Fort Wayne. The names of the two officers involved in the shooting were not released. Both officers were placed on a five-day paid administrative leave as part of standard procedure.

At 2:27 a.m. Wednesday, officers were called to an armed robbery at CVS Pharmacy, 2802 E. State Blvd., at Beacon Street.

Officers chased Wattley toward Baldwin Creek Apartments in the 1900 block of Hobson Road. As two officers approached Building F, they found Wattley standing in the stairwell area on the second floor, York said.

Wattley seemed unfamiliar with the apartment complex, York said, and didn’t realize that the top of the stairway was blocked, trapping him at the top of the stairs.

“He ran up the stairway and discovered it was boarded off,” York said. “The officers were at the bottom of the stairs… then Wattley turned around and pointed the weapon at the officers.”

One of the two officers fired his weapon at Wattley, striking him multiple times, York said.
