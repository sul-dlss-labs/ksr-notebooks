A source told WISN 12 News that Leon Davis killed his wife, Sherida Davis, before turning the gun on himself inside the couple's home near North 97th Street and Goodrich Avenue on Milwaukee's north side. Officials said Leon Davis was pronounced dead inside the home. Sherida Davis died after being taken to a nearby hospital.
