HOLLIDAYSBURG â€” A 16-year-old girl was killed and three people were injured after a police chase ended in a violent crash, authorities said.



Kelsey Miller of Nanty Glo, died in the crash and was pronounced dead at Altoona Regional Trauma Center, the Altoona Mirror reported.



The 17-year-old male driver from Vintondale; a 14-year-old Nanty Glo girl and Patrick Fyock Jr., 21, of Vintondale, were taken to the trauma center, the Mirror reported. Fyock was listed in critical condition, a nursing supervisor said.



Charges are pending against the driver, who was not identified because of his age, police said.
