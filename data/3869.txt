Out of the 31 rds, how many hit?



+1



trigger happy guys need to go to the range morehr



Only one?? Wow, I'll defend myself from now on! (Oh wait, thats why I bought a .45

On another note, I agree, shoot at cops, get shot, but seriously. I could probably drop a guy in far fewer shots than 31, even if there were two of me and I was firing an 9mm....... Get to the Range people! Don't get me wrong, I would probably empty my mag after being hit in the face, but after hitting the guy once or twice, you could probably see him slump over and die. Those fatal shots should have come way before round #31, stressful situation or not. Training can only make you better. I'm not saying I am a marksman or anything, I just think our LEO's should be given the tools of the trade and the know how to use them so that it does not take 31 rounds from two different people to hit one target a couple of times. Seems a little off to me. Kinda scary that the people we pay to protect us have that kind of hit ratio. Only one?? Wow, I'll defend myself from now on!
