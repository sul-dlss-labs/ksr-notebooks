The Oklahoma Highway Patrol says two law officers and a suspect died during a pursuit in western Oklahoma.

Lt. Brian Orr said Thursday he had no details about the deaths other than that they occurred near Dill City in Washita County -- about 110 miles west of Oklahoma City. Orr declined to reveal the law enforcement agency or agencies the deceased officers worked for. Dill City is located about 15 miles south of Interstate 40 near Foss.

The chase started when the Washita County Undersheriff tried to serve the suspect with a felony warrant and the suspect took off.

Photos taken from the scene show the two police cars that collided during the chase. The Washita Deputy and Burns Flat Officer were killed in that crash.

They were chasing 27-year-old Quentin Lee Johnson of Sentinel, Okla. We know Johnson lost control during the pursuit, crashing his car. He also died.

Court records show Johnson was facing charges of possession of meth, knowingly concealing stolen property, possession of firearm after former felony conviction and unlawful possession of drug paraphernalia.

"The undersheriff was driving an SUV that was beat up very badly in the front and the burns flat officer was driving, I believe, a dodge charger and that also was hit very badly from the front. I want to say it also had a lot of damage from the left side," said Shawn Brubaker with the Cordell Beacon.

A spokesman with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol did not release the names of the officers involved. Departments from across Oklahoma have taken to social media to offer their support and prayers for the families of the deputy and officer.
