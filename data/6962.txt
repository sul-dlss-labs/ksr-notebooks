Lawrence Smith, 24, a black man, was fatally shot in an officer-involved shooting at 5160 Vineland Ave. in North Hollywood about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday, March 4.

According to police, the shooting occurred when an off-duty U.S. deputy marshal saw two men attempting to rob the store he was in. Police said the marshal confronted the robbers and fired several shots.

Smith was hit in the head and taken to a hospital, where he died at 6:22 p.m.

The name of the marshal was not released, pending an investigation of the shooting. The second black man fled on foot and is still at large. The incident may be linked to a series of robberies in the area by the Skeleton Bandits, police said.
