The man who died Monday in a stolen truck after it was struck by a Klamath County sheriff's deputy pursuing him has been identified as Matthew Stephen Colligan.

At about 12:30 a.m., Klamath County sheriff's deputies were in pursuit of 28-year-old Colligan who was driving a stolen pickup truck. During the pursuit, deputies lost sight of the vehicle but found it again in the 1200 block of Lakeshore Drive in Klamath Falls.

That's when a deputy's Ford F350 crashed into the driver's side of the truck, said Klamath County District Attorney Rob Patridge, who is acting as a spokesperson for this ongoing investigation.

The crash was not an intentional or "tactical move to stop the car," Patridge said.

Colligan died at the scene.

According to court records, Colligan has been convicted of eluding police officers in the past. In May 2015, he was sentenced to at least 10 days in jail followed by 18 months of probation for attempting to elude a police officer, recklessly endangering another person and criminal mischief in the second degree. In October, a warrant was issued for his arrest after he violated his probation.
