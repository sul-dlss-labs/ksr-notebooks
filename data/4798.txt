Police on Tuesday identified a man who apparently killed himself after exchanging gunfire with officers on New Year’s Eve as Michael Richter, 27.

Police said Richter died at a hospital early Monday. Officers found him unconscious in the street with a gunshot wound to the head shortly after Saturday’s shootout in the 300 block of North Occidental Boulevard.

Richter allegedly fired at officers who responded to a report that he had threatened his wife with a gun. He fled when the officers fired back, then shot himself as they searched for him, authorities said.
