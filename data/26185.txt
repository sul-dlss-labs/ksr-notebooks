The man who died in a gun battle with law enforcement near Lake Mathews on June 11 has been identified as Thomas Ray Berry, 52.

The Riverside County Coroner’s Office said Berry died at 8:26 p.m. in the 17000 block of Cedarwood Drive in the Lake Mathews area south of Riverside. Berry does not have a documented criminal record in Riverside County.

The shooting occurred after deputies responded at 7:11 p.m. to a report of a domestic disturbance. They arrived at 7:23 p.m. and set up a perimeter as a precaution in case the suspect fled, a sheriff’s spokesman said. A woman stepped out of the home to talk with deputies, and the man came out soon after.

A deputy and a Cal Fire law enforcement officer fired on Berry. The shooting took place at 8:13 p.m., the coroner said. A deputy was shot during the gun battle. He was released from Riverside Community Hospital the next day.
