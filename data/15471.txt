Sheriff’s officials have identified a man fatally shot by officers in Wildomar last month.

Thomas Edward Brazeail, 38, of Menifee, was shot after leading officers on a chase from Lake Elsinore on Dec. 10, Riverside County sheriff’s officials said. He died at the scene.

The pursuit began around 5:15 p.m. after deputies spotted a car that had been reported stolen in the area of Lakeshore and Riverside drives, sheriff’s officials said in a news release. The deputies tried to stop the car, but the driver did not pull over.

Deputies chased the car onto Interstate 15, continuing south to Baxter Road in Wildomar, where the vehicle exited the freeway, sheriff’s officials said. The chase ended on nearby Killarney Lane, a rutted, dead-end dirt road. Sheriff’s official said the car crashed into a garage then accelerated toward officers, who opened fire.

No officers were injured.
