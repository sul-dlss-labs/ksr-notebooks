A man killed at a Canada-U.S. border crossing in B.C. earlier this week was wanted in connection to the murder of an 18-year-old in Calgary, police said Sunday.

Jamisonâ€‹ Childress, 20, was fatally shot by a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent on Thursday, after spraying another agent with an unidentified chemical.

He was wanted by police for first-degree murder in relation to the killing of Brando Walker, 18, in Calgary. Walker's partially burned body was found earlier this month by fishermen on the Tsuu T'ina First Nation.

Walker was killed in a home in the northeast Calgary community of Saddleridge but police have not said how his body ended up on the reserve.

Three other people are in custody in connection with Walker's death, police said.

RCMP won't comment on motive but say it was not a random attack.

"Brando Walker was known to these individuals," said Cst. Jason Curtis. "They were associates, all we know is that this was not a random act, they were known to each other."

The three remaining suspects are young men between 15 and 21 years of age.

They will appear in Calgary court next week to face various charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter, and accessory to murder.

RCMP have interviewed about 100 people as part of what they've described as a complex investigation.
