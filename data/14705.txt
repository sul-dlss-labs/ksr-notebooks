Samuel Johnson, a 45-year-old black man, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police officers Wednesday, June 25, near Stocker Street and Santa Rosalia Drive on the border of Baldwin Hills/Crenshaw and View Park-Windsor Hills, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 7:10 p.m., a security guard at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza confronted Johnson, accusing him of shoplifting inside the mall, said LAPD Officer Chris No.

The security guard began talking to Johnson, who then pulled out a handgun and fired at the guard, No said.

The guard was not injured. Johnson fled the mall and Los Angeles police moved into the area and searched the neighborhoods.

Johnson was eventually found in the 3700 block of Santa Rosalia Drive, but he ran and hid inside a home.

Police said Johnson was shot as officers attempted to take him into custody about 8:45 p.m. Johnson was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

The officers involved have been identified as Cliff Chu, Linda Travis and Jason Schwab.
