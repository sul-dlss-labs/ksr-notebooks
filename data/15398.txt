CRITTENDEN, Ky. -- A woman from Louisiana died last month after Kentucky State Police used a Taser to subdue her during an arrest, the Grant County Sheriff's Office confirmed Monday.

At about 11 p.m. on Nov. 22, state troopers responded to a disorderly conduct call at a Marathon gas station east of I-75 at Violet Road in Crittenden. The officers found Jennifer Bond of Port Allen, Louisiana in the station's parking, according to KSP's Lt. Rick Saint-Blancard.

What Saint-Blancard would neither confirm or deny was the use of a Taser by those troopers after Bond resisted arrest.

On Monday, Grant County Sheriff Chuck Dills confirmed the device that stuns its victim with a jolt of electricity was used when asked by WCPO reporter Tom McKee.

After being subdued, Bond was placed in the back of a KSP cruiser, where she then tried to kick out windows.

A few minutes later Bond experienced a medical emergency, Saint-Blancard said.

The troopers on scene performed CPR on Bond until an ambulance arrived and took her Saint Elizabeth Medical Center in Florence. She died there several hours later.

Saint-Blancard said an autopsy was performed on Bond as part of an ongoing investigation into the incident.

He said KSP would not release details of the coroner's report or investigation until a toxicology report was complete.

A timeframe for that report was not given.
