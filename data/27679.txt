Authorities Tuesday identified an alleged knife-wielding woman shot and killed by Torrance police over the weekend as 29-year-old Desiree Nicole Garza of Torrance.

Garza died at a hospital shortly after arrival Sunday, March 8, Torrance Sgt. Alexander Martinez said that day.

Officers were called to the 18200 block of Yukon Avenue shortly before 10:45 a.m. Multiple callers told police Garza was out of control, breaking items inside the home and holding a knife, Martinez said.

Shortly after arrival, officers encountered Garza and an officer-involved shooting occurred. Officers performed life-saving measures before she was taken to the hospital, Martinez said.
