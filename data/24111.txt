DENVER — Authorities say a man wanted for multiple bank robberies was shot and killed by Denver police Wednesday afternoon.

It happened around 4:30 p.m. at the intersection of East Colfax Avenue and Quebec Street.

According to Denver police spokesperson Doug Schepman, officers pulled up behind the suspect’s vehicle stopped at the intersection and attempted to pull him over.

When the suspect noticed the officers, he tried to get away by pulling forward and ramming his vehicle between two cars stopped in front of him at the light, Schepman said.

At that point, Schepman said officers opened fire, killing the unnamed suspect. Police say the man had brandished a handgun before three Denver officers shot the suspect.

A weapon was found in his vehicle, according to police.

A female passenger inside the suspect’s vehicle was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Schepman said it’s unclear if her injuries are related to gunfire.

Authorities are not calling her a suspect at this time.

One Denver officer suffered minor injuries during the incident. However, Schepman said the officer was not struck by bullets.

The suspect’s identity has yet to be released. Schepman said he was a suspect in several bank robberies in multiple states, including Colorado, but he could not say precisely where or when those robberies occurred.

Police have closed both lanes of East Colfax in the area while an investigation continues.
