On Wednesday morning, St. Albans police said two officers stopped by a home on Diamond Street to check on a woman who had been in the hospital nine times in the last two days for hallucinations.When they arrived, Vermont State Police said a gun shot was fired from inside the home. The bullet broke through a frosted glass pane door, missing the head of one of the officers by inches, investigators said.Police said Sargent Frank McCarthy, Sergeant Joe Thomas and Josh Cate, an embedded crisis service specialist assigned to the St. Albans Police Department, were all nearly struck by the bullet.Vermont State Police said all three left, and ran to the home across the street to take cover and try to make contact with those still in the home. No response was allegedly made.A short time later, police used a ladder to get the woman, later identified as Katherine Cristie, 31, out of the home from a second story window. They also discovered a man, later identified as Bruce Hill, 41, inside who died from what was believed to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.Vermont State Police said in all two shots where fired.St. Albans police said Hill was just recently arrested for allegedly selling the drug responsible for causing these abnormal hallucinations. They also said the drug is being sold as “molly” but their reaction to the substance is very abnormal. Northwestern Medical Center said it has seen two patients needing treatment for their reaction to the drug. “They have been telling us these individuals randomly presenting and hallucinating after they have taken some substance that’s available on the street. Although they don’t know for sure what it is. So, we have been aggressively trying to find and identify what that source might be,” Chief Gary Taylor said.One officer suffered minor injures from the glass door.
