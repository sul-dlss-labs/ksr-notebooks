BEACHWOOD — Authorities say a police officer shot and killed an armed man outside an Ocean County bar.

The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office says Beachwood Police Sgt. Bruce Harris was on patrol when he spotted a man making a disturbance in the High Velocity Sports Bar parking lot late Thursday.

The prosecutor's office says the officer saw that 52-year-old Mark Tanouye was armed with a small-caliber handgun.

Authorities say Harris fired once, killing the Beachwood resident after Tanouye ignored repeated commands to drop the weapon.

Harris has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation, which is routine after a police shooting.
