A man shot by Oakland police Saturday afternoon after a reported carjacking and chase through the city’s Rockridge neighborhood has died, according to authorities.

The man, who has not yet been identified, was shot after police say he rammed a stolen vehicle into patrol cars, according to an Oakland Police Department press release.

The shooting happened around 3 p.m. Saturday when police responded to a carjacking in the 2600 block of Fisher Avenue. They later located the carjacking suspect at 49th Street and Clark Street, and police say he fired several shots at officers and fled in the vehicle that he stole.

Officers chased the suspect in squad cars and a police helicopter followed the vehicle overhead until they arrived at the 5900 block of Ocean View Drive and the suspect allegedly attempted to ram the stolen vehicle into police patrol vehicles and officers, police said.

At that point, officers fired shots and struck the suspect. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.
