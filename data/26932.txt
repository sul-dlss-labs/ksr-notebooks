Twenty-five-year-old Gary Alexander Eubanks, Jr., wanted for what Milwaukee police called “heinous crimes” in Alabama, killed himself Wednesday after a standoff inside a west side home.

Milwaukee police learned that the Alabama man was inside a home in the 1200 block of North 46th Street and called a tactical team to the scene, Assistant Chief Michael Brunson said.

Police were in contact with the suspect and knew he had a weapon, Brunson said. After four hours of negotiations and numerous requests to leave the house, police heard a single gunshot and entered the home to find the suspect had died from what they have called a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

He was the only person in the house, Brunson said.

Brunson said the man was involved in “very serious” crimes in both Alabama and Ohio.

According to the Daphne Police Department of Alabama, Eubanks was wanted in connection with a robbery that took place Oct. 21 at the Microtel Inn and Suites.

Baylee Elizabeth Wall, an 18-year-old also wanted in connection with that robbery, was found dead in Ohio on the property of Woodward High School Oct. 23.

The Hamilton County Coroner of Ohio has said her death appears to be a homicide.

In Milwaukee, police remained on the scene for several hours Wednesday night and asked residents to avoid the area of North 46th and West Vliet streets.

The investigation is ongoing.
