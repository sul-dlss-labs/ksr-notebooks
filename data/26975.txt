A Baton Rouge police officer is receiving no citations or criminal charges, not even a speeding ticket, after investigators found he was driving 94 mph on Airline Highway — almost twice the speed limit — when he caused a 2017 wreck that killed an infant and severely injured several other people.

Christopher Manuel was arrested on negligent homicide after the crash, which occurred while he was off-duty and driving his personal vehicle — an orange Corvette. The child's mother was also arrested on the same charge because detectives determined the baby likely wouldn't have died if her car seat had been properly strapped in.

Prosecutors spent months mulling charges against both parties but recently decided to take no action at all.

The case garnered national attention and prompted public outcry almost two years ago as advocates jumped to defend the mother, Brittany Stephens. Criminal justice experts also condemned the decision to arrest her under such circumstances and questioned law enforcement's motives.
