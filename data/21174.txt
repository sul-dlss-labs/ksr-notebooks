APPLETON, Wis. - A man who killed his girlfriend and himself during a standoff with police in western Upper Michigan had pending charges in Outagamie County Circuit Court involving his attack on a Menasha alderman just over a year ago.

Ladd Honkala, 34, of Bessemer, Mich., appeared in the Wisconsin court as recently as Nov. 8. He was scheduled for trial Jan. 14 on charges of substantial battery and disorderly conduct, according to computerized state court records.

A 6-year-old boy was wounded during the standoff in Bessemer that ended with the two deaths.

Officers surrounded a house in Bessemer Thursday night after receiving a domestic violence report from 25-year-old Amy Green, the Michigan State Police said, and as police tried to make contact, Honkala fired at them from inside.

Keegan Miller, the son of Amy Green, was hit by a bullet as he stood outside. He was flown to St. Mary's Hospital in Duluth, Minn., for treatment.

Police eventually went inside and found Green and Honkala dead.

Honkala had been charged in Outagamie County as a result of an assault on Alderman Steve Pack, 56, outside Tanners Bar in Kimberly Oct. 28, 2006.

Pack went out for a smoke and woke up in a hospital. Prosecutors said he was sucker-punched by Honkala and suffered a broken nose, a broken cheekbone, broken eye socket and hairline skull fracture.

Honkala told police he got in a quarrel with his girlfriend and took his anger out on the first person he saw, records show.

Pack said Monday that Green had apologized to him for what happened when he went to the recent court hearing.

"Three weeks ago, at the plea agreement (hearing) she came up to me and said, 'I'm sorry what you've gone through,' " Pack said. "And now she's dead."
