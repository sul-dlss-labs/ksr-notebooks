Metro identifies officer involved in shooting of suicidal man

Metro Police today identified an officer who on Thursday shot a man in the shoulder about the same time the man shot himself in the head after a brief car chase and standoff.

He is Officer Weston Williams, 42, police said. The Clark County coroner’s office has not formally identified the man who died.

The incident began about 10:30 a.m. when a woman called Henderson police to report that her husband was armed and suicidal, police said.

Police there tracked the man’s phone to his car parked outside an auto parts store in the 6000 block of West Charleston Boulevard.

Williams and his partner tried to detain the man, but he sped out of the parking lot, leading the officers on a chase that ended about 1;5 miles away in an alley behind a shopping center in the 200 block of Jones Boulevard, near the U.S. 95, police said.

The man did not respond to orders and pleas from the officers to put his gun down, police said. He then pointed the weapon to his head and gunfire from it, and Williams’ gun fired almost simultaneously.

Williams was reaching to the movement of the man’s gun when he fired the round that hit him in the shoulder, police said.

Metro Capt. Kelly McMahill said the officers involved were upset by the incident. “They wanted this to go a different way, and it just didn’t end up that way today,” she said.

Williams was hired by Metro in November 2006 and is on paid administrative leave while the investigation continues.
