A Hesperia home-invasion robbery suspect died after fighting with two arresting deputies, sheriff’s officials say.

The in-custody death of 47-year-old Stephen Schenck came Monday, Jan. 25, soon after the deputies Tasered and punched him while he was resisting arrest, investigators said in a written statement.

The holdup happened shortly after 4 a.m. Monday along the 8800 block of 11th Avenue where investigators say two intruders — including one armed with a knife — forced their way into a home occupied by four adults and three children.

“The victim defended himself and and his family with a baseball bat,” according to the statement.

During the fight, the victim was cut on his back and both hands, deputies reported.

The intruders fled. But deputies found Schenck hiding beneath a parked bus, where the deputies reported later finding two knives.

“Schenck ignored the deputies commands to come out from under the vehicle and show his hands,” investigators wrote. “As deputies were attempting to take (him) into custody, one deputy initiated a drive stun technique using a Taser, and another deputy applied fist strikes to get the suspect to comply and surrender.”

Deputies were escorting Schenck to a patrol car when he collapsed.

Despite CPR at the scene, Schenck died at a local hospital.

“Schenck and the victim were former business partners,” according to the sheriff’s statement. “Schenck was also the victim’s ex-son-in-law.”

The next day, a second suspect — 33-year-old Apple Valley resident Steven Adams Lawrence — was arrested about 10 p.m. at apartments along the 22200 block of Nisqualli Avenue and booked for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon and robbery, jail records show.
