WARREN, MICHIGAN â€” A "terrible oversight" allowed a drug suspect to smuggle a gun into the police lockup last month, using it to kill a detective and then himself, according to a Warren police report released Thursday.

The report said so many Warren officers had a hand in arresting Ljeka Juncaj--a 29-year-old Sterling Heights man who was caught with 400 pills of the drug ecstasy--that there was confusion about who was supposed to search him.

As a result, nobody properly searched him and he was able to hide a 9 mm handgun in his pants, Warren Police Chief Jim Vohs said in the report.

"The results point to a terrible oversight that allowed the suspect, Ljeka Juncaj, to smuggle in the weapon, and they also suggest some steps that can be taken to ensure that such a tragedy never happens again," Vohs said.

According to witnesses and a surveillance video, Juncaj pulled out the weapon just as Sgt. Christopher Wouters arrived in the booking area, the report said.

Wouters and another officer struggled with Juncaj for the gun, and Juncaj fired a shot, fatally wounding Wouters. As the struggle continued, Juncaj fired again, shooting himself in the head.

Vohs said there will be a review of procedures and additional training for officers.

"We will update our procedures to ensure that in every arrest, one officer is identified as being responsible for the search," Vohs said. Vohs said he doesn't expect any additional discipline for the officers involved.
