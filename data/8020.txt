Erik Garcia, an 18-year-old white man, died when he was shot by a police officer once in the chest on Thursday, April 16, 2009, in the 5700 block of Santa Fe Avenue in Huntington Park, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

Officers had received a call about a man with a gun at a local bar, and when they arrived at the scene Garcia was being escorted out of another bar across the street by security guards, officials said.

Officers ordered Garcia to put his hands on his head, and he did at first, but then he reached for a replica handgun and was shot by a Huntington Park police officer.
