Suspect who shot deputy killed in dumpster in Walnut Park

WALNUT PARK, Calif. (KABC) -- A suspect who fled after shooting a Los Angeles County sheriff's transit services deputy in Walnut Park Saturday was shot to death by deputies.

The incident began in the area of Pacific Boulevard and Grand Avenue at 4:10 a.m. The deputy attempted to contact a pedestrian when the pedestrian produced a firearm and shot the deputy, the sheriff's department said in a statement.

The suspect, later identified as Alberto Cornelio Morales, 41, of Bellflower, fled on foot as the deputy returned fire. It was unknown if Morales was struck, but home surveillance video captured him running through the neighborhood.

The deputy was transported to a local hospital, where he was treated for a non-life-threatening gunshot wound and released.

A containment area was quickly set up, and Morales was located three hours later hiding in a dumpster in the 2700 block of Grand Avenue.

Devinn Chavez lives near the alley where the suspect was found, and witnessed the incident.

"About five or six guys, I think they were cops, came in, opened the dumpster and someone said 'gun' and they shot him," Chavez said.

"The suspect retrieved a firearm again and a second deputy-involved shooting occurred," the sheriff's department said.

Morales was declared dead at the scene.

CORRECTION: It was earlier reported that the suspect was in custody, but the sheriff's department says the suspect died in a deputy-involved shooting.
