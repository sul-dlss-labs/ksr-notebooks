Four officers from the Caldwell Police Department are on leave after the shooting. According to a press release, a shots fired incident was reported at 7:45 Saturday night, but no suspect or evidence of a shooting was found. At around 9:10 p.m., another shots fired call was reported. When officers arrived, Farwell shot at them, and the officers returned fire.

According to a press release, police later learned Farwell argued with his wife earlier that evening. As his wife was leaving, police say he fired a weapon but did not hit her. Farwell then went to a neighbor's house, according to police, where he forced his way into their home and held them at gunpoint.

Farwell shot at a car driving by, injuring a woman with pellets from the shotgun shell. She was treated and released with minor injuries. No officers were injured during the incident.

The case is being investigated by the Critical Incident Task Force led by the Idaho State Police.
