BALTIMORE (WJZ) -- A man was shot and killed by police after he attacked an officer. Police say it all started with a call for a domestic disturbance.

Meghan McCorkell has the latest on the investigation.

Police say the suspect who attacked the officer had a knife nearby. They're still investigating whether he threatened the officer with it.

Police flooded a North Baltimore neighborhood after one of their own called for help. The officer was responding to a 911 call about a violent fight at a Weldon Place home. Inside, he encountered a man and woman struggling. Neighbors say the woman is pregnant. The man turned on the officer and attacked him. A knife was nearby.

"The officer who was being attacked did summon the other officer to assist him. The other officer fired at least one round to the suspect," said Baltimore City Police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

The 40-year-old suspect, identified as Johnathan Blankenship, was killed.

Neighbors say the community is so quiet, they didn't recognize the gunshots.

"The kids actually said they were on the front porch and my son got scared because he's scared of fireworks and she said, `Oh, it's probably just fireworks.' So they probably heard it," said Trishia Damico.

The couple lived in the second unit at the Weldon Townhomes. Neighbors say they'd only been living there for about two weeks.

"I knew her. I didn't know him. I don't even know what he looks like," said one neighbor.

"He made a...decision that she'll have to live with for the rest of her life with the baby," Damico said.

It's a decision that cost one man his life.

The officer who was attacked suffered scrapes and bruises. The pregnant woman was not hurt.

This is the seventh deadly police-involved shooting in Baltimore this year.
