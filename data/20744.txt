State authorities are investigating the fatal shooting by law enforcement of a man who reportedly was wielding a knife during a confrontation in McCurtain County.

A man, identified as Daniel Francisco Valenzuela, 37, forced his way into a residence in Millerton on Wednesday afternoon, according to an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation news release.

Police were dispatched to the residence on reports of a domestic altercation.

When confronted by officers, Valenzuela allegedly ignored commands to drop the knife. Police said Valenzuela threatened officers with the knife and came toward them, according to the OSBI release.

A McCurtain County deputy and a Valliant police officer, who had both responded to the call, shot Valenzuela, the release says.

Emergency responders transported Valenzuela to a hospital, where he died.

The McCurtain County district attorney requested that OSBI investigate the shooting.
