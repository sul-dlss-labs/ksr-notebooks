(LOUISVILLE, January 14th, 2003, 6:30 p.m.) -- A striking GE employee protesting healthcare costs was struck and killed by a police cruiser early Tuesday morning. The accident happened just before 5 a.m. near Gate One of Appliance Park on Fegenbush Lane. Shannon Davidson reports.

Louisville Metro Police spokesman Dwight Mitchell says the woman was carrying a picket sign in a dimly lit area when she was struck by a cruiser from nearby Hollow Creek, a tiny suburban city of about 800 people. Mitchell identified the driver as Roy Truax. Hollow Creek officials confirmed that Truax is chief of the city's two-man police department.

According to police, initial eyewitness reports indicate that the woman stepped into the roadway when she was struck.

The woman died at the scene from multiple trauma. She was identified as 40-year-old Kjeston Michelle Rodgers.

"The lady was out here doing something she believed in," said Dave Riddle, who was part of the picket at the same plant gate where the accident happened. "It hurts our entire family at GE to lose a worker like that, especially in tragedy, in a situation like this.

Company officials had this to say about the death. "Our thoughts and prayers are with the family and we'll be working with the family to provide benefits and assistance to get through this very difficult time," said Appliance Park CEO Jim Campbell.

Other strikers say that, despite the tragedy, they don't plan to lose their focus, and will continue fighting for what they believe in, just as their co-worker was doing when she was killed before she lost her life.

A cross with a wreath was placed at the spot on where the woman was struck.

Rodgers had been an employee at Appliance Park's Dishwashing Unit since 1994. She leaves behind three young children.
