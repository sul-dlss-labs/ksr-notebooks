A man shot and killed himself Sunday night after Madison police were unsuccessful in preventing him from doing so.

The shooting happened about 6:40 p.m. in the 3200 block of Stonecreek Drive on the city's southwest side.

Madison police were called to the scene after a report of a suspicious person in a vehicle.

"Officers found the subject sitting in the vehicle armed with a handgun," said Lt. Dan Olivas in a report released early Monday morning. "Officers were attempting to gain control of the subject when the subject fired a single round, striking himself."

The man was taken to University of Wisconsin Hospital, where efforts to revive him were unsuccessful.
