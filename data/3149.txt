The Washington State Patrol identified a woman who died after fleeing police near the Interstate 205/Interstate 5 split on Tuesday.

Mariah K. Hurse, 21, was driving southbound on I-205 in a 2005 Mitshubishi Endeavor SUV, evading a trooper who had tried to pull her over for speeding at around 9:40 a.m.

Hurse was near the I-205/I-5 junction when she lost control. The vehicle drove out of the left lane, ran into the median, rolled at least once and hit a tree before coming to a stop on its roof.

Hurse was ejected from the vehicle and died from the resulting injuries.

No other vehicles were involved in the crash.

The Milton Police Department had reported the SUV stolen that morning.
