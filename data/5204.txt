A man a Santa Ana officer stopped for questioning in a drug and robbery incident died early Wednesday while in custody, the department said.

The encounter occurred about 2 a.m. in the 1600 block of East 1st Street, said Sgt Lorenzo Carrillo.

During questioning, the officer drove the man to Leonardo Inn Suites in the 2200 block of East 1st Street, where the man fell on the ground in convulsions. Police would not say why they went to the hotel.

Paramedics took the man to a hospital where he died, Carrillo said.

At no point during the encounter, Carrillo said, did the officer issue a radio report that he was using force, which department policy requires. The manager of the hotel, Mike Boyajian, said his employees said they didn’t see any violence between the man and the officer.

The man’s identity was not released because his family had not been notified, the coroner’s office said.

The officer’s name was not released pending an investigation by the district attorney.
