A police sergeant shot and killed a man in Washington Heights last night after the man ignored orders to put down a shotgun he was holding and ran off instead, law enforcement officials said.

About 7:20 p.m., the police responded to a report of a man with a gun at West 174th Street and Audubon Avenue. They found a man armed with a sawed-off shotgun and ordered him to put it down, the police said.

The man ran, and the police chased him, Sergeant Ralph Carone, a spokesman, said. A conflict ensued, Assistant Chief Nicholas Estavillo said at a news conference last night.

One officer, a plainclothes sergeant, fired one round from his gun, striking the man in the chest. The man, Juan Mendez, was taken to Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, where he died from his injures at 7:50 p.m. The sergeant's gun and the shotgun, which was loaded, have been recovered, Sergeant Carone said.
