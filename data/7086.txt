An Elgin man fleeing at least two police cars was killed when his car hit a semitrailer truck head-on in Hampshire, police said Friday.

Ricardo Castillo-Torres, 21, of the 400 block of Ashland Avenue, was pronounced dead at the scene Thursday after the 4-mile chase. The driver of the truck was treated and released from Provena St. Joseph Hospital in Elgin.

"We're not sure yet" how fast they were traveling, said Lt. Pat Gengler of the Kane County Sheriff's Department. "He was pulling away from officers, and it went pretty quickly."

A Pingree Grove police officer tried to stop Castillo-Torres around 11:30 p.m. Thursday at Illinois Highways 47 and 72 because of a traffic violation, said Pingree Grove Police Chief Carol Lussky.

The officer turned on the siren and tried to stop the car, but it sped westbound on Illinois 72. Hampshire police joined in the chase.

As Castillo-Torres' car approached State Street in Hampshire, he drove into the eastbound lane of traffic and slammed into the truck, police said. Castillo-Torres, who was not wearing a seat belt, did not have a valid driver's license, according to a spokeswoman for the Illinois secretary of state's office.

Gengler said they are waiting for toxicology reports to determine if alcohol was involved.

The Kane County Sheriff's Department is investigating.
