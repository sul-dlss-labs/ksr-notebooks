A man was killed and two other people were injured after he drove away from an attempted traffic stop and crashed in Huntsville this morning, police said.

The crash happened around 10:30 a.m. on Old Monrovia Road near the AMC Threatre. Montarious Rooks, a 29-year-old man from Madison County, was killed, according to Huntsville police.

Rooks drove away from police and crashed with another driver, said Huntsville police Lt. Michael Johnson.

Rooks and a passenger in his vehicle were taken to the hospital, Johnson said. The passenger was seriously injured, though their condition wasnâ€™t clear Thursday evening.

The driver of the other vehicle suffered minor injuries, Johnson said.

The situation began when a Huntsville police officer turned on his blue lights and tried to stop the vehicle Rooks was driving for a tag violation, Johnson said. Instead of pulling over, police said, Rooks sped away. The officer began chasing the car, Johnson said, but stopped at a red light because of concerns about continuing a high-speed chase in the high-traffic area.

Within a couple of minutes, police were called to a crash nearby, and the officer recognized the vehicle as the one he had been chasing, Johnson said.

This story was updated on May 28 at 9:36 p.m. with the identity of the driver who was killed.
