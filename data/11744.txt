An investigation is underway following an officer-involved shooting in Seminole.

The Oklahoma Bureau of Investigation said a Seminole County law enforcement officer attempted to serve a felony warrant for Randall Palmer at his home in Seminole about 7 p.m. Saturday.

Palmer's 24-year-old son Aaron Palmer confronted the officer with a knife, a news release from OSBI said.

The officer fired once at Aaron Palmer, striking him in the chest. Aaron Palmer was transported to a hospital in Shawnee and died.

OSBI agents conducted interviews at the scene, including a Seminole police officer who was also helping serve the failure to comply with drug court warrant. That warrant had a $100,000 bond attached.

At the conclusion of the OSBI investigation, the district attorney will determine whether the shooting was justified.
