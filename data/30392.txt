A man has died after an off-duty Phoenix police officer shot him while the man aimed a gun at suspected shoplifters.

William Brookins, 39, died on June 8 after being hospitalized following the June 3 shooting, Phoenix police spokesman Sgt. Andy Williams confirmed to The Arizona Republic Monday.

Brookins aimed at the pair believed to have shoplifted from a nearby business when the officer — who the department previously said was in full uniform directing traffic nearby — intervened, according to the newspaper.

That unnamed officer, who has been with the department roughly four years, ordered Brookins to drop his weapon multiple times and upon the order being ignored, shot the man, according to the outlet.

Brookins, who did not work at the business believed to have been shoplifted, was the only person injured or killed in the shooting, The Arizona Republic reports.

The business in question had not been robbed, police told the paper.
