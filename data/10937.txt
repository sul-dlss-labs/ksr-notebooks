BRIGHTON, Colo. (CBS4) - Adams County investigators are looking into an officer-involved shooting that left one person dead in Brighton.

The incident happened just before 9 p.m. on Saturday. Authorities said a Brighton police officer shot an armed man who was coming at him.

It all started about an hour earlier at a 7-Eleven on East Bridge Street on a call that a man was threatening someone with a gun. By the time officers arrived the man was gone.

Less than a half hour later there were reports of shots fired and another threatening incident at a Diamond Shamrock on East Bromley Lane. This time an officer spotted a car racing from the scene and chased it when the driver refused to pull over. After stop sticks flattened the suspect's tires he stopped in the 3200 block of 144th Avenue where police say he got out holding a gun.

Police said the man ignored repeated requests to drop the gun and began walking toward officers when he was shot.

The 36-year-old suspect's name has not been released.
