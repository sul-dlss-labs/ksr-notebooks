Deputies from the Pima County Sheriff's Department are investigating a deputy-involved shooting on the south side of Tucson.

PCSD says an adult male suspect was pronounced dead on scene. No deputies were injured during the incident.

Deputy Ryan Inglett, a spokesman for the department, says before the deputy-involved shooting they responded to the Circle K at 9810 South Nogales Highway for a report of an armed robbery.

Upon their arrival, a man was found, armed with a gun, standing behind an employee inside the store. The suspect exited the store with the employee, and the employee ran toward a deputy who was waiting outside.

The suspect was shot by deputies.

Officials learned the man was connected to a homicide that happened in the 3800 block of South Palm Side Drive.

The PCSD Homicide Unit is investigating. No other information is currently available.
