TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A man who allegedly shot at a state trooper before fleeing died after he shot himself in the head, authorities said.



Trevor Clifton Wilkerson died at St. John Medical Center about 3 p.m. Tuesday, Tulsa Police Sgt. Wayne Allen said.



One of "Tulsa's Most Wanted," Wilkerson had been accused of trying to shoot a police officer.



About 11:30 p.m. Monday, Oklahoma Highway Trooper George McCreary stopped a car in east Tulsa for a traffic violation, Officer Lucky Lamons said. Wilkerson, a back-seat passenger in the car, got out of the car and allegedly fired one shot at the trooper. Wilkerson then ran into a neighborhood, Lamons said.



Wilkerson missed, and McCreary was not injured, officials said.



A motorist told police that the suspect had gotten a ride to a nearby residence and officers set up a perimeter around the Bristol Park Apartments. Lamons said the apartment did not have a phone, so officers used a loudspeaker to try to contact Wilkerson.



"Several announcements were made, and then one shot was heard.



Two men came out of the apartment and told the officers that Trevor had shot himself," Lamons said.



The men had not been held hostage in the apartment. Wilkerson was charged Sept. 22 with pointing a gun and attempting to fire it at police during a previous traffic stop.



"We were looking for him on those charges when this happened,"



Lamons said.



According to police reports of the earlier shooting, Wilkerson was a passenger in a vehicle that police pulled over and pulled a gun and attempted to fire at officers.



Police took cover, and Wilkerson fled. Lamons said police examined the gun and found that it had jammed.
