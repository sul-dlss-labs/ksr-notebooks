Clovis, NM - A traffic stop in Clovis turns into a police chase, ending with one man dead.

New Mexico State Police say they've learned 29-year-old Benjamin Selgado had outstanding warrants for felony possession of a firearm and trafficking of a controlled substance, which may have been why he fled.

Selgado was initially being pulled over for speeding Sunday afternoon when he reportedly led police on a short vehicle chase near 7th and Prince Street.

Authorities tell us the suspect jumped out of his vehicle and continued to flee on foot near the 1500 block of Mabry.

After jumping a fence into a motel parking lot, police tell us Selgado reportedly ran behind a corner and approached officer Bryan Conner with a hand-gun.

Selgado was shot three times and died at the scene.

"At this point we've completed a majority of the investigation. Investigators will continue to follow up on any additional interviews and anything they need to do. We will compile the reports and it will be referred to the District Attorneys Office for review," says Cpt. Jimmy Glascock, New Mexico State Police Department.

State police say they have followed proper protocol by placing officer Conner on three days of administrative leave.

NewsChannel 10 spoke with Selgado's uncle who is saddened over the incident and says he has many unanswered questions.
