Man found dead after police standoff in Fort Wayne

FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) – A four-hour standoff with a man inside a home on High Street ended after he was found dead.

According to 24-Hour News 8 sister station, WANE, police were called to the 900 block of High Street around 5:40 p.m. for a domestic dispute.

According to FWPD Spokesman Officer Jason Anthony, police were told a husband and wife was arguing inside the home. At some point, the man pointed a loaded handgun at his wife and she ran from the home.

Arriving officers attempted to get the man to come out, but he refused.

The department’s Emergency Services and Crisis Response Teams were called around 6:15 p.m.

Officers used a loud speaker, flash bang device and tear gas in an attempt to get the man to come out of the home. After those attempts, police said the man was not responding to any commands to exit the residence.

Around 9:45 p.m. officers sent a robot into the home and found the man on the first floor. He was unresponsive and appeared to be bleeding. Officers then went inside the home and paramedics pronounced him dead.

Anthony said it appeared the man suffered a single gunshot wound and the Allen County Coroner will determine an exact cause and manner of death.

The identity of the man has not been released.

Anthony said Crime Scene Technicians gathered evidence at the home which will help further the investigation.

Neighbors near the home were evacuated during the standoff. They were allowed to return home shortly before 10 p.m.

The incident is under investigation by the Fort Wayne Police Department, Allen County Prosecutor’s Office, and the Allen County Coroner.
