The day after Daniel Ashworth was shot and killed by Westminster police, his mother carried on with the task that should have signified a new start, but now marked a tragic ending.

Still numb, Dolores Pollard watched Sunday as her grandson – Ashworth’s son – carried her belongings to a rented U-Haul truck. Pollard and Ashworth were supposed to move to a new home in Riverside this weekend.

Ashworth, 37, diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic, was locked in a tug of war with the disease for much of his adult life, said Pollard. She blamed the mental illness, and a change in medication, for the events leading to her son’s death Saturday.

After his illness was diagnosed in 2002, he was put on medication that helped control his schizophrenia. But last year, his medication was changed, and his symptoms began to worsen, Pollard said.

“There is nothing like losing your child,” said Pollard, who was concerned that Ashworth would be remembered only for his final act and not as the caring son she knew. “I loved my son very much.”

On Saturday morning, Ashworth used a handgun and shotgun to critically wound his brother-in-law, Troy Moore, 39, who was helping the family move. Ashworth walked up to Moore, who was carrying a chest of drawers, and shot him in the back. When Moore ran outside, Ashworth shot him again.

Moore was listed Sunday in good condition at UCI Medical Center in Orange.

Westminster police arrived at the family’s home in the Village Greens complex at 11:40 a.m. Saturday and found Ashworth with the shotgun in hand near the moving van. They ordered him to drop the weapon, but instead he aimed the gun at police, witnesses said. Several officers then shot him multiple times.

“He’s gone now,” said Pollard, a supervisor at Orange County Superior Court. “It’s devastated a lot of lives – mine, his son’s, his daughter’s, his sister’s.”
