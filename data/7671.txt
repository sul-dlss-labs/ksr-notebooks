Salvador Zepeda Alarcon, an 18-year-old Latino man, was shot and killed by sheriff's deputies in the 800 block of North Humphreys Avenue in East Los Angeles on Sunday, Nov. 30, 2008, according to sheriff's officials.

Alarcon, of East Los Angeles, allegedly pulled a handgun on deputies who were responding to a report of shots fired shortly after 2 a.m., Deputy Oscar Butao said.

Deputies from the East Los Angeles station were traveling west on Folsom Street when they saw Alarcon running east. They got out of their vehicle and ordered Alarcon to stop, Butao said, but he ignored them, drew a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at them.

The deputies fired several rounds, hitting Alarcon in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Butao said.

Los Angeles County coroner's officials said Alarcon appeared to have been struck by five bullets.
