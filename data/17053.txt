As law enforcement officials started a drug raid Wednesday in Lewisville, Ark., a suspect apparently committed suicide by gunshot, according to reports.

"About 3 p.m., we initiated a search warrant on East 31st Street. We took the door in, and he took his own life," Layfayette County Sheriff Obie Sims said.

Guy Barlow, 56, of Lewisville, Ark., was the gunshot victim, officials said.

Officers found an estimated $50,000 worth of marijuana growing in the house.

Sims said Barlow had

an "elaborate" growing system in the house.

Barlow was also wanted on felony warrants from California.

"I know one of the department's special agents is assigned to a death investigation assisting local law enforcement," said Bill Sadler, a spokesman with the Arkansas State Police.

Barlow's body has been sent to the Arkansas Crime Lab for an autopsy.

The investigation included the Lafayette County Sheriff's Department, Lewisville Police Department, Stamps Police Department, Arkansas State Police, Southwest Arkansas Drug System and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission.
