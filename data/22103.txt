LOS ANGELES — The coroner’s office today released the name of an armed man found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after he was holed up in his South Los Angeles apartment, prompting the evacuations of at least 20 people.

He was Rigoberto Barbosa Jr., 28, according to the coroner’s office. An autopsy was pending.

The standoff began around 12:45 a.m. Thursday in the area of San Pedro Street and Gage Avenue, police said. Officers went to the location in response to a report that a man had assaulted a neighbor and fired shots in the air.

The man now identified as Barbosa pointed a handgun at arriving officers and retreated into the building, police said. Residents were evacuated, and SWAT officers tried to talk the man into surrendering.

The man was found dead about 4:45 a.m., according to police and the coroner’s office.

Authorities had fired rubber bullets to scare the suspect, and a robot was sent into the apartment to determine if the man was alive.
