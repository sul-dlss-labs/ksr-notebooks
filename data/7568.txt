Abraham Sanchez, a 33-year old Latino man, was fatally shot by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy from the Century station shortly before midnight Oct. 17, 2008, in the 11600 block of South Atlantic Avenue in Lynwood, according to sheriff's records.

Sanchez, who had been shot in the torso, was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead early the next morning.

Detectives investigating the officer-involved shooting reported that two deputies assigned to the Century station had been flagged down by an informant who told them someone was breaking into a nearby business.

Once at the location, investigators said the deputies told them that they found the front window broken. At that point, the deputies said they called for backup, according to a sheriff's report.

"During this time a male Hispanic suspect exited the front of the business through the broken window," according to the report dated Oct. 18, 2008. "When the deputy ordered the suspect to stop, the suspect quickly reached into his waistband and began removing what appeared to be a weapon."

At that point, the report states, the deputy fired one shot, hitting the man in the upper torso.

A jagged, 8-inch piece of concrete was recovered at the scene, the report states.
