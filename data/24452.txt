KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Two Kansas City men died early Friday morning after a crash in the Grandview Triangle.

It happened along the exit ramp from eastbound I-435 to north 71-Highway just after 1 a.m.

Investigators say a 911 caller reported a group of around five to six women physically fighting in parking lot of the Soul Lounge at 99th and Holmes. When police arrived at the bar, the driver and another man in a white Ford Explorer sped off.

“I think there were several parties involved, and their role–if any–isn’t known at this point,” Sgt. Bill Mahoney of the Kansas City Police Department.

Officers went after them, but they were called off after doing a check of the driver. They lost sight of the SUV as they drove on to the eastbound entrance ramp of I-435 and Holmes.

Another officer drove by the scene of the crash moments after the vehicle went over the metal guardrail and crashed into a concrete pillar. The vehicle started smoking.

Two men, later identified as 31-year-old Willie E. Hill and 32-year-old Kenney L. Spencer, were trapped inside and died.
