Police shot dead an 18-year- old Harlem man running with a gun in his hand early yesterday after he refused orders to stop, officials said.

Mingo Kenneth Mason was shot once in the neck as he ran from cops just before 1 a.m. He was declared dead at Metropolitan Hospital. A .25-caliber handgun was recovered at the scene, police said.

The incident began when police received a 911 call about a man walking through the East River Housing Project.

At first, two housing police responded and encountered four men walking through a hallway of 420 E. 105th St., who bolted when confronted, knocking one of the officers down, police said.

Then two officers from the 23rd Precinct joined the chase, and followed Mason to East 102nd Street, where they ordered him to stop. When he kept going, an officer fired a single shot, police said.

Witnesses disputed the police account, saying Mason – who just got out of jail in July for robbery charges and was facing assault charges from a separate incident – stopped when ordered to do so.

“He stopped and put his hands up. After that they shot him,” said Bobby West, 28, a paralegal standing on the street at the time. “I didn’t see a gun. Kenny’s not a gun kid. He’s not a thug. You could talk him down.”
