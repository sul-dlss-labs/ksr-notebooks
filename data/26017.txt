OGDEN — Authorities on Saturday identified a man who died in a crash after he led police on a short chase Friday evening.

Jacob Michael Erebia, 24, was pulled over by an officer about 7 p.m. but “attempted to flee while the officer was speaking to him,” Ogden police said in a statement released Friday.

The officer was dragged by the vehicle and suffered minor injuries while Erebia “fled at a high rate of speed.”

Erebia lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a traffic pole. He died at the scene of the accident, authorities said.

Police identified Erebia in a tweet Saturday morning.

Further details about the crash were not immediately available.
