AURORA, Colo. (AP) - A man shot dead by police in a hotel parking lot had led authorities on high-speed pursuits twice in the past three weeks and promised a shootout.

Daniel Dawson, 26, was shot dead early Wednesday after allegedly firing on police who had been tracking him. Dawson was wanted on three outstanding arrest warrants and for investigation in a string of drug crimes and car thefts.

"He was prolific in the Denver metro area in criminal activity," said Aurora Deputy Police Chief Terry Jones. "This shooting was just one piece of a larger puzzle he is involved in."

Aurora officers Anthony Martinez, Eric Bond and Sean Mitchell were placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard following a deadly shooting. Neither Bond or Mitchell had been involved in a shooting before.

But Martinez had shot and killed another suspect at the same hotel four years ago. In the 2000 incident, he struggled with, then shot and killed an armed gunman who had fired at Martinez's head from close range.

Police said Dawson told acquaintances he had body armor.

"Mr. Dawson was ready to engage the police in an out-and-out shootout," Jones said. "He was rather heavily involved in criminal behavior and was a very dangerous individual. He had no regard for anyone but himself and his associates."

After the shooting, police found two guns and no body armor.

Jones could not immediately verify reports that Dawson had been shot 19 times. The Arapahoe County Coroner's Office said Dawson died of gunshot wounds.

Dawson was wanted on three outstanding warrants, including felony escape and two contempt of court charges.
