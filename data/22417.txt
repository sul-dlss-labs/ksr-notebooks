DYER | Dyer police shot and killed a man armed with an assault rifle Friday night in the Briar Ridge gated community, authorities said Saturday.

Dean Tsatsos, 40, died of a single gunshot to the head in a field behind his parents' home in the 1200 block of Killarney Drive, Lake County Coroner David Pastrick said. Tsatsos died at the scene late Friday night, Pastrick said.

Lake County Police Chief Marco Kuyachich said Dyer police asked the Sheriff's Department to examine the matter. He said area police departments routinely call in another agency to ensure an independent investigation.

Kuyachich said his department's detectives preliminarily have determined the incident began Friday evening when Tsatsos got into a physical confrontation with his father inside their home.

He said Tsatsos' father threatened to call police. Tsatsos apparently called 911 himself, then ran out of a back door with an assault weapon before Dyer officers arrived, he said.

Kuyachich said Dyer officers pursued and confronted Tsatsos into a nearby field within Briar Ridge and ordered him to drop the weapon.

"Instead, he turned it toward the officers, and they fired," Kuyachich said.

A neighbor reported hearing gunshots sometime before 10 p.m.

Kuyachich said there was a preliminary indication by officers at the scene that Tsatsos' gun was unloaded, but he still is awaiting a definitive determination from the county police crime lab.
