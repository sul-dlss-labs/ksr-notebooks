COLTON >> Police revealed details Friday two weeks after a chase led to a fatal shooting.

Shortly after 5:30 p.m. on the night of Sept. 12 police were chasing a reported stolen car throughout the city.

The situation became deadly when chase ended in the 900 block of East C Street in front of Washington High School.

Officers had stepped from their patrol car to take cover and make an arrest when the stolen car lunged forward ramming the patrol car pushing it into one of the officers.

Officers fearing for their lives opened fire striking both the driver, Joseph Carter, 32, and passenger Christian Vargas, 25, both of Colton, police spokesman Cpl. Ray Mendez said Friday.

Once shots were fired, first-aid tactics were initiated by the two officers on scene until medics arrived.

Both suspects were taken to an area hospital. Vargas succumbed to his wounds, Mendez said.

Sheriffâ€™s officials continue to investigate the shooting.

Carter is being held at West Valley Detention Center on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, grand theft, evasion, possession of a stolen vehicle, wrong-way driving.

Carter is being held in lieu of $350,000 bail, as well as on a no-bail warrant, according to jail records.

Neither officer was seriously injured and both are back to full duty.
