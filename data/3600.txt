Lollis case going to grand jury Published 12:00 am Thursday, December 9, 2004

VIDALIA, La. &045; Starting Dec. 13 a parish grand jury will determine the next step in the investigation into the Aug. 23 Ferriday shooting of Frederick Ron Lollis by a Concordia Parish Sheriff’s deputy.

The jurors have been selected at random and will start their six-month term in December. Any cases that come up during the next six months will be heard by this grand jury.

District Attorney Investigator Paul Scott said the investigation is still continuing even though most of the work has been done. The DA’s office and the State Police handled the investigation at the request of Sheriff Randy Maxwell.

Investigators will present all they have to the grand jury, which will return a decision. Grand juries can either say there is enough evidence to formally charge a person with a crime, say there needs to be more investigation or fail to return an indictment, meaning no charges are filed.

&uot;It’s not just a stamped seal,&uot; Scott said. &uot;We put on every bit of the evidence we have at the time to see if it is enough to file formal charges.&uot;

Lollis, who was black, was shot and killed by a white Concordia Parish Sheriff’s Deputy on Doty Road.

After the shooting many people in the Ferriday community said the shooting was racially motivated.

Maxwell has said the deputy was responding to a harassment call involving Lollis and Lollis pulled a gun on the deputy. A gun was found at the scene.

The FBI is also investigating the matter as a civil rights violation but has not released its findings.

The deputy, David Hedrick, has been put on administrative leave until the conclusion of the investigation.
