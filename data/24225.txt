An armed man was fatally shot by Livonia police on Friday night after allegedly leading officers on a chase, investigators reported.

Westland police had started pursuing a driver described as suicidal and carrying a handgun about 7:45 p.m. but ended the chase near Hix and Joy roads, officials said in a statement.

The man was later seen running in a residential neighborhood north of the intersection in Livonia, prompting officers to set up a perimeter to find him, according to the release.

They spotted the driver running with a handgun and ordered him to stop, but he fled, police said.

While trying to arrest him nearby, an officer fired a shot, striking the man. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Other details were not released.

Livonia and Plymouth Township authorities as well as Michigan State Police are investigating.

The incident is the second fatal officer-involved shooting in Metro Detroit this week.

On Monday, a Royal Oak man was fatally shot following a domestic violence incident involving his parents.
