DETROIT (WWJ) -- A barricaded gunman situation involving a murder suspect on Detroit's west side has come to an end after he took his own life, police said.

Police said he was found inside the home with a self-inflicted gunshot wound early Friday evening.

Detroit Police Chief James White said officers tried to stop the wanted man around noon, in the area of Ewald Circle and Oakman Blvd., when he fled to a nearby gas station.

The suspect then encountered an uninvolved citizen, police said, telling the citizen he needed to borrow a phone because of a domestic incident.

Having no idea police were looking for the suspect, the man took the suspect home and allowed him to use his phone. That's when the suspect came clean, admitting that he was on the run from police.

While the citizen was able to get out of the home unharmed, White said the suspect remained inside the house and was believed to be armed and dangerous.

Whiter said the DOD's Crisis Intervention Team, which social workers who specialize in mental illness. was called in to assist.

"We are in the process now of negotiating with him...and hopefully we can bring this to a peaceful resolution," the chief said during the standoff. "But we're gonna be here; we're going to try our best to wait him out. But if he's watching, at this point he should just give himself up."

In a tweet earlier this afternoon, DPD said Michigan State Police had assisted in closing the ramps to I-96 and the Davison Freeway to traffic in response to the situation.

WWJ learned the standoff ended around 7 p.m.
