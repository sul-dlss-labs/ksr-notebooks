MIAMI, FL — A 19-year-old woman was killed Wednesday afternoon in a wild police chase through northwest Miami-Dade. Police said that the woman was riding in a stolen BMW that was spotted by police heading west on NW 79 Street. Winny Victor was killed when the car crashed through a fence and rolled over multiple times.

"A records check of the tag revealed that the vehicle was reported stolen, at which time detectives initiated a traffic stop at NW 6 Avenue," said Detective Alvaro Zabaleta of the Miami-Dade Police Department. The driver of the stolen BMW was identified as 18-year-old Zaykesse Johnson, who was listed in good condition at Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center.

"As detectives approached the vehicle, the subject accelerated forward, striking the detective's vehicle. He then fled westbound on NW 79 Street at a high rate of speed, where he struck a civilian vehicle at NW 22 Avenue, and continued to flee southbound," Zabaleta said. Zabaleta added that the driver of the damaged vehicle joined in the police chase. "The civilian vehicle, unaware that the subject was fleeing from police, began to follow the subject vehicle," according to Zabaleta. "The subject lost control of the BMW in the area of NW 71 Street, where he drove through a fence and into an open field. The vehicle overturned several times, ejecting the driver and the passenger."

Victor was taken to Ryder Trauma by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue where she died of her injuries.
