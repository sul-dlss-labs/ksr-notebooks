CLEVELAND, Ohio -- One person was killed and another critically injured in a four-vehicle crash on Ohio 43 Tuesday afternoon, according to the Ravenna post of the State Highway Patrol.

Nadia N. Campbell, 26, of Cleveland, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. Officials said she was a passenger in a Chrysler Pacifica driven by Frank L. Tindell, 34, of Cleveland. He was critically injured and taken to Akron City Hospital by helicopter, Highway Patrol Sgt. Troy Homrighausen said.

The Pacifica was traveling south on Ohio 43 shortly after 1:30 p.m. when it drove left of center and struck the trailer of a Mack truck, Homrighausen said. The Pacifica came back into its lane and hit a Ford Explorer, forcing it off the road, he said. The vehicle drove left of center again and struck a Freightliner truck head-on, Homrighausen said.

Prior to the crash, Aurora police were called to investigate a reported shoplifting at the Aurora Farms Outlets when a Chrysler Pacifica matching a description of the suspect's vehicle sped away from the scene, Homrighausen said.

He said Aurora officers were trailing about 10 seconds behind the vehicle when the crash occurred and were "never close enough to be in a pursuit," according to witnesses.

The patrol said dash cam footage from the incident was not available Tuesday night.

Homrighausen said neither Tindell or Campbell was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

The driver of the Mack truck, Michael Kalinowski, 58, of Homerville, Ohio, was uninjured in the crash, Homrighausen said. The driver of the Ford Explorer, David C. George, 83, of Streetsboro, and the driver of the Freightliner, Kenneth Bestoe, 65, of Ravenna, both suffered minor injuries and were taken to Robinson Memorial Hospital, according to the patrol.

The patrol does not believe alcohol or drugs were factors in the crash, which remains under investigation.
