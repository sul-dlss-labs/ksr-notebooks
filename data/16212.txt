On June 8, 2015, at approximately 6:50 pm, 911 received calls regarding the complainant running in traffic, touching cars, and foaming at the mouth. DFR Rescue 32 had answered a service call nearby and encountered the complainant who began pounding on the hood of the ambulance. Rescue 32 pulled into a parking lot and the paramedics began trying to speak with the complainant. He was not cooperative and continued to behave erratically and foam at the mouth. The paramedics called 911 requesting a police response code 3. About the same time officers arrived, the complainant entered a vehicle owned by a witness who did not know the complainant. Officers attempted to talk the complainant out of the vehicle, but he refused. When officers removed the complainant from the vehicle, he resisted so officers used a TASER to take him into custody. The complainant was hit with two bursts from the TAZER and taken into custody. At this point, the complainant became unresponsive. He was transported to Baylor Hospital by DFR where he was pronounced deceased. At the time of this notification, no autopsy or toxicology reports have been completed. Case number 130666-2015.
