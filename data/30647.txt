Palm Beach County Sheriff's announced the name of the suspect Monday who died after shooting at deputies Friday. Investigators said Marcus Pettis, 23, killed himself.PBSO Chief Deputy Frank DeMario said the altercation began just before 4 p.m. when investigators pulled over a car at the corner of Evergreen Drive and 9th Street in Lake Park.DeMario said the passenger in the car was wanted on a felony drug charge and was also a suspect in a homicide.Deputies said the traffic stop immediately got violent.“Jumped out of the car and started shooting at us,” DeMario said. “I don’t know how many rounds, six or seven, but he did it in several different locations.”DeMario said no deputies were shot, and they did return fire. He said the man was not shot as he ran away, continuing to shoot at the deputies.The man was found a short time later about a block and a half down the road, motionless on the outside of the second floor of an apartment building.“We thought he was wounded,” DeMario said. “When we got up there, he had committed suicide.”The sheriff’s office released a photo of the gun they said the man used.It was a Glock semi-automatic with an extended magazine, which deputies said gave the man extra firepower.A large crowd gathered outside the crime scene as investigators worked to gather evidence.Bryce Graham, a representative from a civil rights group called the National Action Network, joined the crowd, promising to follow the case closely.“I want to call for the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office to be transparent with our community,” said Graham.The name of the person who died has not yet been released.The two deputies who fired their weapons have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol in all deputy shootings.The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will lead the investigation into the shooting.
