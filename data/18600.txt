A burglary suspect died of a preexisting condition Friday night after being arrested during a scuffle in Fort Sanders with bystanders and police, according to Knoxville Police Department spokesman Darrell DeBusk.

"Based on the preliminary autopsy report the suspect had no physical injuries that would have been fatal," a KPD news release read. "It appears at this time that a preexisting heart condition and excited delirium were significant factors in his death. It is important to note that the toxicology report is not complete and the results may shed more light on the factors contributing to the suspect's death."

The suspect's identity is still unknown, and authorities say investigators are awaiting the results from fingerprints to help confirm his identity.

His body was taken to the Knox County Regional Forensic Center for an autopsy by the medical examiner to determine the cause of death.

The incident began when two men called E-911 about 8:14 p.m. when they caught the man breaking into an apartment in the 1200 block of Laurel Avenue, according to DeBusk.

The burglary suspect tried to discard a duffel bag full of stolen items and then attacked them in front of the building. The three men were struggling, and the suspect was on the ground when police arrived about 8:19 p.m.

"The suspect continued to resist as officers attempted to place him into custody," according to DeBusk.

"Once detained the male began experiencing physical distress and was transported to Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center. The suspect was pronounced deceased at the hospital."

Multiple stolen items and identifications were recovered from the man and the duffel bag, according to DeBusk.

Police say the name of the suspect will be released once he has been identified and his next-of-kin have been notified.
