A 33-year-old San Diego motorist was killed in Alhambra on Thursday while trying to run from a Highway Patrol officer who was citing him for a carpool violation, authorities said.

The man, who had been standing with his vehicle and the officer, dashed across the westbound lanes of the San Bernardino Freeway east of Fremont Avenue, California Highway Patrol Sgt. Kevin Gordon said.

“He got as far as the carpool lane when he was struck by a passing Honda at about 9:10 a.m.,” he said.

The driver of that car, Terria M. Jones of Fontana, suffered minor facial cuts, Gordon said. The freeway was partially blocked for about 2 1/2 hours.

The victim’s identity was being withheld pending notification of his next of kin and an investigation into his background.

“We’ve found conflicting information about who the man might be,” Gordon said. “We have several names for him, which we obtained at the scene, and from information he provided us.”
