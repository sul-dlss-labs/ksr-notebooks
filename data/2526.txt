MONSON, Mass. -- A Monson police sergeant who fatally shot and killed a man brandishing a barbecue fork inside a strip club will not face criminal charges, prosecutors say.

Sgt. Robert K. Shuemaker was justified in shooting Mark C. Merrill of Monson on May 21 inside the Magic Lantern club, Hampden District Attorney William M. Bennett said on Friday.

"An individual, including a police officer, may use deadly force if he has a reasonable belief that he is in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury," Bennett said.

"Applying this legal standard to the credible facts, there is insufficient evidence to prove that the sergeant did not actually and reasonably believe that he was about to be attacked. ... Consequently, no criminal charges will be sought in this matter and the criminal investigation will be deemed closed."

Shuemaker, a 16-year veteran, was placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting.

Monson police welcomed the news.

"I'm confident the Hampden County district attorney's office has done a comprehensive and thorough investigation into the matter," said Chief Curtis M. McKenzie, who was with Shuemaker at the time of the shooting.

Shuemaker shot Merrill several times after Merrill wielded a barbecue fork with two five-inch long prongs, according to the investigation. He died of his wounds later at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield.

The shooting followed a car chase through Monson and Palmer that started after police said Merrill threatened a Monson police officer with a knife during a traffic stop.

A toxicology report showed Merrill was legally intoxicated and had cocaine metabolites in his system at the time of the shooting, Bennett said.

A dancer at the club at the time of the shooting said she heard Merrill say he "wasn't going down without a fight."
