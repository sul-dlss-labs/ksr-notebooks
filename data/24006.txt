A grand Jury ruled that an officer’s use of deadly force against Luis Yair Alvarez, 22, was justified.

In April 2018, Easter Sunday, Alvarez died after a deputy involved shooting took place in Cameron Park.

The shooting happened after, Esmeralda Vega, mother of Alvarez, called 911 saying her son was armed with a knife, the phone call was released to the press.

While in route, Alvarez took the phone and told the 911 operator, “I have a gun and knife don’t try to arrest me because I will get them with the gun or the knife, I think its best for you all to kill me, shoot me from far because I will do something.”

“Upon the deputies’ arrival they were confronted outside with Mr. Alvarez, he approached the deputy armed with a knife and kept walking towards the deputy, disobeying the deputy’s verbal commands to drop the knife. As he kept walking towards the deputy, the officer shot Alvarez,” said Omar Lucio, Cameron County Sheriff.

Ambulance was called, first aid was rendered, and the scene was secured.

In the recording of the 911 call, Vega said Alvarez may have been under the influence of some type of drug.

According to the call, Alvarez punched Vega in the face.

After that, Vega told the dispatcher Alvarez was acting crazy, yelling at the sheriff, and telling them to kill him.

At some point Vega had the phone again, and dispatcher asked if Alvarez had a pistol with him, Vega said it was a lie, and that Alvarez didn’t have a pistol.

Dispatcher then told Vega to leave, Vega said “No I don’t want them to kill him.”

Screams are heard, with Vega saying “No he’s my son.”

Shots can be heard, and Vega is left weeping.
