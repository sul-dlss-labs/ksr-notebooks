Incident at 5600 Sheraton Oaks Drive

September 9, 2005 -- A suspect was fatally shot as he assaulted a Houston police officer at 5600 Sheraton Oaks Drive about 11 p.m. on Friday (Sept. 9).

The suspect, Juan Ramon Aguilar, was struck twice and was pronounced dead at the scene.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant R. Torres and Officer S.R. Straughter reported:

A witness in the 5600 block of Sheraton Oaks Drive flagged down Officer Mark Chapnick regarding a suspicious male driving a black sports utility vehicle. The male was reportedly attempting to pick up several female juveniles. As Officer Chapnick stopped the suspect's vehicle, Juan Aguilar, exited that vehicle and refused to comply with the officer's commands. A struggle ensued as the officer attempted to handcuff Aguilar. At that point, Officer Chapnick drew and discharged his taser into Aguilar, which had little effect on him. Aguilar attacked Officer Chapnick with such force that the officer was knocked to the ground. Aguilar then tried to get the officer's service revolver while continuing to beat him about the face. Officer Chapnick drew his weapon and fired at Aguilar, striking him twice.

Officer Chapnick, assigned to the North Patrol Division, was sworn in December 2002. He was transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital with blunt force trauma to the face.

As is customary, the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney's office are investigating the incident.
