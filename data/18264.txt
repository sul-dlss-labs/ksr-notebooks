RICHLAND COUNTY, OH (WOIO) - The man shot while at a rest stop on Interstate 71 on Sunday was identified as Alexander Melchert, a first-year student at the College of Wooster.

Melchert, who is from Wisconsin, was at a rest stop in Delaware, Ohio, just after 11 a.m. on Sunday. The suspect has been identified as 25-year-old Shawn A. Johnson of Westerville.

According to Ohio State Highway Patrol, both Johnson and the victim were standing outside when Johnson fired several shots at a vehicle, striking Melchert, before Johnson jumped into his car and led troopers on a chase north on I-71.

Troopers located and pursued the shooter into Richland County, where he drove his vehicle over road spikes and crashed into a guardrail. After surrounding the vehicle, they discovered the man was dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Melchert is in critical condition at a local hospital. He was identified in an email sent by the College of Wooster dean to students.

"Please join me and the rest of the community in holding Alexander, his family and friends in your prayers," wrote the dean.

A vigil will be held at 4 p.m. in the Lowry main lounge on campus.
