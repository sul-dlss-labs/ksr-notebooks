MUNCIE, Ind. — A Muncie man took his own life after a standoff with officers at his home on the city's northwest side, city police said.

Authorities were called to the house, in the 1600 block of North Riley Road, after receiving a report of a domestic dispute early Friday, according to Deputy Police Chief Melissa Pease.

A woman, who left the house with a child and another member of her family, told officers the man was loading a rifle and "making threats to harm himself," Pease said in a release.

Police were also told a domestic battery had taken place. Officers contacted the man by phone, and then heard what was believed to be a gunshot from inside the home.

Communication continued with the man, who indicated he had loaded his gun and did not intend to come outside.

A second shot was heard, and "communication was lost and reestablished," Pease said.

The man — whose name was not released — reportedly threatened to shoot officers or to commit "suicide by cop," the release said.

After a report of a possible third gunshot, efforts continued to reestablish contact with the man.

When members of the Muncie Police Department SWAT team entered the house, they found the man "deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound," the deputy police chief said.

The incident lasted more than six hours.
