A man shot and killed by Brooklyn Park police Tuesday night had been threatening his live-in girlfriend, who had locked herself in the bathroom with a phone and was calling for help, police said Wednesday.

Citing an ongoing investigation, authorities declined to discuss exactly what happened before Eric Kirk Kolski, 45, was shot twice by two officers shortly before 7 p.m. at his home in the 10600 block of Winnetka Avenue N. They said, however, that the incident was not the first domestic disturbance at the remote home on Brooklyn Park's northern edge.

Charles Cudd Jr., who has been with the force for three years, and Chad Glirbas, a 16-year veteran of the force, were placed on paid administrative leave, standard procedure after an officer-involved shooting, said Capt. Greg Roehl.

The incident will be investigated by the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office. The Police Department will conduct an internal investigation.

Police Chief Michael Davis said the two officers were called to the house at 6:50 p.m. Tuesday on a report of a domestic dispute with weapons. They found that Kolski's girlfriend of several years, Pamela Kukowski, had locked herself in the bathroom. She called police a second time to say that he was trying to get in with a weapon.

Roehl said several officers went to the house and negotiated with Kolski for more than 20 minutes before six officers forced their way into the home. After an encounter with Kolski, Cudd and Glirbas fired two shots, killing Kolski. Roehl declined to release details of what led to the shooting of Kolski and would not say whether he threatened, charged or pointed his weapon at officers. A shotgun was recovered from the scene.

Kukowski was not hurt.

The couple has owned the home since 1988. In that time, Kolski had been arrested three times for domestic assault. The most recent case had a pending court date next month.
