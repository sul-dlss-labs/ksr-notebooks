Vancouver police announced Tuesday that the man fatally shot by police on Jan. 18 was driving a stolen vehicle and was armed with a stolen handgun.

Jesse John France, 29, was shot by officers of the U.S. Marshals Fugitive Task Force in the Addison Apartments parking lot, 7531 N.E. 18th St.

Law enforcement was searching for France, who was an ex-convict wanted for failing to check in with his community corrections officer. He was also a suspect in a suspect in several ongoing felony cases.

In the apartment complex parking lot, France rammed an unmarked police vehicle, then escalated the situation before officers shot him, according to Vancouver police. France was pronounced dead at the scene.

Kim Kapp, spokeswoman for the Vancouver Police Department, has declined to say how the situation escalated to the point where officers used deadly force.

The Regional Major Crimes Team, a multi-agency team led by the Clark County Sheriff’s Office, continues to investigate the officer-involved shooting. Anyone with additional information on this case is asked to contact the Clark County Sheriff’s Office.
