A man crashed his motorcycle in Comanche County late Saturday night after leading police officers on a high-speed pursuit. Authorities say a passenger on the motorcycle was killed, and the motorcyclist was seriously injured.

It happened at 11:17 p.m. on U.S. 277, just south of Baseline Road in Comanche County.

According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Geronimo police officers began chasing a 2004 Suzuki motorcycle, after they say the motorcycle was traveling at a high rate of speed. At one point, officers lost sight of the motorcycle as its speeds exceeded 100 miles per hour, police said.



The motorcycle, driven by 21-year-old Wolf Andrew Manuel, of Lawton, eventually ran off the roadway to the right on US 277.

Both Manuel and his passenger, 18-year-old Zachary Lynn Richardson of Waurika, Oklahoma, were on the ground. Richardson was pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities say they did smell an odor of alcoholic beverage on Manuel. Troopers listed the cause of the crash as "unsafe speed-exceeding legal limit" in the OHP collision report.
