NEW LONDON, Iowa (AP) -- A southeast Iowa man was shot to death by a Des Moines County deputy who said the man lunged at him with a knife.

Larry Wayne Peterson, 59, was shot twice in the chest Friday afternoon by Deputy Lucky Burrell, said Sheriff Mike Johnstone.

Burrell responded to Peterson's rural New London home when Peterson's family members called for help, Johnstone said.

Family members were attempting to take two cars away from Peterson and were preparing to take him for a mental evaluation, the sheriff said.

Peterson has been arrested twice by Burlington police for alleged sexual misconduct and was under investigation for a recent Henry County case, Johnstone said.

Burrell went into the house to talk with Peterson and fired the shots when Peterson pulled a 9-inch kitchen knife out of a drawer and lunged at him.

``He made several steps toward him, lunged at him with the knife and the deputy responded by using his firearm,'' Johnstone said.

Peterson's relatives were in an attached garage when the shooting occurred.

Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agents are looking into the shooting, Johnstone said.

Burrell has 30 years of experience with the sheriff's department.

New London is about 13 miles northwest of Burlington.
