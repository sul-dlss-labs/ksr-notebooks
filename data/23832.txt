An agent with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations shot and killed a known suspect in the parking lot of a Whataburger in Scottsdale on Friday morning, police said.

Sgt. Ben Hoster, a Scottsdale police spokesman, said the suspect, whose name was not released, had been waiting in the parking lot for someone who was inside the restaurant when the agent approached him at about 9:30 a.m.

"As a special agent approached the male suspect, the male suspect produced a handgun, and the agent drew his service weapon and shot and killed the male suspect," Hoster said.

Hoster said he didn't know how long HSI had been looking for the suspect but that multiple agents were in the area Friday morning in search for him. He said the Scottsdale Police Department had not been made aware of the operation before the shooting occurred.

An ICE officials did not release further details about why special agents were searching for the man, or for how long, citing the ongoing investigation.

The agency referred questions to Scottsdale police as the lead agency investigating the shooting. However, the federal agency's disciplinary office is reviewing the incident, ICE said.

Police tape cordoned off the parking lot off Shea Boulevard and 90th Street.

Eight people have been shot dead by law enforcement in Maricopa County in 2018. Of the 13 police-involved shootings, five were not fatal.
