TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WTXL)-- Half a dozen officers with the Tallahassee Police Department are on paid administrative leave after two suspects are shot, one of them dead.

Police say Monday's shooting started with an armed robbery on Gamble and Mills Streets. Officers say they first chased two suspects in cars, but when the suspects' car crashed into a tree, they ran away. Police say an officer shot Arthur James in the area of Copeland and Call Street in front of the Fine Arts building on Florida State University's campus. James was taken to the hospital to be treated for his injuries and was taken into custody.

A second suspect, Tommy Jackson, continued running across Tennessee Street toward the area near Virginia and Carolina Streets. Jackson then began shooting back at police. He was shot and later died from his injuries.

"We currently have six officers that have been placed on administrative leave, pending the outcome of the investigation," said Officer Scott Beck with the Tallahassee Police Department. "That doesn't mean that all six used any type of force or discharged their firearm, that is just standard procedure for any officer that was there and involved in that incident to be placed on paid administrative leave."

The six officers are:

Ofc. Doug Clark

Ofc. Steven Britt

Ofc. Derek Kidd

Ofc. Ray Garcia

Ofc. Brian Perry

Ofc. Matthew Wagner

The TPD Violent Crimes Unit is working with the Office of the Medical Examiner and State Attorney's office in their ongoing investigation. The case will be presented to a grand jury for review. Investigators are looking for witnesses and asking anyone who observed the incident to call 850-606-5800.
