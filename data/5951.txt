Day-long Robbery Spree Ends March 7, 2007

Los Angeles: Detectives identified 25-year-old Antonio Leontra Bland as the man police shot after he pointed a gun at officers during a foot pursuit in Jefferson Park Sunday night, March 4, 2007. Bland later died at a local hospital.

The confrontation occurred just after 5 PM when two police officers from the Southwest Police Station responded to a witness’ report that a robber had just left the mini-market located at 3781 South Western Avenue. As the officers arrived at Exposition Boulevard and Gramercy Place, another person pointed out Bland, who ran from police.

Officer John Davis, 26, and his partner chased Bland about 100 feet when Bland removed a gun from his waistband and pointed it at the officers. Officer Davis fired twice, striking Bland in the head. Bland was pronounced dead at California Hospital at 6:15 PM.

Police recovered Bland’s .38 caliber handgun at the scene. Neither officer was injured in the incident.

Bland was suspected in committing at least three other robberies that same day. The first robbery attributed to him occurred at 7AM Sunday morning, at the Burger King at Martin Luther King Boulevard and Western Avenue. He held up the employees at gunpoint as they opened the restaurant.

He was also suspected in the robbery of a small discount store at 3991 South Western Avenue around 3 PM. He stole cash and cell phones from that business.

Bland was a resident of South Los Angeles. He was a documented gang member with five prior felony convictions for narcotics, robbery, and burglary.
