TRENTON, N.D. -- Authorities have identified a man who died in a weekend crash in northwestern North Dakota while allegedly fleeing from law officers.



The Highway Patrol says 46-year-old Gary Yarbrough of Roseburg died Saturday night when the pickup truck he was driving went out of control on state Highway 1804 in Williams County, overturned onto its roof and slid into a semitrailer.



Authorities allege that Yarbrough had been harassing workers in a construction zone and fled when a county deputy tried to stop him. A Bureau of Indian Affairs officer later joined the chase.



Yarbrough died at the scene of the crash about 7 1/2 miles west of Trenton. The driver of the semitrailer was not hurt.
