Chicago police shot and killed a man at an "L" station Sunday night when they said he pointed two pistols at officers.

A spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police said it appeared the gunman may have committed "suicide by cop."

The man was identified Monday by the Cook County medical examiner's office as Frank Steponaitis, 55, of the 2000 block of South Blue Island Avenue.

The incident began with officers responding to calls of a man with a gun at the Western/Cermak Pink Line station in the 2000 block of South Western Avenue about 8 p.m., according to police and FOP spokesman Pat Camden.

When officers from the Monroe District arrived, they found Steponaitis holding a gun to his own head, Camden said. The officers tried calming him and getting him to drop the weapon and end the standoff. But Steponaitis then pulled a second handgun and pointed both at officers, Camden said.

The officers, put in a "defensive posture," fired their weapons, striking Steponaitis. He was later pronounced dead, Camden said.

No officers were injured during the incident.

The shooting is being investigated by the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates all police-involved shootings.
