MIDLAND, TX (KCBD) - A man is dead and a sheriff’s deputy is on leave following a shooting Tuesday afternoon near Midland.

The Midland County Sheriff’s Office says the Texas Rangers are handling the investigation into the incident that left 33-year-old Jerald Wilson dead.

The incident started just after 12:30 p.m. when deputies were called to railroad tracks near the Interstate 20 Business Loop just east of Midland.

Various 911 callers reported seeing a man walking along the highway and attempting to walk onto the tracks.

When deputies arrived, they noticed Wilson appeared to be cutting himself.

According to the sheriff, a deputy tried to use his taser on Wilson twice to make him stop, but was unsuccessful. The sheriff says Wilson then lunged at the deputy with the item he had been cutting himself with, a broken bottle.

The deputy fired two rounds and Wilson fell onto the tracks.

The deputy then pulled Wilson off the tracks because a eastbound train was headed toward them, but that is when they learned Wilson was dead.

The deputy was placed on paid administrative leave while the Texas Rangers conduct their investigation. The deputy is also being given the opportunity to talk to a counselor.
