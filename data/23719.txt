A man who barricaded himself inside a Gwinnett County home Monday was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after an hours-long SWAT standoff, police said.

SWAT Activation update: The suspect has been found deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Thank you to the neighbors and local community for your patience. — Gwinnett Police Dept (@GwinnettPd) February 5, 2018

﻿Authorities were at the Laurel View Drive home in unincorporated Snellville to serve James Burley Jr., 33, an arrest warrant, but he refused to come out, Gwinnett police Cpl. Michele Pihera said.

The neighborhood was blocked off as SWAT officers negotiated with Burley.

Pihera said they had hoped for “a peaceful resolution,” but SWAT members found Burley dead from a gunshot wound just after 6 p.m.

Police had been at the home since 9 a.m.

It was the second SWAT situation of the day in metro Atlanta.

A team had a DeKalb County home surrounded for nearly four hours after a gunman barricaded himself inside. Just before 12:30 p.m., footage showed the teen being led away from a home in the 3900 block of Appleton Court in handcuffs.
