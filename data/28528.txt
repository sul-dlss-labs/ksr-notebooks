A 31-year-old Belmont man was killed and two others were seriously injured in a one-crash Sunday morning in Webster, after the driver had sped away from police as they tried to issue an outstanding violation.

Adam Liesner, who was sitting in the back seat of a 2005 Chevy Blazer, was declared dead at the scene. The driver, 39-year-old Elizabeth Fraser of Concord, suffered “serious bodily injuries,” according to the State Police, and was taken to Concord Hospital.

Twenty-eight year-old Caitlyn Cote of Boscawen was sitting in the front seat and also sustained serious injuries. She was taken to Concord Hospital as well.

The State Police said that a Webster police officer driving southbound on Concord Street passed a car with a motor vehicle violation. The officer turned his cruiser around, at which time the Chevy sped away, the State Police said.

“As the officer crested the hill,” a statement read, “he observed that the same vehicle had failed to negotiate a curve in the road, left the roadway and struck a tree.”

The Webster Police Department requested help from the New Hampshire State Police Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Unit.

The Boscawen Police Department also responded, as did the Webster Fire/EMS Department. Concord Drive was closed for several hours.

All aspects of the crash are being investigated. The State Police said speed appeared to be a factor.
