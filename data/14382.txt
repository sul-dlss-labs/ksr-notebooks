DETROIT â€“ Maggie Miller is grieving after her son and two of his teenage friends were killed in a crash on Easter Sunday.

"We'll live, but it's going to be tough," the mother told Local 4. "My son was a good boy."

Police said 17-year-old Charles Miller, 16-year-old Suhali Alvarez and 14-year-old Cynthia Eli-Zaraharas left a house party Saturday night and got into a stolen Jeep Cherokee.

Police said when officers ran the SUV's plate and found out it was stolen, they tried to pull it over. But, police said, the SUV sped off, hitting 100 miles per hour before crashing through an Interstate 75 service drive fence and landing on top of another car near Clark Street.

While Miller said her son was behind the wheel and made a bad choice, it shouldn't have cost them their lives.

"Now we have three families who have to say goodbye to three loved ones, all for a little joy ride," Maggie Miller said. "But they were not violent, they weren't hurting nobody, and they definitely didn't deserve any of this."
