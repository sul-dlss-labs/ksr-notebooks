WINDOM -- The Cottonwood County Sheriff’s Office on Wednesday released the names of the individuals involved in the shooting incident Monday in Windom.

Todd Steven Herreid, 48, of Windom, was the deceased male located inside the home at 764 Third Ave. Jill Charlene Herreid, 52, of Windom, is the injured female who was transported to Windom Area Hospital for treatment of undisclosed injuries.

A report of a disturbance at the residence was received at 8:24 a.m. Monday by the Cottonwood County Sheriff’s Office. When officers arrived at the house, they first heard shouting and then shots fired from within the residence.

After taking cover behind their squad cars and piles of snow, officers reported that two rounds struck a squad car parked on the street.

The standoff lasted more than four hours, with barricades set up to prevent people from driving by and calls for assistance sent out to other area law enforcement agencies. Blizzard conditions hampered travel and complicated the situation.
