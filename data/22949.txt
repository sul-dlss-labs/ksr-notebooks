A man who climbed a huge crane at the Port of Los Angeles after he jumped from a stolen SUV at the end of a lengthy police chase fell to his death late Wednesday.

After an hours-long standoff, TV news reports showed the man had fallen to his death about 9:20 p.m.

Earlier, the man had removed all of his clothing while perched atop crane 87, which skies more than 100 feet high inside the West Basin Shipping Terminal. The port terminal was evacuated and shut down shortly after the man drove through a security gate at the entrance to the terminal, said Port of Los Angeles spokesman Phillip Sanfield.

The vehicle was first spotted by LAPD officers in the Wilshire Division. The chase came through Torrance on Hawthorne Boulevard; Torrance police spotted him at 238th Street and gave chase south over the Palos Verdes Peninsula at high speed toward the ocean.

Torrance police called off the chase due to dangerous conditions. Long Beach police picked him up in their city and the chase moved through the city, returning through Wilmington into San Pedro and ultimately into the Port of Los Angeles complex.

The man, wearing a Kobe Bryant No. 8 Jersey, was seen on television driving up and down the cargo terminal as dockworkers looked on.

He then got out of the SUV – it was seen rolling away – and began climbing a large crane, at one point passing two workers on the way up. Sanfield said the man is sitting on a crane that is 120 feet above the water.

The SUV was reported stolen from a San Bernardino dealership Wednesday morning.

“It was stolen from Mitsubishi of San Bernardino this morning around 10:30,” San Bernardino Police Lt. Mike Madden said. “It is a new car. The suspect somehow got the key and just drove off in the car.”

Madden said police don’t believe any force was used when the vehicle was taken.

“We were never in pursuit of it,” he said. “It had a tracking device alerting authorities to it’s whereabouts.”
