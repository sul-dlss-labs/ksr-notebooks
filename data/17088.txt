A driver who crashed into a block wall in Glendale on Monday morning died after being pulled from the wreckage, police said.

Officers saw two drivers run a red light at 71st and Glendale avenues, followed them and came across the single-vehicle crash about 6:30 a.m., said Sgt. David Vidaure, a police spokesman.

Police have identified the driver as 50-year-old Arnulfo Gallegos.

Fire crews extricated the Gallegos, Vidaure said, but he was later pronounced dead at a hospital.

The other driver told police that the crashed car struck his vehicle near 75th Avenue and fled before slamming into the block wall, Vidaure said.

The crash closed 71st Avenue from Orangewood Avenue to Myrtle Avenue while police investigated.
