A Chicago police officer shot and killed a 35-year-old South Side man Tuesday night after another policeman's gun was grabbed during a scuffle in the 6000 block of South Eberhart Avenue, a department spokesman said.

Marcus Bell, of the 5700 block of South Calumet Avenue, was shot in the chest after allegedly fighting with two Grand Crossing patrolmen on a landing outside a two-flat building, police said.

He was pronounced dead by the Cook County medical examiner at 2:15 a.m. Wednesday.

According to Chicago Police Department spokesman Pat Camden, Bell caused a traffic accident a block away while driving a stolen car.

Bell refused to surrender to police and began fighting with the officers as they tried to place him under arrest, Camden said.

Knocking one of the patrolmen down the stairs, Bell wrestled the other officer's weapon away from him, Camden said. The disarmed policeman called out to his partner that Bell was armed and the partner shot Bell in the chest.

Bell was the third man killed by police in seven shootings since March 7.

He was the second man slain after allegedly trying to disarm a police officer.

Michael Pleasance, 23, of Justice, was shot in the neck and killed after a struggle with a police officer on the CTA Red Line platform at 95th Street and the Dan Ryan Expressway.

Richard Specker, 47, of the 1400 block of West Erie Street, was shot and killed after wounding a police officer during a shootout inside a Northwest Side restaurant, police said.

Four other men have been wounded after they allegedly waved guns or shot at police.

Department reviews of each shooting, including Tuesday's, have cleared the officers of wrongdoing.
