PHOENIX (AP) — A man darting back and forth across a busy freeway was shot and killed by deputies Saturday after getting into a physical struggle with one of them, authorities said.

Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Bob Ticer said a deputy responded to Interstate 17 near New River on Saturday after reports that a man was running across the freeway.

At some point, the suspect picked up rocks and the deputy called for backup, Ticer said.

The second officer arrived and a Taser stun gun was used. But somehow that didn't stop the man, who assaulted one of the officers trying to arrest him, Ticer said.

That officer sustained injuries to the face, he said.

A second officer shot the suspect after the first officer was thrown to the ground, Ticer said.

Neither the man, nor the two officers involved had been identified Saturday.

DPS had a helicopter hovering overhead and flew the suspect to a nearby hospital, where he died within an hour, Ticer said.

Both officers were placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation, which is standard in police shootings.
