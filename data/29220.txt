AMBERG - A Marinette County sheriff's deputy shot and killed an armed man who left the scene of a domestic incident Friday in Amberg, according to the Wisconsin Department of Justice.

Sheriff's deputies responded around 11 a.m. Friday to a home in Amberg for a report of a domestic incident, DOJ said in a news release. A man was sitting in a vehicle outside the home when deputies arrived. Deputies attempted to speak with the man, but he drove away.

Deputies followed the man and after a short distance, the man got out of his vehicle and brandished a gun, according to DOJ. A deputy shot the man.

Police tried to save the man's life and he was taken to a hospital where he died from his injuries, according to DOJ.

The officer involved is on administrative assignment, per department policy, and the DOJ is investigating the shooting. The state will turn over its findings to the Marinette County District Attorney's Office.

The investigation is ongoing and more information will be released "when it becomes available," according to the DOJ.

This is the second police shooting in the county in about a month. On Oct. 24, sheriff's deputies shot and killed a man who fled from the scene of a homicide in Goodman, according to DOJ.

Officials say the man in that case, John Lipski, fled from police in his car, then stopped, got out of the vehicle and pointed a gun at police, who fired at him. Authorities say Lipski shot and killed Richard Gibbs before he was killed by police.

Goodman is about 27 miles away from Amberg.

Officers were cleared in that shooting earlier this month.
