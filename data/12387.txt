Jennifer Lynne Pearson was a kind and determined woman who loved to cook and garden but who saw good in a man “you shouldn’t have in your life,” her twin sister, Kathleen Jenkins, said Wednesday.

On Monday, firefighters found Pearson dead in her burned-out Reston apartment, the victim of an apparent homicide, with a knife in her body and a possible gunshot wound. Pearson, 38, was pregnant when she died.

Her husband, Timothy Connor, 31, killed himself Tuesday in Bandera County, Tex., after authorities there were asked by Fairfax County police to be on the lookout for his car.

Deputies followed Connor to his mother’s driveway in Bandera County, where he got out of the car and shot himself in the head, said Matthew King of the sheriff’s department. Connor died at a San Antonio hospital, King said.

According to Bandera County Chief Deputy Matt King, Connor pulled into his parents’ driveway at 11:31 a.m. on Tuesday, Feb. 19, after being signaled by a Bandera County patrol car. Deputies were attempting to pull him over in response to an alert from the Fairfax County Police Department. King said investigators there were interested in talking to Connor regarding the death of his wife Jennifer Lynn Pearson, 38. Pearson was found dead after a fire was extinguished in the couple’s Reston apartment on Feb. 18.

“It was just a matter of minutes from when they stopped him to when he shot himself,” King said of Connor, adding deputies tried to convince him to put his gun down.

Connor’s father, Richard Rector, said deputies told him Connor spoke his final words in the driveway, moments after arriving.
