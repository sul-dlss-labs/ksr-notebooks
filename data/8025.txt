Rockwell City man dies in motorcycle crash

A 22-year-old Rockwell City man died over the weekend after a crash near Lohrville in Calhoun County. The Iowa State Patrol identified the victim as Adam John Williams.

Reportedly Williams was operating a 2005 Kawasaki motorcycle on Highway 175 heading eastbound at an apparent high rate of speed after being clocked by a Calhoun County Sheriff’s Deputy.

When the Deputy initiated a traffic stop Williams made a west turn on 175 striking the rear side of a westbound pickup truck driven by 54-year-old Daniel Wallace of Fonda. Williams was thrown from the motorcycle and was pronounced dead at the scene.

Wallace escaped injury. The accident remains under investigation by the State Patrol and the Calhoun County Sheriff’s Department.
