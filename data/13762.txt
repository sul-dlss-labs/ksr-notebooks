Three Live Oak residents were killed and a fourth seriously injured early Thursday after their car crashed on U.S. 129 as they were fleeing police, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Driver Lonnie Lavern Freeman, 20, and 16-year-old passenger Patrelle J. Strokes were pronounced dead on the scene. Another passenger, 20-year-old Shiateria Wimbash, was flown by air ambulance to UF Health in Gainesville, but died early Friday, according to the Highway Patrol. Kwon Lavell Matthews, 23, was listed in serious condition at the same hospital.

The incident began just after midnight when the Suwannee County Sheriff's Office was called to the McDonald's restaurant at US 129 and Interstate 10 on a disturbance, the Highway Patrol said. As deputies arrived, a 2002 Chevrolet Monte Carlo drove off after hitting another car in the parking lot. The Chevrolet kept going down U.S. 129 with Suwannee County deputies in pursuit, then tried to turn right, the Highway Patrol said.

The driver lost control and spun into a business at 815 Ohio Ave. Paramedics declared two inside dead at the scene. Wimbash died about 1 a.m., the Highway Patrol said.
