A Dauphin County man died Sunday after a state police trooper shot him during a confrontation following an argument in a home, according to police.

Police were called at 5:11 p.m. when the man identified as Glenn William Custer, 59, was at the home in the 100 block of Gilberg Lane in West Hanover Township.

When troopers arrived, they found Custer was “erratic” and armed with a knife, police said. Custer refused commands to drop the knife and instead began moving toward multiple occupied residences.

Police said Custer was still refusing to drop the knife when he walked back toward the home the incident began in and toward a trooper, who discharged his firearm, hitting Custer. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Following the shooting, more than a dozen police vehicles could be seen in the parking lot of the Full Gospel Mission Church, which is where Gilberg Lane intersects with Route 443. State police officers had closed Gilberg Lane, and additional vehicles including the Forensics Unit were at a home down the road.

Although a house was across the street from the road, very few other residences could be seen through the heavily forested area.

State Police spokeswoman Trooper Megan Ammerman said it is department policy that any time a trooper is involved in a deadly-force situation that they are placed on paid leave pending the investigation.

Ammerman said the investigation is ongoing.
