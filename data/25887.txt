A Denver police officer will not face criminal charges in the April shooting of a 17-year-old who ultimately took his own life.

Anthony Solano Vasquez, 17, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a car chase and shootout with Denver police officers. The officers had shot Vasquez in the shoulder, but he died by suicide, Denver District Attorney Beth McCann wrote in a decision letter about the shooting.

The officer who shot Vasquez was authorized to use deadly physical force because he was attempting to prevent Vasquez from escaping arrest and because he believed Vasquez was a threat to public safety, McCann wrote in the letter to police Chief Paul Pazen.

On April 10, an armed carjacking of an SUV by three teen boys was reported in Aurora near 16th Avenue and Nome Street. Patrol officers arrived around 12:50 a.m. and saw the stolen SUV at Colfax Avenue and Syracuse Street and began to pursue it.

The SUV crashed near 16th Avenue and Quebec Street. The suspects ran away with officers in pursuit. Vasquez shot his gun at the officers, and the officers returned fire, McCannâ€™s letter said.

As officers were searching for the suspects, they heard a single gunshot in the vicinity of Quebec Street. They found Vasquez in a window well on the 1500 block of Quebec Street suffering from a gunshot wound to the head, the letter said. Vasquez was taken to Denver Health Medical Center and died on April 11.

An autopsy from the Denver Medical Examiner determined that Vasquez had sustained a gunshot wound to his left shoulder blade from one of the officers, as well as a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The medical examiner ruled that his death was a suicide.
