— Agents with the State Bureau of Investigation seized a knife and an air pistol, as well as prescription medications, from the home of a man killed last week by Wake County sheriff's deputies, according to a search warrant returned Tuesday.





Deputies were responding to reports of loud music at the home of Michael Harrison Andrews, 21, when the shooting occurred early in the morning on April 8.







Andrews had become belligerent, told deputies he was armed and that they needed to leave his residence, the warrant stated. At one point, he told deputies he wanted to end his life.







The warrant also stated that a special response team talked with him for more than an hour, during which Andrews walked around in front of his home with a gun, refusing to put it down.







"The victim was repeatedly seen with a handgun and continued to move in and out of the front door of his residence," investigators said.







Deputies Scott Earp and Jeffrey Minschew shot Andrews after he raised his gun toward deputies, according to the warrant.







Wake County Sheriff Donnie Harrison has declined to comment on the shooting. The SBI is investigating, which is standard in officer-involved shootings.







Earp and Minschew are on administrative duty, pending the completion of the SBI investigation.
