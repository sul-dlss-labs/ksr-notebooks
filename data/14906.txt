Police still aren't sure why a 20-year-old man attacked his aunt and the woman's baby last week in Folsom, but they do know a bit more about what led to the deadly infant stabbing, officers said Wednesday.The situation began around 2:30 p.m. Thursday, when police were called to a home in the 300 block of Montrose Drive, according to a news release from the Folsom Police Department.When the first officer arrived to investigate the apparent stabbing, he was greeted by 20-year-old Jose M. Reyes-Torres.The Folsom man was covered in blood, but advanced on the officer, police said.Reyes-Torres had just stabbed his aunt -- whose name still hasn't been released -- and the woman's son, 6-month-old Roberto Varela.Roberto was Reyes-Torres' cousin.The officer fired one shot, which hit Reyes-Torres, but he continued to fight police even after he was taken into custody.Investigators called for medical help and had Reyes-Torres taken to a nearby hospital.Baby Roberto and the infant's mother were transported to hospitals, as well.Within the next few hours, Roberto and Reyes-Torres were both pronounced dead, police said.The baby's mother remains hospitalized after having surgery. She's listed as stable.Reyes-Torres went to his aunt's home armed with two knives, and within a minute of his arrival, he attacked her and Roberto, officers said.He stabbed his aunt repeatedly with one of the knives, then pushed past another relative before stabbing the baby repeatedly, according to the release.When police arrived and found Reyes-Torres, he was in the process of searching for other family members, officers said.The first responding officer told Reyes-Torres to stop, but he charged at the cop, yelling profanities, police said.-----Read last week's report: Suspect identified in stabbing of baby, woman in Folsom
