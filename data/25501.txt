RED BLUFF — A 45-year-old Red Bluff man was shot and killed Monday morning by a Tehama County Sheriff’s deputy near the Jellys Ferry Bridge after the man, armed with a knife, charged another deputy.

A press release issued Monday morning by the Tehama County Sheriff’s Department said deputies responded to a domestic violence call at around 5:30 a.m. Monday in the area of Jellys Ferry Bridge.

The victim, a 40-year-old woman, was riding in a vehicle driven by her ex-husband on Jellys Ferry Road when he threatened to crash the vehicle in order to kill both of them, the release said.

Carl Thayer drove the vehicle into a fence near the bridge, the woman escaped and fled to a nearby residence where she called authorities. The man fled the vehicle and was eventually tracked down by the deputies.

Thayer confronted with a knife in his hand by three deputies who attempted to take him into custody, the release said. He refused orders to drop the knife and a deputy deployed a taser, which the man deflected using his jacket as a shield.

Keeping his jacket up, Thayer charged a deputy with the knife and another deputy shot three rounds that struck him, the release said.

CPR was performed by deputies but Thayer was pronounced dead at the scene.

“The Tehama County Sheriff’s Office has initiated the Officer Involved Shooting Protocol and the Tehama County District Attorney’s Office and the California Department of Justice will be conducting the investigation in this incident,” the release said.

No further information was released.
