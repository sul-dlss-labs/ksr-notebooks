WESTMINSTER – A 21-year-old man who police found dead in a 13th Street apartment after an 11-hour standoff Monday has been identified as David Long Vu, a suspected gang member from Westminster.

Special Weapons and Tactics team officers surrounded the apartment building in the 7800 block of 13th Street just before midnight Sunday night after someone inside an apartment fired several shots at officers who were trying to break up a street fight.

Officers did not shoot back, Westminster police officer Rachel Archambault said. Nearby residents were evacuated and SWAT officers spent hours trying to get the gunman to surrender, tossing in tear gas canisters into the apartment and sending in a robot to survey the situation. SWAT members went into the apartment about 10:30 a.m. Monday and found Vu with a single gunshot wound to the chest, Detective Cameron Knauerhaze said. A gun lay nearby.

Neighbors said they were awakened by screams and yells about 11:40 p.m. Sunday and looked outside to see more than a dozen men fighting in the middle of Pacific Avenue. Police said the scuffle began at the nearby Green Girl Saloon, a bikini bar on Beach Boulevard, and carried out into the street. The fight may have been gang-related, Knauerhaze said.

One of the beating victims called 911 during the fight and police showed up to break up the brawl. Three to four shots rang out as officers raced up the stairs of the apartment building after several of the people believed to have been fighting.

An autopsy was conducted on Vu’s body this morning. His death is being investigated as a suicide.

Three other Westminster men are being held on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon during the melee and being members of a gang. Four other men were cited and released, but additional arrests could be made as detectives continue their investigation, Knauerhaze said.
