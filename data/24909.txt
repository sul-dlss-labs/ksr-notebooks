New video of an incident involving a now-former police officer, accused of driving drunk and and hitting a man on a bike in a fatal incident back in September, have been released.

The former officer, who is being held on a murder charge, also collided with a Glendale Police car.

The officer, Kevin Hevel, was fired a week after the incident, and remains behind bars

The new video shows the scene back in September, when Peter Rankin, 60, was hit and killed just after midnight by an alleged drunk driver, near Glendale and 75th Avenues. According to police, the driver was Hevel, 30.

"People just don't deserve to die like that," said Rankin's brother, Ron, back in September.

Hevel then reportedly continued to drive after hitting Rankin, and the new video shows a collision, where Hevel's red SUV slams into a Glendale Police vehicle.

Police say Hevel's blood alcohol level at the time was 3 times over the legal limit.

When Hevel was arrested, Navajo Nation police chief Phillip Francisco said, in part:

Hevel's trial is set to start in May.
