Deputies attempting to pull over a motorcyclist in Yucca Valley on Monday engaged in a high-speed chase and shootout, with one deputy fatally shot and the motorcyclist killed in the gunfight.

Late Monday, San Bernardino County Sheriff John McMahon said in a video posted on Twitter that Sgt. Dominic Vaca, 43, a 17-year veteran with the department, had died at a hospital of his injuries. He was assigned to the Morongo Basin Station.

“The gunshot wound he sustained earlier today was too severe for him to overcome. Our prayers are with him and his family as we all mourn this difficult time,” McMahon said, noting hospital staff had performed heroic life-saving measures.

McMahon said earlier Monday that deputies were doing extra patrol for off-highway vehicle violations when they spotted the motorcyclist near Paxton Road and Imperial Drive about 2 p.m. and attempted to pull him over because there was no license plate on the motorcycle. The desert area is north of Highway 62 and west of Joshua Tree and Twentynine Palms.

The rider fled on the motorcycle, leading deputies on a pursuit that ended near Dumosa Avenue and Sunnyslope Drive, where they found the motorcycle abandoned. The deputies approached the motorcycle, not realizing they were walking into an ambush.

“The (motorcycle) rider started firing at the responding deputies. One of our deputies was struck by the gunfire,” McMahon said.

Deputies returned fire and killed the suspect. A handgun was retrieved from the scene, McMahon said.

The wounded deputy, later identified as Vaca, was subsequently flown to a hospital, where he initially was reported to be in serious condition.

The Sheriff’s Department did not immediately release the name of the suspect who died.
