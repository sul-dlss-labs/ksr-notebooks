Jaime Flores, 29, a Latino man, was shot six times by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies in the 10727 block of Inglewood Avenue in the Lennox area and died at 8:02 p.m. Monday, April 2.

The Sheriff's Department issued a statement saying Flores stepped out from behind a parked car as deputies pulled up at about 7:18 p.m. Flores was holding what looked like a silver pistol. Deputies got out and ordered him to drop it, but instead he pointed it at them, they said. One deputy fired, striking him; he was transported to Harbor-UCLA, where he died.
