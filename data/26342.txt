VIDALIA, La. (KNOE) – The wife of a deputy shot in the line of duty in Vidalia on July 25, 2019, has released more details on his condition.

According to a public post on Facebook, Pamala Michelle Mackel says her husband, Walter Mackel, was hit by the bullet in his left lung and kidney. She posted, “Yes, Walter was in surgery everything went well, his left lung and kidney were hit. He has a tube in his chest and stomach to help keep air and blood drained. They did not remove bullet because it would’ve caused more damage. We’ll be in the hospital for the next few days. Continue to keep us in your prayers.”
