Bristol District Attorney Thomas Quinn Friday released a 21-page investigative report finding that the fatal shooting of Larry Ruiz-Barreto by a Fall River police officer was "justified."

The Fall River Herald News reported that Ruiz-Barreto died after he was shot by Officer Nicholas Hoar the night of Nov. 12, 2017.

Quinn's report said Ruiz-Barreto was shot after he drove his car at the officer. Hoar was unable to avoid the oncoming vehicle and was pushed onto the car's hood. The report continued that Ruiz-Barreto continued to drive with Hoar on the front of the car, pointing his gun Ruiz-Barreto and ordering him to stop.

Quinn said Ruiz-Barreto refused to pull over and Hoar fired six rounds through the windshield, hitting Ruiz-Barreto five times. The suspect was hit in the arms, chest and abdomen. He was transported to Charlton Memorial Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The report said Ruiz-Barreto's father was in the backseat of the car at the time of the shooting.

Quinn's report said Ruiz-Barreto "intentionally and unlawfully" tried to injure or kill Hoar.

"The circumstances show that Mr. Ruiz-Barreto needlessly and repeatedly escalated the danger to the police officer by refusing to submit to a lawful stop," the newspaper quoted the report.
