McMINNVILLE, Ore. (KOIN) — Two Yamhill County deputies who shot a man to death following a break-in at an Amity home were cleared after an investigation, the Yamhill County District Attorney said Friday.

Kelly Sutton was shot minutes after a 911 call on June 7 around 5:24 a.m. by a resident who said a person they didn’t know was inside their house. The caller said they believed the intruder was high or drunk

The Yamhill County DA’s office said the dramatic 911 calls explain the events that lead up to the shooting and helped clear the deputies of wrongdoing.

In the recordings, Sgt. Sam Elliot and Deputy Stephanie Saulk can be heard struggling with Sutton, who they said was choking one of them.

Seven minutes later, officials said, Sutton was spotted on Rice Lane near Jellison Avenue.

A minute later, shots were fired, Yamhill County deputies said, though officials didn’t disclose at the time how many shots were fired and who they came from.

The DA said the officers shot and killed Sutton because he grabbed Elliot’s legs ands tarted strangling him. The DA said Elliot shot Sutton, who backed off briefly and then charged again. Elliot and Saulk both fired, killing Sutton.

Paramedics were called after the shooting, but Sutton died at the scene.
