SEGUIN, Texas (AP) â€” A Central Texas police officer who fatally shot a robbery suspect will not face charges.

The Seguin Gazette reported Sunday that a Guadalupe County grand jury declined to indict Seguin Officer Mike Guerra.

Police on April 26 responded to a convenience store robbery by a person wearing a ski mask, a motorcycle helmet and carrying a shotgun. A suspect was seen putting the shotgun in his backpack while leaving.

Officials say Darrel S. Machemehl of Seguin fled on a motorcycle, then stopped and threatened officers.

Investigators say officers told Machemehl, more than 40 times, to drop his backpack. He refused and was shot when he approached the officers.

Authorities say the weapon fell out during the 17-mile chase.

Machemehl was free on bond following a February DWI arrest.
