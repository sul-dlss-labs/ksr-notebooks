A standoff ended shortly before 6 p.m. on Monday after Auburn police said a man fired at officers, and that he was barricaded inside a home in Algona with three people inside.

The Algona police department responded Monday afternoon after receiving reports shortly before 1:00 p.m. of a domestic violence situation involving an armed, suicidal man and three hostages.

Responding officers learned that there was an existing no-contact order in effect between the man and at least one of the hostages.

After attempts to contact an adult female hostage, police attempted to remove the hostages from the scene, but were fired upon by the man. The officers then disengaged and called for backup.

Additional law enforcement authorities, including a behavioral health unit and a hostage negotiation team, responded to the scene.

After several hours of conversation and attempts at negotiation with the man, the negotiation team concluded that a potential remained for the man to harm the hostages. The Valley SWAT team then initiated a rescue mission to remove the hostages from the home.

All three hostages were removed from the scene safely and sustained no injuries.

Shortly after the hostages were rescued, two SWAT team members encountered the man and fired their weapons, striking the man.

Medical responders began treating the man, but he died from his injuries.

As this was an officer-involved shooting, the Independent Force Investigation Team responded to the scene and will be conducting an investigation into the incident.
