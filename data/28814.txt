TRACY (CBS13) – Four people were killed Friday night in Tracy after a driver lost control of the vehicle and crashed into a tree, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Tracy area CHP said the collision happened at around 7 p.m. when the driver attempted to re-enter Interstate 205 off of Tracy Boulevard.

Prior to the crash, CHP said it attempted a traffic stop on the vehicle on southbound Interstate 5 for a moving violation, which prompted a brief high-speed chase. The pursuit was called off after officers lost track of the vehicle.

According to the CHP, the vehicle crashed shortly later after entering I-205 and exiting the freeway on Tracy Boulevard and all four occupants – two males, two females – of the vehicle were declared dead by responding officers.

While authorities have not yet officially confirmed the identities of the four people, a family has told CBS13 that one of the victims killed in the crash was Stockton teen Treyvon Breckenridge

Trey was a leader, an entrepreneur, and a light. It was a joy to watch him grow through high school and I am deeply saddened and upset that his life was cut far too short. He had so much to give! Prayers for his family and for us all for the loss. RIP."
