Authorities are investigating the death of a Marion County man who was allegedly shot by a Bassfield police officer early this morning. Details are incomplete tonight, but Jeff Davis County Coroner Greg Blackwell says he was called to the scene of an "officer-involved shooting" shortly after one a.m. at the intersection of Highways 42 and 35 in Bassfield. Blackwell says Jason Holmes, in his late 20's from Kokomo, had a gunshot wound and later died at Prentiss Regional Hospital. Blackwell says an autopsy this afternoon confirmed Holmes died of a single gunshot to the chest. Bassfield police officials say the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting.
