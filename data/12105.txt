Just in from the State Police:

Special Agents of the Arkansas State Police Criminal Investigation Division are conducting an investigation of a law enforcement officer involved shooting in Phillips County last night (Friday, December 14th).

Darryl Vance Parker, 50, of Elaine was shot by state wildlife officers after Parker used his truck to hit Arkansas State Trooper Jason Martin.

Parker was pronounced dead at the scene.

Trooper Martin is recovering at a Memphis hospital and is reported to be in stable condition from non-life threatening injuries.

About 10:30 PM Arkansas Game and Fish wildlife officers along with Trooper Martin attempted to stop Parker along Phillips County Road 350 west of Barton. Parker was being stopped on suspicion that he had been night hunting. Parker fled from officers and drove into a wheat field where his truck began to slow as the result of thick mud across the field.

Trooper Martin moved-in on foot to approach Parker’s vehicle. Parker moved the truck and struck Trooper Martin who was knocked to the ground, but made his way back to the driver’s door in an attempt to take Parker into custody.

Parker again used the truck to hit Trooper Martin who was knocked down as wildlife officers fired their weapons on the cab of the truck striking Parker.

Upon completion of the investigation, the State Police will submit the case file to local prosecuting attorneys for review.
