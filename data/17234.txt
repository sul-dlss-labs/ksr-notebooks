KENTON, Ohio (WCMH) — One officer is in stable condition after being shot twice and a suspect is dead after shooting in Hardin County Saturday evening.

Hardin County Sheriff Keith Everhart said Kenton Police Officer Skyler Newfer is recovering after being shot twice by a suspect.

“Hopefully he gets to come home soon,” Everhart said.

Everhart said police were called out just before 5 pm for a domestic disturbance on Grove Street in Kenton. The suspect, Stephen C. Davis, 47, of Kenton, was reportedly sitting in front of a home with a gun. As officers approached, Davis fired a rifle at the officers before driving off west of Kenton.

The vehicle stopped on County Road 106, just off of State Route 309, and Davis fired several shots at the officers in pursuit. Newfer was struck twice in the back. He was the only officer struck, according to Everhart. Davis got back in his vehicle and continued heading west as police and deputies continued to chase the suspect.

Everhart said more gunfire was exchanged until the suspect’s vehicle crashed into a ditch and and a guide wire. Davis was found dead in the vehicle. It is unknown if Davis was killed by officer gunfire or a self-inflicted gunshot.

Newfer was taken by a Hardin County deputy to Hardin Memorial Hospital. He was then taken to Grant Medical Center, where he is in stable condition and is expected to recover.

Newfer is a K9 officer with the Kenton Police Department.

On Sunday, Carey Police Department officer and fellow K9 officer Sutton Flick shared an update on Newfer’s status. The officer said Newfer was in good spirits.

The case remains under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigations.
