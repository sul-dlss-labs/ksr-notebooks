Maurice Shephard, a 55-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police Friday, Aug. 26, in the 100 block of D Street in Wilmington, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The incident occurred shortly after 11 p.m. when police received a call about a "screaming man."

Officers arriving at the scene found Shephard armed with a "sharp cane" inside an apartment, LAPD Officer Lyle Knight said.

The officers used a Taser in an attempt to subdue Shephard, he said.

During the confrontation, Shephard struck officers. Fearing for their safety, the officers then shot him, he said.

Shephard was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Knight said.

Police initially reported that the officer had been stabbed during the incident. But Sgt. Mitzi Fierro said that department officials had been provided erroneous information and that the officer suffered only a minor injury after being hit with the cane. He was treated at the scene and released.

Anyone with additional information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
