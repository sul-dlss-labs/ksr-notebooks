MOBILE, Alabama -- The Mobile police officer accused of brandishing his handgun while he was drunk at a local diner has been "removed from employment with the Mobile Police Department," according to spokesman Cpl. Christopher Levy.

An internal investigation was launched in January after officials received a complaint that Sgt. Thomas Leland Terrell had brandished his weapon at a civilian while he was drunk at a Waffle House. He was not on duty at the time.

A source in the department told reporter Robert McClendon that Terrell was with a handful of other officers at the restaurant when he pulled out his gun.

It's unclear whether Terrell will face any criminal charges.

Terrell was named Alabama Officer of the Year in 2001 after he was nearly killed in a shootout with a suspected drug dealer.

According to Press-Register archives, Terrell had been patrolling the Roger Williams housing project when he approached a group of men suspected who were suspected to be in the middle of a drug deal.

One of the men ran from Terrell, who chased after him. Terrell was shot in the back, chest, wrist, leg and hip during the confrontation. He returned fire and killed the suspected drug dealer.

In a letter nominating Terrell for Officer of the Year, then-Mobile Police Chief Sam Cochran wrote Terrell was a "young and valiant police officer who stood toe-to-toe with one of society's hardened criminals and stared down death to fulfill his duty."
