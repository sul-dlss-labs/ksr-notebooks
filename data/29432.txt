A female was shot and killed, and a Shelby County sheriff’s deputy injured during an incident near Columbiana Monday night.

The incident began shortly before 6 p.m. when deputies were dispatched to a domestic disturbance in the 1400 block of Mooney Road, which is a rural area just outside of the Columbiana city limits.

Few details had been released as to what happened next, but authorities say the suspect ran over a deputy and that’s when a deputy shot the suspect.

The slain female, whose identity has not yet been released, was pronounced dead on the scene inside a vehicle.

The deputy was seriously injured. A statement from the sheriff’s office said his injuries are potentially life-threatening. He was airlifted to UAB Hospital in Birmingham. Authorities said initial reports that the deputy had been shot are not true.

The investigation is ongoing and the Shelby County Major Crimes Task Force is leading the probe.

This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
