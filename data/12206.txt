COLERAIN TOWNSHIP, OH (FOX19) - A suspect died after a crash on Monday afternoon that began in Colerain Township and ended in Fairfield.

Police say Aaron Williams, 32, was driving a 2003 Toyota Solara, headed northbound on Pippin Road, just south of Houston Road. A nearby Hamilton County sheriff tried to pull over the car on a window-tint violation, just before 11:30 a.m.

Williams refused to stop and continued heading north at speeds of over 60 miles per hour, according to authorities. He briefly lost control of the car just south of West Kemper Road, and then ran a red light at West Kemper Road.

Officers revealed the chase eventually came to an end at the intersection of Pippin and John Gray Road, an area technically in Fairfield. The Toyota drove off the road and hit a fence and tree. The chase covered 2.8 miles and 57 seconds.

Williams was taken to Mercy Fairfield Hospital and was pronounced dead at 12:02 p.m. Police say he was not wearing a seatbelt.

Investigators on scene found approximately 300 grams of marijuana inside the car, which has an approximate street value of between $2,500 to 3,000. Williams also had 13 active license suspensions at the time of the crash.

The crash remains under investigation by the Hamilton County Sheriff's Traffic Safety Unit.
