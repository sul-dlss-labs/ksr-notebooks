“It appears (the officers) were confronted by a male in his 20s with a knife,” Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said.

At some point after that, police shot the man. It was unclear how many gunshots were fired or how many officers were involved.

A knife was found at the scene, police said. No officer was injured.
