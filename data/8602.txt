Daniel Carlon, a 23-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles Police Department officers Thursday, Nov. 12, in the 1300 block of Cochran Avenue in Mid-Wilshire, authorities said.

The shooting took place after officers escorted Flor Medrano, a 30-year-old Latina, home after she filed a domestic abuse report. The officers were waiting outside Medrano's apartment when they heard screams and went to investigate. Carlon had apparently gotten into the apartment through a window and fatally stabbed Medrano before officers shot him, authorities said.

Los Angeles police investigators are trying to piece together how a highly determined attacker eluded officers watching a Mid-City apartment and managed to kill a woman who had just filed a domestic violence complaint.

Wilshire Division officers who specialize in domestic abuse were on the lookout for the man after taking Flor Medrano's report, counseling her and returning her to her Cochran Avenue apartment Wednesday evening.

The officers escorted Medrano, 30, to her door, checked to make sure the apartment appeared safe and then returned to their unmarked patrol car to watch for the suspect, officials said.

The officers later tried to check on Medrano via cellphone and tell her they were leaving but were cut off. When they reestablished contact and heard screaming, the officers rushed to the apartment and saw a man stabbing Medrano.

Unable to gain entry through a metal security door, the officers fired through a front window, fatally wounding the attacker, according to police sources who asked not to be named because of the ongoing investigation.
