DENVER – The man shot and killed by police late Tuesday night after he allegedly killed his own father was identified Thursday by the Denver Medical Examiner’s Office.

The medical examiner said the man allegedly shot and killed by his son is Quyen Le, 86, and his son is Peter Le, 52.

According to Denver police, a 911 caller told dispatch around 10:30 p.m. on Tuesday that one of his brothers was harassing their father at their home in the 2200 block of S. Clermont Street.

When police arrived to the home shortly afterward, the front door was open, and an officer saw Peter Le standing with a knife and gun in his hands inside the home, according to DPD Commander Barb Archer.

Archer said the officer yelled at the younger Le to drop the weapon, but he continued to threaten to harm his father for several minutes, and refused to drop either weapon.

Peter Le then shot his father, and the officer shot Le. Archer said the timing was “nearly simultaneous.”

Quyen Le died at the scene, while Peter Le died after being transported to Denver Health Medical Center.

Archer said the officer involved in the shooting has been with the Denver Police Department for 22 years. The officer was not injured in the shooting.
