MANCHESTER — The death of a Toms River man on Sunday in Manchester was a case of "death by cop" according to the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office.

Eighteen-year-old Limichael Shine called 911 from a home on Robin Street in Manchester asking for a police officer to come to the home he was cleaning with his mother because he was going to commit suicide, according to Prosecutor's Office spokesman Jack Sramaty.

Shine, holding a large knife as police arrived, asked officers to shoot him according to Sramaty. The spokesperson said that after the officers ordered Shine to calm down, surrender and drop the knife he instead came at them in a threatening manner.

An officer fired one shot at Shine, according to Sramaty, who said police immediately gave first aid to Shine who was hospitalized, and later died.

Sramaty said a search of the home found a handwritten note written by Shine near his body. In the note, he said his goal in calling 911 was to "commit suicide by cop" and offered an apology to the officer responding to the call. A large knife was also found in the home.

According to a Facebook page belonging to Limichael Shine, he attended Toms River High School North and was originally from Rahway.

The Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office and the Ocean County Sheriff’s Department are investigating the incident.
