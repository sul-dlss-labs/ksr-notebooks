Contra Costa County sheriff’s officials say a Bay Point man shot and killed by deputies had tried to hit them with a stolen car.

The deputies tried to pull over 34-year-old Thomas Scogland on Wednesday night after they realized he was driving a stolen Honda Accord.

Authorities say he tried to flee and crashed into a truck. When deputies approached the crash site, Scogland allegedly backed up his vehicle into the patrol car, then pointed his car toward a deputy ordering him to stop.

Deputies Tim Allen and Ken Marchese both opened fire, killing Scogland. Allen was treated for injuries to his leg.

The deputies, who have both been on the force for 11 years, have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.
