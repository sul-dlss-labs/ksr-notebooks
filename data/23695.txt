Cops say suspect was firing at passing cars

Chamblee police shot and killed a man early Sunday morning after they say he was shooting at passing cars.

The incident unfolded around 1:10 a.m. after a man was reported shot in the hand at 5522 New Peachtree Road. The shooter was believed to be driving a small silver car.

About 10 minutes later, police responded to a report of a person shooting at passing cars from the parking lot of a QuikTrip gas station at 2805 Chamblee-Tucker Road. The gunman was then seen to run to a nearby location on Quantum Road, and fire additional shots.

Chamblee police say one of their officers then shot the suspect once and took him into custody,.

He later died.

A silver car, believed to be that used by the suspect was recovered. Police believe there were four separate locations at which the gunman fired at people.

Because this was an officer-involved shooting, Chamblee Police have called in the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to review the incident.

The officer has been placed on administrative leave while the investigation continues.
