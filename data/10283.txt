OKLAHOMA CITY -- The Pushmataha County District Attorney has determined the fatal shooting of two bank robbery suspects in southeastern Oklahoma was justified.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) has released the names of all three suspects involved in the robbery. OSBI agents say Jeremy Dysart, 34, Justin Whisenhunt, 31, and Rachael Spear, 34, robbed a bank in Wright City Thursday afternoon.

Moments after the robbery, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol and Pushmataha County Sheriff's Deputies spotted the suspects' vehicle and pursued it.

The chase ended when the suspects hit a road block on Highway 3, about five miles west of Antlers. The suspects crashed their pickup truck, which had been stolen from north Texas earlier in the week.

The suspects exchanged gunfire with state troopers. Dysart and Whisenhunt were hit. Dysart died at the scene. Whisenhunt died on the way to a hospital. OSBI agents say Whisenhunt had just been released from the Tarrant County, Texas, jail.

Spear was arrested on a complaint of bank robbery. She was booked into the Pushmataha County Jail.
