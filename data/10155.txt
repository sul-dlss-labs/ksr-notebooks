A Travis County grand jury has declined to indict Austin Police Department Officer Steven Pe単a for the May 2011 fatal shooting of Gilberto Vallejo at a South Austin apartment complex.

Pe単a shot and killed Vallejo after the 30-year-old tried to break into the apartment of a former girlfriend at the English Aire apartments on Burton Drive. The girlfriend was not home, but her daughter, son-in-law, and their infant son were inside; none was injured.

Outside the apartment, Pe単a and a fellow officer ordered Vallejo to drop his weapon. Vallejo declined. As Vallejo turned toward the officers, they heard Vallejo's handgun fire. Pe単a shot Vallejo with a shotgun; the man died that morning during surgery. According to a Travis County D.A.'s Office press release, Vallejo's autopsy revealed that in addition to the shotgun blast, Vallejo also sustained a gunshot wound inflicted by his own handgun.
