Roanoke police are investigating an incident in which an officer shot a man in Northeast Roanoke early Saturday morning.

Melvin Geovanny Castillo Aguilar, a 30-year-old Roanoke resident, was shot and killed by Officer William Wood shortly after midnight, according to a press release from the Roanoke Police Department.

Wood had responded to a domestic call at an apartment in the 400 block of Frontier Road. Wood heard a scream inside the apartment and called for back-up before knocking on the door. Aguilar, who was holding a knife, opened the door and allegedly attempted to stab Wood.

Wood ordered Aguilar to drop the knife and, when he failed to do so, Wood shot him. Wood then called for paramedics, who later pronounced Aguilar dead at the scene.

According to the release, a knife was recovered at the scene, and a witness verified that Wood ordered Aguilar to drop the knife before he fired his gun.

Wood has been placed on administrative leave. The Roanoke Police Department is conducting both a criminal investigation, with results to be turned over to the commonwealthâ€™s attorney, and an internal investigation to determine if Wood followed proper procedure.
