A 20-year-old man was charged with two counts of murder today following the shooting deaths -- one of them police-involved -- of two other men within minutes of each other the night before on the Northwest Side.



Miguel Ruiz, of the 4600 block of North Central Park Avenue, is set to appear for a bond court Saturday in connection with the deaths of 25-year-old Alfredo Carranza and 19-year-old Andre Ephrame, said Andy Conklin, a spokesman for the Cook County state's attorney's office.



Ephrame, of the 6400 block of North Hamilton Avenue, was killed in a gang-related shooting about 10:30 p.m. Thursday in the 4900 block of North Troy Street, said Pat Camden, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police.



Chicago police officers who heard the shots responded and attempted to pull over a dark sport-utility vehicle leaving the area, Camden said.



When officers tried to pull over the SUV in the 5300 block of North Kedzie Avenue -– about five blocks from the first shooting –- a passenger jumped out, fired at police, and ran down an alley, Camden said.



Police returned fire and gave chase, Camden said. He said the man shot at police again and police shot back, killing the man.



That man was identified as Carranza, of the 2600 block of West Rascher Avenue.



Authorities said Ruiz is charged with first-degree murder in Ephrame's death. He's also charged with felony murder in Carranza's death since he was the getaway driver for the 25-year-old when he exchanged gunfire with the police.
