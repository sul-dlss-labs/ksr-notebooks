A Monterey Park police officer shot and killed a man who, sheriff’s deputies said, charged at him while armed with a knife in a Fire Department parking lot on Monday, May 17.

The shooting happened around 5 p.m. at the Monterey Park Fire Department’s headquarters in the 300 block of Newmark Avenue, sheriff’s officials said.

The officer was nearing the end of his shift and went to the fire station to gas up, said sheriff’s Lt. Charles Calderaro, whose department is assisting Monterey Park police in the investigation.

A man in a Nissan sport-utility vehicle followed the officer, who went to a secured parking lot.

The officer parked and got out. The man, who had a knife, got out of his vehicle and charged the officer, sheriff’s Deputy Maria Lucero said in a statement.

The officer opened fire.

The man was hit multiple times in the upper torso, Lucero said. Paramedics treated him at the scene then took him to a local hospital, where he died.

The officer wasn’t injured. The coroner’s office hadn’t released the man’s name yet, pending notification of his family.

Authorities asked anyone with information about the shooting to call the Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Bureau at 323 890-5500. Anonymous tipsters can contact Crime Stoppers at 800- 222-8477 or at lacrimestoppers.org.
