A Cheyenne woman died in a Saturday car crash while being pursued by Laramie County sheriff's deputies, according to the Wyoming Highway Patrol.

Kristina Fertig, 20, died at the scene of the crash, which also involved a Peterbilt tractor-trailer.

Deputies tried to stop Fertig's 1980 two-door Toyota as it headed south on U.S. Highway 85 near Cheyenne at about 2 a..m., according to a highway patrol release. The deputies' activated their lights and sirens, but Fertig did not pull over.

The pursuit went on for about four miles until Fertig swerved her car at, and missed, a vehicle headed in the other direction, according to the release. Deputies backed off, but left their lights and sirens on.

The crash occurred about a mile further down the highway, after Fertig's car swerved into the northbound lane without its headlights on.

Troopers say they are still investigating why Fertig was driving on the wrong side of the road without headlights.
