A woman who hit and killed an 8-year-old boy last year while going up to 120 mph during a police chase in southwest Atlanta has pleaded guilty to murder and a slew of other charges.

Ana Bolton, 22, entered a non-negotiated plea deal in the June 27, 2016, crash that killed Jamaris Davis, according to court records. Davis was on life support for two days before he died, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution previously reported. She was sentenced to life plus five years, Fulton County District Attorney spokeswoman Nakell Williams said.

Bolton stole a Dodge Challenger from a gas station before the crash, police said. Atlanta police alerted other departments about the stolen car, which was spotted in East Point on Camp Creek Parkway.

East Point police followed Bolton, who sped off when she noticed they were behind her.

Bolton eventually crashed into a car with a family of five inside. Davis was the only one killed.

Bolton pleaded guilty to 13 other charges, including aggravated assault, homicide by vehicle in the first degree and fleeing and attempting to elude police.

She will be sentenced at a later date.
