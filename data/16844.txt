Prosecutors have added charges for causing the death of an unborn child to a murder indictment against a Savannah man in the death of a homeless pedestrian.

An indictment returned by the Chatham County grand jury on Wednesday added charges of feticide and feticide by vehicle to the murder indictment against Antonio Shaimar Edwards, 29.

Those charges contend that Edwards, who is facing trial on Feb. 28 for felony murder and related charges in the death of Debbie Lou Simon on Nov. 1, 2015, also caused the death of her unborn child by striking her with an automobile. Simon is identified in that count as "the pregnant mother of said child."

Edwards also was indicted for fleeing and eluding police officers after failing to stop his car on Oglethorpe Avenue and fleeing under conditions that placed the public in danger.

He was named in three other counts of fleeing and attempting to elude in the same chase and two vehicular homicide charges in causing Simon's death.

A Georgia State Patrol probe reported that Garden City police attempted to stop Edwards on Georgia 307 and U.S. 17 for erratic driving, but Edwards fled with two children, ages 8 and 11.

Troopers chased Edwards but stopped the chase as they got closer to downtown, where Savannah-Chatham police continued the pursuit.

The vehicle attempted to go the wrong way up the exit ramp to U.S. 17, immediately crashed and then struck and killed the pedestrian, police said.

The driver crashed a second time and fled on foot up the ramp before he was apprehended.

Other charges in the indictment included DUI, two counts of endangering a child while under the influence, hit-and-run and open container.
