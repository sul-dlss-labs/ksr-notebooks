MANVEL, Texas â€“ A man suspected of being on bath salts died after he was taken into custody for attacking a relative.

Brazoria County sheriff's deputies said a 31-year-old woman called them from a home in the 10000 block of County Road 67 in the Manvel area about 11:20 p.m. Tuesday.

Investigators said the woman told them that her uncle, 52-year-old James Dortch Jr., had tackled her, wouldn't let her leave the room she was in and was tearing up the house.

The woman said Dortch had taken synthetic cocaine, commonly referred to as bath salts, detectives said.

Deputies said they went to the home and discovered that two young children were in the home at the time the woman was attacked. A neighbor, who was armed with a baseball bat, managed to get them and their mother out of the home.

The living room was in disarray with broken glass scattered across the floor, investigators said.

Detectives said Dortch was found on the living room floor and was mumbling incoherently.

Deputies tried to handcuff Dortch, but he violently resisted, officials said. Deputies used pepper spray to get him under control, handcuffed him and took him outside to wait for paramedics, investigators said.

One of the deputies, who is a certified emergency medical technician, noticed that Dortch was having trouble breathing. Dortch's handcuffs were taken off and deputies gave him CPR, officials said.

Paramedics arrived and continued life support measures. Dortch was taken to Memorial Hermann Hospital in Houston, where he died.

The cause of Dortch's death is under investigation.
