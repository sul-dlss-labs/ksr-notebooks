Dave Stone

Born and raised in Michigan, specifically Detroit and the surrounding area. Though I have lived away for several years from my childhood home, I enjoy the opportunity to return for frequent visits. No matter where I live, I will always be a "Michigander". This page is to share all things Michigan and, in so doing, I may be able to remedy a little of my homesickness.

This is My Michigan Connection.
