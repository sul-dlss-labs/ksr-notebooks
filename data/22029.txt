MANCHESTER TOWNSHIP â€” A police officer in Ocean County shot and killed a man Sunday who was threatening to set himself on fire and pointing what turned out to a fake gun after authorities arrived at his home to investigate a domestic violence report, officials said.

Richard Nordstrom, 43, was dousing himself with gasoline inside a garage behind his home in Manchester Township when officers arrived at about 2 p.m. and ordered him to drop the lighter he clutched in his hand, authorities said.

Nordstrom complied, but then pointed the imitation handgun at an officer, who shot him several times, according to Marlene Lynch Ford, the Ocean County Prosecutor. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officers have been called on "numerous occasions" to Nordstrom's home to investigate reports of domestic violence, authorities said.

The shooting is being investigated by the Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, which reviews police-involved shootings as a matter of standard procedure.
