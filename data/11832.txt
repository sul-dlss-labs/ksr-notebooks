HIGH POINT, N.C. — Authorities say a suspect was killed and another person was taken to the to the hospital Thursday morning after a stabbing and officer-involved shooting in High Point.

According to a police spokesperson, officers responded around 4:45 a.m. to a 911 call regarding a stabbing at the Sheraton Towers at 400 North Main St.

Asst. Police Chief Casterline said two officers confronted the suspect, who was identified as 60-year-old Danny David Ferguson, in the lobby.

In a news release, police said Ferguson ignored commands to drop the weapon and “quickly started approaching the officers.”

Chief Casterline said both officers shot Ferguson.

Police said the officers performed CPR once Ferguson was down, but he died.
