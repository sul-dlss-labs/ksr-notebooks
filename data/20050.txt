HEBER CITY — A man died from what police say appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a standoff with police late Friday night.

Provo Police Department posted on their facebook page that at 10:30 p.m. Friday officers responded to student housing at Seven Peaks Blvd after a shot was fired through an apartment window. No one inside the apartment was injured, but a female occupant said that a male had been stalking her and sent texts claiming that the man was going to commit self-harm.

Provo police asked other agiences for help in tracking down the male, believed to be driving a white Mazda 6.

Heber police officer Xela Thomas said that Heber police were able to locate and pull over the vehicle at around 11:20 p.m. at Heber City Park and attempted to make contact with the man but received no response, Thomas said. Police believed the man was “armed and had barricaded himself in the vehicle," according to the police statement on Facebook.

The Summit Wasatch Advanced Tactical Team was deployed and a total of four nearby residences were evacuated Thomas said.

At 1:15 a.m. on Saturday, police determined that the man “died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” police said.

Thomas said that it appeared the man had shot himself shortly after the incident began.

Police are not releasing the name of the man at this time. Freeman Stevenson is a web producer at KSL.com
