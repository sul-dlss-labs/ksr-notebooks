ALBION, Ill. â€” An Oklahoma man reportedly took his own life Monday following a nearly 11-hour standoff with police at a motel in Albion, Illinois.

Cory Allen Hicks, 40 of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, was pronounced dead shortly before 2 p.m. Monday at the Albion Motel.

Illinois State Police said authorities went to the motel around 3 a.m. Monday to do a welfare check on a guest at the motel. When they arrived they were met by a man holding a handgun threatening to harm himself. The man, later identified by the Edwards County Coroner as Hicks, retreated back into the motel room and refused to speak to police.

The motel was evacuated as an Illinois State Police SWAT team surrounded the building. Illinois Route 15 was closed to traffic near the scene, and the Edwards County K-12 school was placed on lockdown as officials tried to negotiate with the armed man. The school is located across the road from the motel.

A State Police crisis negotiator spoke with Hicks throughout the day but was unable to convince him to give up. At 1:50 p.m., authorities entered the motel room where they found Hicks dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Edwards County Coroner Mark Curtis said Hicks was an over-the-road trucker. Curtis said a friend of the victim had phoned a suicide hotline in Oklahoma about Hicks, which lead authorities to the motel in Albion. A handgun was recovered from the scene, Curtis said.

An autopsy was scheduled for later Tuesday.
