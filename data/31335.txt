Police officials said two off-duty police officers and several citizens first spotted Horton walking on Superior and East 31st Street, pointing a gun at cars driving by and firing shots in the air.

The off-duty officers followed the man, who continued walking west on Superior, until two on-duty officers arrived, officials said.

The officers ordered Horton to put down his gun. Cleveland Police Patrolmen’s Association President Jeff Follmer said Horton initially complied, but picked up the gun and fired at the officers.

Witnesses told cleveland.com/The Plain Dealer that the officers took cover behind a police cruiser and fired back at Horton, killing him. No one else was injured during the incident.

Bullets hit nearby buildings, including the Cleveland Metropolitan School District’s downtown headquarters.

The shooting happened several blocks away from FirstEnergy Stadium, about a half-hour before the Browns-Ravens game ended.
