During the hearing, Mr. Arzu’s relatives sat in a packed courtroom in the Bronx Hall of Justice, along with reporters, prosecutors, police officers and officials from the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association. Before the sentencing, both Mr. Arzu’s daughter and Mr. Lora, 39, made emotional pleas for fairness to Justice Clancy.

“I want you to give Lora prison time,” the daughter, Katherine Arzu, 22, told the judge in a faltering voice, adding that such a sentence would bring her family a measure of peace.

A few minutes later, Mr. Lora, who was fired from the Police Department shortly after his conviction, asked the judge for clemency. His hands trembled as he read from a piece of paper and wiped his eyes with a handkerchief, expressing regret over his actions and their consequences, both for his victim and for himself.

“I’m truly sorry for their loss, and my prayers are with them,” he said of Mr. Arzu’s family. “I have lost everything due to this case.”

After the sentencing, Mr. Lora’s lawyer, Stuart London, said he would appeal the guilty verdict. Justice Clancy ruled that Mr. Lora could remain free on $50,000 bail until that process was finished.
