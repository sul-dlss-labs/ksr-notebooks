A Toms River man was pronounced dead at the scene after he was struck by a Lacey Township police cruiser in the early morning hours of July 5, according to the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office. A preliminary investigation determined that Neil Van De Putte, 25, was crossing against the traffic signal at 3:25 a.m. in a northerly direction from the south side of Lacey Road at the Deerhead Lake Drive intersection when he was struck by a Lacey patrol car responding to another call, said spokesman Al Della Fave.

Patrolman Andrew Slota was traveling east on Lacey Road on his way to the call when his patrol car struck Vandeputt, Della Fave said. “Witness information indicates Officer Slota initially took evasive action to avoid striking the pedestrian,” Della Fave said. ”However, Van De Putte was struck by the front passenger side of the patrol vehicle. After impact, Slota’s patrol vehicle struck a utility pole on the westbound side of the road coming to a final rest in the bank parking lot adjacent to the roadway.”
