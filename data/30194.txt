A deputy shot and killed a man who allegedly advanced toward a deputy while wielding a crowbar during a confrontation west of Perris, sheriff’s officials said Saturday.

Deputies responded to an assault with a deadly weapon call at 7:21 p.m. Friday in the 22000 block of Margarth Street and learned that a man had struck another person with a crowbar during an argument, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.

When deputies arrived at the location, they found the man in a nearby field still in possession of the crowbar, Sgt. Lionel Murphy said.

Deputies fired a Taser at the man after he failed to comply with commands, but it was ineffective, according to Murphy.

“The suspect advanced toward one of the deputies with the crowbar in his hand and a deputy-involved shooting occurred. One deputy fired his service weapon striking the suspect. The crowbar was recovered at the scene,” Murphy said.

Deputies provided medical aid to the man, who was taken to a hospital, where he later died of his injuries.

His identity was withheld pending notification of his family.

No deputies were injured and the victim of the assault suffered non-life threatening injuries, which did not require medical treatment, authorities said.

The deputy involved in the shooting was not publicly identified and was placed on administrative leave per sheriff’s department policy.

The Riverside County District Attorney’s Office will lead the investigation into the shooting with the assistance of the sheriff’s Force Investigations Detail.
