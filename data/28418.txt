While waiting for SWAT to arrive, officials say they tried to negotiate with Reyes and block traffic to the area, but "several vehicles and pedestrians drove or walked around officers in this densely populated and heavily traveled area, and a significant danger to the public remained."

During negotiations, police say Reyes exited his vehicle, stepped onto the highway, and started to fire his rifle, hitting a Chamblee police vehicle at least twice.

Officers returned fire, hitting Reyes at least once.

Medics transported Reyes to an area hospital where he later died, Georgia Bureau of Investigation confirmed.

According to investigators, no officers were injured during the shooting.

A GBI investigation continues.
