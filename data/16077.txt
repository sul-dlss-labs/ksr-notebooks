BEACON >> A 38-year-old man who had carjacked a vehicle in southern Dutchess County was shot and killed by police after he threatened them with a knife, authorities said Friday.

The shooting happened at about 3:30 p.m. Thursday just off Interstate 84, near Exit 11, in the city of Beacon.

State police said Beacon police officers pursued the suspect, Michael G. Murphy of West Simsbury, Conn., after he carjacked the vehicle at knifepoint at Memorial Park.

Police said Murphy abandoned the vehicle and was chased on foot through a wooded area and across the highway, not far from the east end of the Newburgh-Beacon Bridge.

Beacon police shouted to him to drop the weapon, according to eyewitness Ellen Friedman, from the town of Newburgh.

Friedman told MidHudsonNews.com that she was with her husband driving on the highway and saw the entire incident.

“He had this big old knife – a tall-ish guy, bald-headed, wearing a T-shirt and jeans – ran up the embankment a little bit, like pushing fences into some backyards, and they were yelling at him and he scrambled, turned around and raised the knife above his head and started waiving the knife around, and I heard four shots and the guy fell down, right through the chest. I saw puffs of smoke come out the chest,” Friedman said.

She said the man was about 10 feet away from the officers as he wielded the knife.

From what she observed, Friedman said, the police appeared justified in shooting the man.

A portion of the highway was closed for about six hours as authorities investigated the shooting, causing a 2-mile traffic backup.
