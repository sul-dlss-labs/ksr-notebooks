CHICAGO (WLS) -- Chicago police fatally shot a man suspected of shooting three people Sunday morning in the East Garfield Park neighborhood, police said.

Officers were on patrol at about 12:23 a.m. in the 3400-block of West Madison Street when they heard gunshots, police said. After observing the suspect fleeing the scene, officers chased him into an alley in the 3300-block of West Monroe Street and the suspect pulled out a gun, prompting one of the officers to shoot him, police said.

The suspect was wounded several times and transported to a hospital for treatment where he was pronounced dead, police said.

The victim was identified as Herbert Johnson, 34, of Chicago, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office.

Police said that three people were discovered wounded in the 3400-block of West Madison Street. A 51-year-old woman was shot in the chest, a 21-year-old man was wounded in the buttocks and a 21-year-old woman sustained a graze wound to her leg. The three were injured in the initial round of gunfire, police said.

No officers were injured in the shooting. Police said a weapon was recovered from the scene.

In the wake of the Department of Justice's report on CPD, some activists are skeptical of the department.

"We're just not inclined to give Chicago police the benefit of the doubt when it comes to patrolling our community," said Eric Russell of the Tree of Life Justice League of Illinois.

The officers involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative duties for 30 days as the Independent Police Review Authority investigates.
