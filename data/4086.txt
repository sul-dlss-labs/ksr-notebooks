PARMA, Ohio - Police in Parma say an officer fatally shot a man who aimed a shotgun at officers.

Police say 39-year-old Kenneth Lee Grinder died on the operating table Wednesday at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. He was shot once in the abdomen.

Police say they responded to a fight between Grinder and his girlfriend, but he was gone. Officers returned when Grinder was back near the house sitting in his car.

Officers took cover when they saw Grinder had a shotgun. He got out of the car with the gun and officers ordered him to drop it. Instead he pointed it at them.

Police say officer James Manzo fired three shots. Grinder did not fire back. The 14-year veteran has no other shooting on his record.

All shootings by officers are investigated under police policy.
