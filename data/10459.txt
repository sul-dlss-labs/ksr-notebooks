Crime & Safety Inquest Ordered Into Fatal Police Shooting of Shoreline Resident David Albrecht Fact-finding hearing before six-member jury determine causes and circumstances of any death involving a member of law enforcement while in performance of duties Reply

King County Executive Dow Constantine today ordered an inquest into the fatal shooting of David Albrecht of Shoreline by two Shoreline Police officers on August 10, 2011.

Police responding to Albrecht’s home in the 700 block of North 200th Street say they found a bloodied woman who told them her boyfriend was inside and was suicidal. Police say the 22-year old man emerged from the home armed with a shotgun and a knife, and did not respond to commands to drop the gun. King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg recommended the inquest after his office reviewed materials from the King County Sheriff’s Office, which conducted the investigation. The city of Shoreline contracts with the King County Sheriff for police services.

Inquests are fact-finding hearings conducted before a six-member jury. Under a standing Executive Order they are routinely called to determine the causes and circumstances of any death involving a member of any law enforcement agency within King County while in the performance of his or her duties. Inquests provide transparency into law enforcement actions so the public may have all the facts established in a court of law. The ordering of an inquest should carry no other implication. Inquest jurors answer a series of interrogatories to determine the significant factual issues involved in the case, and it is not their purpose to determine whether any person or agency is civilly or criminally liable.
