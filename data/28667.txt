Deputies shot and killed a 39-year-old man accused of stabbing his father at a Rancho Cucamonga home Tuesday, officials said.

The stabbing was reported shortly before noon at a residence in the 9400 block of Fairway View Place.

The father called authorities to report that his son — identified as 39-year-old Mark Dawson Jr. — had stabbed him and was fighting with him, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.

Dawson was armed with multiple knives and continued to make threats against his father and responding deputies, officials said.

Deputies say they forced their way into the home after they were unable to get the son to comply with their orders.

At least one deputy ended up opening fire and killing the son, according to the Sheriff’s Department. He was pronounced dead at the home.

It’s unclear what prompted deputies to shoot and whether Dawson remained armed at the time.

The father was taken to a local hospital and is expected to survive, authorities said.

Knives used in the attack were recovered at the scene, officials said.

Sheriff’s homicide detectives are investigating the incident, and no further details were immediately available.
