The man shot and killed by an Asbury Park police officer Tuesday night was brandishing a pair of scissors, authorities said Wednesday evening.

James Manzo, 27, died in the shooting at the Asbury Inn, the state Attorney General’s office said in a statement Wednesday night.

The shooting occurred at the boarding house on 7th Avenue near Webb Street after 10 p.m. Tuesday. Asbury Park officers were called there after reports Manzo was behaving erratically, authorities said.

Officers went to Manzo’s room, where they tried to talk with him in the doorway. Manzo tried to shut the door on the officers and then emerged from behind the door wielding the scissors, authorities said.

One officer fired at Manzo, who was wounded and taken to Jersey Shore University Medical Center, in Neptune. He was pronounced dead there at 10:52 p.m.

The statement did not name the officer or say how many shots were fired.

The attorney general’s office said no further information would be released while it investigates the case, in accordance with a law requiring a state investigation of anyone killed by a police officer in New Jersey.
