ROSWELL, N.M. (KRQE) – New Mexico State Police are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting that happened in Roswell Thursday night. The incident reportedly took place following a police pursuit and ended on 19th Street and N. Main Street near the James Polk Stone Community Bank.

According to the Roswell Police Department, officers assisted the Chaves County Sheriff’s Office after the suspect vehicle, a white Ford pick-up, fled from a deputy during an attempted traffic stop around 11:30 p.m. RPD officers deployed two sets of tire deflation devices, which the suspect avoided.

Authorities say the truck then drove into the parking lot of the bank. The driver, 22-year-old Victor Ivan Barron, exited the vehicle with a gun in his hand and fled on foot north on the east side of the bank, according to a New Mexico State Police press release. Officials say that’s when two RPD officers and a CCSO deputy fired at least one round at Barron, striking him.

Barron was transported to Eastern New Mexico Medical Center where he later died from his injuries. According to the Roswell Police Department, all officers and deputies involved in the incident are okay. The RPD officers who fired shots have been placed on administrative leave.

The investigation remains ongoing. The names of the officer and deputy involved will not be released until all interviews are completed.
