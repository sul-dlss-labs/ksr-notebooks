OMAHA Â— A Cass County grand jury has cleared two Nebraska State Patrol officers in the fatal shooting of an armed Avoca man in a standoff in September.

Assistant Saunders County Attorney Deb Gilg, who served as special prosecutor, said the grand

jury met Thursday and Friday to review the Sept. 24 fatal shooting of Mahlon Wolfe, 28.

Gilg said the patrol officers were called to assist Cass County sheriff's deputies with a suicidal person barricaded inside his home.

More than two hours later, Wolfe, who was armed with a shotgun, came out of his house, then pointed the gun at state troopers. Two troopers fired. Wolfe died of gunshot wounds.

The grand jury determined the circumstances led the officers to believe use of deadly force was immediately necessary to protect other officers.

The troopers involved have not been named.
