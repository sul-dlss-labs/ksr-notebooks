PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - The district attorney has finished the investigation into a deadly crash in Monroeville, where the victim was struck by a police officer.

Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala said it's common practice to investigate a fatal accident involving a police officer. In this case, they found no evidence of any wrongdoing.

On Oct. 3, 48 -year-old Michael Barnes was struck and killed on Monroeville Boulevard when he was hit by a patrol car.

Zappala said they learned Barnes had been drinking the night of the accident. Barnes was crossing at a dangerous and well-traveled section of the highway, the officer was looking straight ahead and never saw him coming.

"I can't find negligence, much less criminal negligence. There's nothing, He is on patrol, he's reviewing the back of the buildings on Monroeville Boulevard. Apparently, you can see from the photographs, that's a traveled area. Pedestrians have been using that for quite some time and something should be done about that. I am not sure what the answer is," Zappala said.

Zappala said the computer in the officer's patrol car was a little high and should be lowered so it doesn't block his vision.

All of the information will be turned over to Barnes' family. There is no word if the family will file a civil lawsuit at this time.
