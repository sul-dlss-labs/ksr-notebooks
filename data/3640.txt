A man died early Sunday in a shootout with an off-duty Chicago police officer and her husband, a security guard, near the couple's Auburn-Gresham home, police said.

Edward Harvey, 43, of an unknown address died at the scene after gunfire in the 7900 block of South Winchester Avenue, authorities said.

Neither the officer nor her husband was injured in the shooting, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

"The officer was put in the situation of a gunfight and responded," Camden said. "Multiple shots were fired on both sides."

Signs of the gunfight still were evident Sunday afternoon. A car parked near the driveway where Harvey had been shot had its rear and driver's-side windows shattered by gunfire.

Camden said police still were piecing together details of the shooting, but a neighbor said the off-duty officer and her husband were in their second-floor apartment around 1:40 a.m. when they learned that an armed man had threatened their son across the street.

Camden declined to explain the son's role in the shooting.

When the couple, both armed, went outside, Harvey raised his weapon at them and started firing, Camden said. The officer and her husband returned fire, striking Harvey, Camden said.

"The next thing I know, they were shooting," said a neighbor, who counted more than 10 shots.

"As soon as the gunfire ended, the police were here."

An autopsy scheduled for Monday will determine whose gun fired the fatal shots, Camden said.

Chicago police conducted a roundtable discussion on the shooting Sunday morning. The results will not be available until Monday, Camden said.

In 1999, Harvey was sentenced to 2 years in prison on a gun charge, court records show.

Camden said the officer was assigned to the Englewood District.

Camden declined to comment on whether the officer or her husband called 911 before confronting Harvey.

"But that's part of the investigation," Camden said.
