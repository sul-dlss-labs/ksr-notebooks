Statler was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Both officers, one with the department for 10 years, the other with four years on the force, were taken to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Westwood for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said.

Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta told a reporter at the hospital that one of the officers, who is in his late 20s, suffered an injured right arm, and investigators were trying to determine if he had been shot, cut or injured by other means. The other officer, who is in his late 20s or early 30s, suffered a gunshot wound to a thumb, Fronterotta said.

“My officers sustained non-life threatening wounds,” Fronterotta said. “They’re in good condition.”

The Church of Scientology International praised police in a statement released Wednesday night.

“We thank the Inglewood Police Department for their rapid response in protecting our parishioners and staff members,” the statement said. “These officers are doing a heroic job protecting the community and keeping houses of worship safe against hate crimes.”
