KINGSPORT - One person was killed late Friday night in a single car crash in Kingsport, authorities said.

Tennessee Highway Patrol personnel are investigating to determine if the car involved in the wreck was the same one that fled from a trooper who terminated the chase minutes before the vehicle wrecked, official said.

According to a Tennessee Highway Patrol report from the Fall Branch District, Anthony Dwayne Leonard, 23, of Bristol, Va., died from injuries sustained in the 10:25 p.m. crash that occurred near the intersection of State Highway 2372 and Bancroft Chapel Road. Leonard was not wearing a seat belt, drugs did appear to be a contributing factor in the wreck and a test was ordered, officials said.

Trooper Sollie Rabun investigated the crash and reported that the 2002 Lexus driven by Leonard was seen traveling east on Bloomingdale Pike at a high rate of speed. The Lexus ran off the left side of the road, rotated clockwise and struck a block retaining wall before it overturned onto its top, Rabun reported.

According to the report, moments before this crash, Trooper Nathan Hall had clocked a light-colored vehicle speeding on Packinghouse Road and the vehicle as Hall was turning around to pursue the car. Hall reported he lost sight of the vehicle near Bloomingdale Pike and ended the chase on Bancroft Chapel Road, officials said.

Authorities said that moments later troopers were notified of the overturned vehicle crash. It was not known if the crashed vehicle was the same one that fled from Hall and narcotics were found at the crash, the Highway Patrol reported.

An investigation is continuing.
