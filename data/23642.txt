Police said the woman who died fired a pellet gun at officers, injuring two of them.

Right now, the woman's son is in the Washington County jail.

Mike Livingston is in jail on several drug and weapons complaints.

His arrest affidavit said he made threats to kill drug task force officers and their children.

While four Bartlesville police officers were taking Michael Livingston into custody Wednesday night, they said they heard a popping noise.

"This all happened rather quickly," said Bartlesville Police Captain Jay Hastings.

Officers said that popping sound was Geraldine Townsend shooting at officers with a high-powered pellet gun, hitting one in the leg, and one in the face.

The officer hit in the face fired back at Townsend.

"At this point, it appears he fired one round," Hastings said.

72-year-old Townsend died in the hospital.

Her family said she was a happy person who loved her family and going to church.

She leaves behind several children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.

Police said the officer that Townsend shot in the face had to undergo surgery to remove the pellet.

"The replica pellet guns are just as dangerous as the real guns," said Hastings.

Officers said they went to the house in the first place to arrest Livingston for selling drugs.

His arrest affidavit said officers found a mason jar of what appears to be marijuana, surveillance cameras, and monitors, a police scanner and three pellet guns inside the home.

The district attorney will determine whether the shooting is justified.

The officer who shot Townsend is on paid administrative leave.
