MANITOWOC - The Wisconsin Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation, at the request of the Manitowoc County Sheriff’s Office, is investigating a high-speed crash involving Deputy Brandon Radke that led to the death of 25-year-old Chris Klein, of Two Rivers, on Dec. 16.

According to a sheriff’s report, Radke — who has been in law enforcement for six years — attempted to stop the driver of a Lincoln Town Car for multiple traffic violations at about 5:38 p.m. Dec. 16 at State 147 and South Main Street in Mishicot. The driver, a 48-year-old Two Rivers man, instead took off southbound on State 147, and Radke chased him. The chase lasted about 4 miles and reached speeds of 100 miles per hour.
