A man who died after being shot by a police officer in Huber Heights has been identified.

Police said Shannon R. Spencer, 39, died after the officer fired shots in an incident at Spencer's home Monday night.

The man made "suicide by cop" threats before exiting the home carrying a gun and refusing to disarm himself at the urging of officers.

Officers subsequently shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene shortly after.

Huber Heights police were initially called to the residence in the 4000 block of Paletz Court on the report of a domestic violence case involving a weapon.

An adult female told officers she had fled the home on Paletz with her three children after her husband, who was intoxicated inside with a firearm, had made threats to harm himself.

Police secured a perimeter around the home and called in assistance from the Huber Heights Police Department's Regional Emergency Response Team.

Authorities were able to communicate with Spencer through a window of the home and by telephone and negotiators worked to get him to come out. At this time Spencer made "suicide by cop" threats to the officers who were communicating with him, police said.

Spencer eventually exited the home at the front door carrying a firearm and police urged him to put the gun down, but he refused to listen to police orders. A Huber Heights officer fired at least one shot.

Spencer died from the shots fired by the Huber Heights officer. Police at this time have not released how many rounds were fired at the suspect.

A Montgomery County coroner's investigator arrived at the scene of the shooting at about 11:45 p.m.

Neighbors around the home were ordered to stay inside during the incident, which lasted almost an hour.

Huber Heights Police Detectives are conducting an official investigation into the incident.

The officer who fired the shots has not been identified. He has been put on paid administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing.
