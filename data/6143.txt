Fort Dodge man dies after motorcyle crashes

A 22-year-old Fort Dodge man died Monday after his motorcycle went off a road northwest of Fort Dodge. The Iowa State Patrol identified the man as Brandon M. Halbach. Authorities say Halbach was on his motorcycle, traveling north on a Webster County road, he apparently did not round a curve.

Halbach and his bike then went straight ahead off the road, down an embankment, hit a tree and then rolled several times. He was pronounced dead at the scene. A state trooper had clocked a motorcycle traveling 96 miles an hour and began a chase, but lost sight of a speeding motorcycle after it turned onto the road where Halbach wrecked.
