San Bernardino police were legally justified in shooting a 43-year-old man late last year as he raised a pistol toward officers, although he shot himself in the head as the officer opened fire, prosecutors say.

Jon McAllister Taylor died of the self-inflicted head wound and the other gunshot wound in his chest Nov. 28 outside his apartment along the 4900 block of North Sierra Way.

Taylor’s wife had summoned officers to the home, saying he had a gun and had already fired the weapon two or three times. With a SWAT team surrounding the apartment, Taylor twice came outside holding a 9mm Glock pistol, which — during his second trip outdoors — he raised toward police, prompting Officer Johnny Mack Turner to open fire almost simultaneously with Taylor.

“There is no way to tell if Mr. Taylor intended solely to shoot himself, which did happen,” Chief Deputy District Attorney Karen Bell said in a 10-page analysis of the incident. “But legally, Officer Turner was not required to wait and see.

“A delay in acting … might have resulted in a member of the public or a police officer being shot.”

Turner told investigators he made his decision to shoot when he saw Taylor move his index finger onto the trigger and raise the pistol in the direction of two other officers as Taylor looked in their direction.

“Turner felt his fellow officers were in danger of being shot,” Bell wrote. “His conclusion was reasonable under the circumstances he observed and what information had been given to him about Mr. Taylor’s conduct.”
