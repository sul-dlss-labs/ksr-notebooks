MORENO VALLEY – A suspect wanted in connection with a kidnapping and an assault with a deadly weapon was shot to death by deputies outside a Moreno Valley home where he had been barricaded, authorities said Sunday.

About 6:35 p.m. on Saturday, April 3, deputies approached a home in the 16000 block of La Fortuna Lane looking for the suspect, identified as Juan Carlos Estrada, 40, of Corona.

Deputies gave him verbal commands to exit the home over their patrol vehicle speakers, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department. However, Estrada refused to follow deputies’ commands, sheriff’s spokeswoman Sgt. Deanna Pecoraro said.

In the meantime, a sheriff’s dispatcher received a call from inside the home suggesting the suspect was armed with a gun, according to Pecoraro.

“A few moments later, Estrada exited the home running toward the deputies and their patrol cars. At that time, a deputy-involved shooting occurred. Estrada was struck by the gunfire, and despite lifesaving measures, he was pronounced deceased on scene,” Pecoraro said.

No deputies were injured in the shooting, and it was unclear if Estrada was armed when deputies shot him.

The involved deputies — whose names were not released — were placed on administrative leave, according to Pecoraro. An investigator from the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office will lead the investigation into the fatal shooting with the assistance of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department Force Investigations Detail.
