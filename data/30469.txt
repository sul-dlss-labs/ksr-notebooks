HEATH TOWNSHIP, Mich. (WOOD) — A man was shot and killed by a Michigan State Police trooper near Hamilton Monday afternoon, authorities said.

It happened around 3 p.m. at a mobile home park in Heath Township on Oak Road near 132nd Avenue.

MSP says a trooper was responding to a breaking and entering incident that was in progress. Upon arrival, authorities say the suspect was in the front yard of a home, where an altercation of some sort took place.

A trooper fired a single gunshot at the suspect. Life-saving efforts were performed on the man, but he died at the scene, according to authorities.

It’s unclear if the suspect was armed.

MSP says that the trooper involved sustained minor injuries to the face, which shows that the altercation was physical.

No one else was hurt.

“The Michigan State Police would like to give our heartfelt sympathies to the person who lost their life today. We give our sympathies to his family. It’s never an officer’s goal to have a day where they have to take someone’s life,” MSP Spl. Lt. DuWayne Robinson said at the scene.

State police says the trooper was not wearing a body camera at the time, adding that the cruiser has a dashcam. It’s unknown yet if the dashcam was properly working at the time of the incident.

The homeowner and suspect knew each other, MSP said.

The names of the trooper and the man killed are being withheld at this point in the investigation.

The officer involved has been placed on administrative leave.

The MSP Fifth District Incident Response Team will complete an internal investigation before forwarding it to the Allegan County Prosecutor’s Office for review.
