DETROIT -- Authorities say a 17-year-old charged with murder in a double-fatal accident has died after crashing another stolen vehicle in Detroit.Authorities say Gary Williams crashed a stolen U.S. Army van Aug. 9, killing 19-year-old Unique Neely and 20-year-old LaVette Lee.

The Detroit News says state police didn't process DNA evidence from the August crash because of a backlog caused by the closing of Detroit's crime lab.

Detroit police say Williams was driving a stolen car Friday with four other teens aboard when he ignored a red light and hit another car. Williams died Sunday.

Wayne County prosecutor's spokeswoman Maria Miller says the hospitalized Williams was charged Saturday with two counts of second-degree murder.
