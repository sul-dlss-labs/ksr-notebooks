DENVER (AP) â€” Three police officers have been cleared in the fatal February shooting of an armed man in Denver.

The Denver Post reports that the Denver district attorney concluded the officers were legally justified in the shooting death of 40-year-old David Litton in February.

A statement released Wednesday by District Attorney Beth McCann says the officers were in imminent danger of being killed or seriously injured when they shot Litton nine times.

Authorities say Litton threatened to shoot officers over the phone during a standoff at an apartment complex.

Litton's son was injured and barricaded in a bathroom.

Police say Litton came out holding a semi-automatic handgun and did not respond when officers repeatedly yelled at him to drop the gun.

Authorities say Litton got within 7 feet (2.13 meters) before the three officers fired.
