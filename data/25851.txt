Two New York State troopers searching a Bronx house early yesterday shot and killed a 29-year-old man who had fired on them, the authorities said. One of the troopers was shot in the leg, and the other escaped serious injury when two bullets struck his protective armor, the authorities said.

The man, Michael Londonio, called an "upper-level" drug dealer by prosecutors, was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said. Trooper Peter Verdesi, 38, was shot in his left calf and was recovering yesterday at Jacobi Medical Center. Trooper Mark Ennis, 34, whose protective vest and ballistic helmet might have saved his life, was taken to Jacobi for observation and then released, said First Deputy Superintendent Preston Felton of the New York State Police.

A coincidence of timing added to the gravity of the shootings.

The exchange of gunfire occurred about 6 a.m., just hours before the funeral of a New York City police officer killed last week while trying to make an arrest in Brooklyn. The officer, Dillon Stewart, died in the hospital after a bullet passed through an armhole in his protective vest and struck him in the heart.

"I think we all realize the seriousness that troopers and police officers encounter when they are involved in the execution of a warrant or in the attempt to make an arrest," said Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, who spoke to reporters at Jacobi.
