DeWayne Chatt

WEST MEMPHIS, AR (WMC-TV) - An inmate's death in the Crittenden County Jail could be linked to a taser gun.

According to officials, 39-year-old DeWayne Chatt may have been tasered up to five times by West Memphis police during an arrest.

Chatt arrived at the Crittenden County Jail at 1:04am Thursday, and was pronounced dead in his cell at 2:14am.

According to officials, Chatt was arrested after a scuffle with officers apparently got out of hand. The altercation took place in the manager's office of a Dodge's Chicken store in West Memphis. That was when, police said, Chatt ran and hid from them.

Thursday, the use of taser guns to subdue Chatt was part of a Crittenden County Sheriff's Department investigation into his death.

"Anytime an inmate dies in our custody, that's of great concern to us," Sheriff Tommy Martin said. 'To make sure there wasn't any wrongdoing here, and to see if he had any medical issues we weren't aware of."

Chatt's body was sent to the crime lab in Little Rock for an autopsy. Family members said he had medical problems, and they believe the use of tasers may have triggered his death.

West Memphis police said it is standard procedure to use a taser when a suspect fails to comply with a command.
