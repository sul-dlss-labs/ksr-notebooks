HAMILTON -- The Hamilton man shot by police earlier this month when he was found repeatedly stabbing his father and refused to drop the knife died Wednesday from his gunshot wounds, authorities said Friday.

Shawn Clyde, 36, had remained at Capital Health Regional Medical Center in Trenton since the April 1 incident, but has since succumbed the injuries, Casey DeBlasio, spokeswoman for the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office said.

Hamilton Police shot Clyde around 5:30 p.m. in the Kuser Village Apartments on Nottinghill Lane Wednesday after he refused to drop a knife he had used to stab his 54-year-old father, prosecutors have said.

The father's name has not been released. Clyde's mother also suffered stab wounds when she tried to intervene, police have said.

Clyde and his father were taken to Capital Health in critical condition, prosecutors have said. The condition of the father was not immediately known Friday.

The two officers involved in shooting were placed on paid administrative leave while the Mercer County Prosecutor's Office investigates, authorities have said.
