Authorities tried to determine Wednesday what led to a three-car collision involving an unmarked LAPD car that killed a 45-year-old Burbank woman, police said.

Officers believe Guadalupe Avila lost control of her vehicle Tuesday at about 6:30 p.m., ran into the rear of the police car on Van Nuys Boulevard and then crossed into oncoming traffic, hitting a third vehicle in a busy Van Nuys intersection.

She died after suffering massive abdominal injuries, Det. Steve Schiltz said.

The police car was driven by Officer Duane Aikins, 33, and another officer was a passenger, Schiltz said.

The other driver, Thomas Martorano, 81, of Sherman Oaks, and the police officers escaped major injury, authorities said.

“The light had just changed to green, so luckily cars were driving slowly when she hit the third car,” Schiltz said.
