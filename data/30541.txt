Kentucky State Police released limited information on a fatal officer-involved shooting that happened in Florence on Wednesday.

KSP said the United States Marshals Service asked their office to investigate an officer-involved shooting at which point the detectives with the Critical Incident Response Team responded to the scene in Boone County.

Investigators with KSP said their preliminary findings indicate the U.S. Marshals Service attempted to execute multiple arrest warrants for someone who lived on Garden Drive in Florence.

When Marshals made contact with the suspect, the individual fired a weapon, according to KSP.

According to investigators, a brief standoff followed with the individual brandishing a firearm until law enforcement officials fired shots at the individual.

KSP said the individual was struck, and life-saving measures attempted by law enforcement were unsuccessful. The individual was pronounced dead at the scene.

No officers or members of the community were injured, according to KSP.

KSP has statewide jurisdiction and investigates officer-involved shootings throughout the commonwealth as requested by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies.

The department said to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation, they will not release specific details at this time.

This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
