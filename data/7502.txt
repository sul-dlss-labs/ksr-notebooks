Two people shot in separate incidents that led to standoffs in Birmingham and Hueytown continue to recuperate at UAB Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said this morning.Spokeswoman Jennifer Lollar said Torrence Felton is back in critical condition after his condition was upgraded to serious earlier this week. Felton was found lying on the sidewalk at 519 Frances St. Tuesday afternoon shot in the head.

Police went to 541 Frances St. immediately after the shooting to talk to his family, but no one responded. After about two hours, the Birmingham Police Department's SWAT team, including snipers, surrounded the house. After several more hours, officers fired tear gas canisters into the home and entered to find Angela ''Angie'' Felton, 38, and Warren Slater, 41, shot to death in an apparent murder-suicide.

Less than 48 hours later, a similiar situation unfolded in Hueytown, when Jimyshia Howard, 22, was shot in the back of the head as she apparently tried to flee the house where her husband, Fuzell Morton III, 25, had just gunned down her mother, Sheila Renee Howard, 39.

A child in the house was released to police at the onset of a four-hour standoff that ended when police used tear gas and searched the house to find Morton and Sheila Renee Howard dead in an apparent murder suicide.

Jimyshia Howard is in serious condition today, Lollar said.
