Aaron Borden, a 26-year-old black man, was shot by LAPD Southwest police officers at 4014 S. Hobart Blvd. in South Los Angeles, and later died at California Hospital. His time of death was listed as 4 p.m. Tuesday, June 26.

Los Angeles police gave this account: Officers were dispatched to investigate a call that a man had reportedly menaced or assaulted several other people with a pistol. When police arrived, the victims had escaped, but Borden, their suspected assailant, was inside a house. Police surrounded him and called for a SWAT unit to handle the standoff. Before SWAT officers had time to get there, though, Borden walked out of the house, and confronted officers with a gun, police said. Three officers fired their weapons. They are John Flores, 32, John Davis, 27, and Alfredo Ibanez, 36. Borden's gun, a .357 Magnum, is in police custody.
