OAKLAND PARK (CBS4) â€“ The death of a suspect in police custody is under investigation by the Broward Sheriff's Office.

BSO spokesperson Dani Moschella has confirmed the death which took place in the 200 block of Lake Pointe Drive in Oakland Park.

CBS4's Kara Kostanich spoke to a woman who identified herself as the suspect's girlfriend.

The woman, Aisha Eubanks, told Kostanich she watched her boyfriend, 31-year-old James Doe, die right before her eyes after a BSO deputy used a Taser on him while he was inside a police cruiser.

"They would not let me spend the last few moments with him," said Eubanks. "He came out of the house, he didn't resist, he was yelling and upset but he followed their orders," according to Eubanks.

Eubanks says Doe showed up at her apartment Sunday night so they could breed their pit bulls. However, during the visit, Eubanks said the couple had an argument and Doe called 911 on himself.

When deputies arrived, they asked Doe to leave Eubanks' apartment. He complied but within an hour, he returned and security at the Lake Pointe Condominium community called 911.

Doe was arrested and placed into a BSO cruiser. When he started kicking in the backseat, he was tazed, according to Eubanks and she doesn't understand why.

"He was kicking inside of the police car but the door was closed," said Eubanks. "He was detained. I don't know why they had to do it."

When asked why a taser was used, BSO officials said proper protocol was used.

"He could definitely injure himself and he could definitely get out through an open window," said Moschella. "So the deputy uses that taser so he doesn't have to go hands on."

Eubanks says this isn't the first time deputies have been called regarding a domestic dispute between her and Doe, but she says she never thought it would end like this.

Moschella says the Medical Examiner will determine the official cause of death.
