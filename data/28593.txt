A Broward sheriff’s deputy is under investigation following a deadly shooting in Dania Beach.

Suspect Joshua Gay, 28, was shot about 9 p.m. and was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The name of the deputy who fired his weapon has not been disclosed but he has been placed on administrative assignment which is standard practice pending further investigation.

The incident started with a domestic dispute at about 7:22 p.m. at a home in the 5400 block of Southwest 32nd Terrace.

A woman told 911 operators she was involved in an argument with her boyfriend, Gay, that escalated to the point where he took a gun out of a safe in the home and left, investigators said.

A perimeter was set up in the area with a sheriff’s helicopter and K9 deputies joining the search for Gay.

The helicopter located Gay in the 2500 block of Stirling Road, a few blocks south of the address where the domestic disturbance was reported.

Gay was armed with a gun and a box cutter that he refused to drop. Deputies fired a stun gun but that failed to stop Gay.

Shots were fired and Gay was hit. The gun and box cutter were recovered at the scene, according to Sheriff’s Sgt. Donald Prichard.

No deputies were injured and no other injuries were reported.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.
