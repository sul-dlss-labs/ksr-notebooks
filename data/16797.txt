KENTWOOD, MI -- A 47-year-old man was shot dead by a Kentwood police officer late Wednesday night, authorities say.

Officers were called about 11:12 p.m. Oct. 21 to Sutton Club Apartments in the 1400 block of Hidden Valley Drive on a report of a suicidal person, later identified as the man who is now dead.

Two arriving officers tried to knock on the man's door but at first had no response. At some point, he left his apartment and then wielded a handgun as he confronted an officer in the hallway. He pointed that gun at the officer, police say.

The officer fired his gun, injuring the suspect, who later died. The officer, who has been on the Kentwood force for six years, was not injured, according to authorities.

Kentwood Police Chief Tom Hillen was not identifying the officer or the man who died early Thursday, Oct. 22, pending further investigation and contact with relatives of the deceased.

Kent County sheriff's authorities will be conducting an outside investigation into the shooting.
