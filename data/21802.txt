Police shot and killed a 45-year-old man in North Bergen after he allegedly stabbed three people early Monday morning, authorities said.

Initially, police responded to a 911 call reporting a fight on Union Turnpike at about 3:20 a.m., the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement. When police arrived, they found two women — a 31-year-old from North Bergen and a 34-year-old from Guttenberg — with stab wounds. A third person, a 33-year-old man from Union City, was also stabbed.

The suspect, Winston Espino Sanchez, was armed with an unspecified weapon when police used pepper spray in an attempt to stop him, authorities said. The spray didn't work, and two officers then shot Sanchez in the torso, authorities said.

Sanchez was taken to Jersey City Medical Center, but he did not survive, authorities said.

The two wounded women were hospitalized at Jersey City Medical Center, authorities said. They are expected to survive. The wounded man was treated and released from the hospital.

One witness, who declined to give her name, said she lives in the building where the incident happened. On Monday morning, she was cleaning blood, apparently from the fight, from the front driver's-side window to prevent it from drying and staining her car.

"I heard, like, three shots," she said. "I looked outside and saw two women and a man being put in an ambulance."

The man, later identified as Sanchez, appeared to be dead, she said.

Another neighbor, who also declined to give his name, said police have stopped by the residence before.

"Cops came here before because loud music was played," he said. "That's been happening for years."
