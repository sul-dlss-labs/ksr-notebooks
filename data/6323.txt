Two former Chicago police officers filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Superintendent Jody Weis and the Police Board over their firing earlier this month for engaging in an on-duty car chase that resulted in a fatality.

Brian Garcia and Aaron Poradzisz were discharged following a board decision that found they violated multiple rules of conduct by pursuing a motorcyclist for a minor traffic violation in summer 2007.

The board determined the two failed to notify their zone dispatcher that they were in pursuit of the motorcycle, left the scene of a fatal accident without rendering aid to the motorcyclist and made false reports "in an attempt to cover up their misconduct."

In a lawsuit filed in Cook County Circuit Court, the two former officers are asking a judge to overturn the board's decision, saying it was based on insufficient evidence.

They allege that when the motorcyclist increased his speed, they pulled off and never saw him crash, said their attorney, Thomas Needham.

A Police Board spokesman declined to comment.
