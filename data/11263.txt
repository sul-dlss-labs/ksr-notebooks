Christopher Wayne Snyder, 28, of Winslow was fatally shot Saturday night in a struggle after a traffic stop with State Trooper Michael Bowman, the State Police has reported. The release:

A Washington County man is dead after attempting to overpower an Arkansas State Trooper in a fight last night (Saturday, April 21) near Alma (Crawford County).

State Trooper Michael Bowman was on patrol about five miles north of Alma when he initiated a traffic stop of a vehicle about 11:30 PM. The speeding violator stopped in a driveway along the 7500 block of U.S. Highway 71.

The violator, identified as Christopher Wayne Snyder, 28, of Winslow, exited the vehicle and fled from Trooper Bowman. A foot-chase covering nearly one-quarter mile ensued before ending in the backyard of an abandoned mobile home.

Snyder refused to comply with orders from Trooper Bowman as Snyder was being taken into custody. While Trooper Bowman attempted to handcuff Snyder a fight occurred and Snyder began to choke Trooper Bowman.

As Snyder moved on top of Trooper Bowman, the Trooper was able to reach his handgun and fire the weapon striking Snyder who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Trooper Bowman was taken to a nearby hospital for examination and later released.

Trooper Bowman has been placed on administrative leave pending the review of an investigation which will be submitted for consideration by Prosecuting Attorney Marc McCune.
