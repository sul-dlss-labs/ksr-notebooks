MORGANTOWN, W.Va. â€” The driver killed in a crash on U.S. Route 19 in Monongalia County has been identified by authorities.

The incident began Thursday when Monongalia County Deputies were dispatched to the Morgantown Mall in Westover, to investigate a report of a child left unattended in a minivan.

Police spotted the van in question leaving the parking lot and tried to initiate a traffic stop on Route 19.

The driver, Ladonna Crites, 27 of Morgantown, refused to pull over and sped off headed south.

As the pursuit reached speeds between 60-70 miles per hour on the curvy road, the driver of the van lost control in a curve just past Little Indian Creek Road and went over a hill. The van came to a stop when it hit some trees about 20 yards down the hill.

Crites was pronounced dead at the scene. Two children, a toddler and an infant, were taken to Ruby Memorial Hospital, although their injuries were not believed to be life threatening.
