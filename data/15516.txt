A Zionsville man is dead following a pursuit and overnight standoff with the Indiana State Police at the Morgan-Owen county line.

Brent Kyle Krout, 39, was shot as he pointed a gun at troopers who were closing in on his disabled car, state police said in a press release.

The investigation began about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday as ISP troopers in Owen County attempted to stop Krout who was the subject of a Lawrence County methamphetamine investigation, according to Sgt. Curt Durnil.

Krout refused to stop, leading officers on a 25-minute pursuit that ended on Ind. 67 near the county line. Durnil said stop sticks were deployed and caused the man to lose control of his Ford Mustang.

He added that throughout the chase, police could see that Krout was holding a handgun and was pointing it his own head.

Durnil said once the vehicle was stopped, officers began negotiations with the man that would last four to five hours. At one point, the man fired a gunshot out of his front passenger window.

“Officers are confident that the suspect wanted them to fire on him when shot into the field, but the officers showed great restraint and did not fire on the suspect at that time,” Durnil said.

Krout got out of the car about 6:20 a.m. as members of a state police tactical team closed in. He took a defensive stance and pointed his weapon at officers, Durnil said. That is when police fired. Krout was pronounced dead at the scene.

Durnil said an autopsy is planned.
