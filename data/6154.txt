Ronald Ball, 60, a black man, was shot by LAPD Newton narcotics officers who were in plain clothes and driving a plain van, during a confrontation near the intersection of 32nd Street and Broadway just south of downtown Los Angeles. He died at 8:52 a.m. Saturday, May 19.

The police said narcotics officers working surveillance spotted a group of about five people, both black and Latino, making a drug transaction. The officers got out and detained two suspects in handcuffs. Ball ran away and was chased by Det. Eric Armstrong, 34, a veteran of 10 years. Ball got underneath a car. Armstrong got down on the ground, reached in, and began pulling him out. Ball pulled out a gun, and Armstrong shot him. Ball died at the scene. The location is within a few blocks of another deadly shooting by police earlier this year.
