A man wanted on a felony drug warrant was killed in a Phoenix police shooting on Tuesday after he pointed a weapon at officers near a west Phoenix home, according to a police spokesman.

Phoenix police fugitive-apprehension detectives arrived at a home near 35th Avenue and McDowell Road at about 3:25 p.m. after officers believed they had identified a 45-year-old man staying there who was wanted on a felony drug warrant, police said.

Officers were speaking with the man through a window in the home but could only see one of his hands, said Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman.

When officers asked to see the man's other hand, he revealed a weapon, Lewis said.

Police opened fire on the man and when the shooting stopped, he was dead. A handgun was recovered near the body, Lewis said.

No officers were injured and no one else was in the home at the time of the shooting.

Police said the investigation was ongoing and that people should expect police activity in the area of 36th Avenue and Berkeley Road with slight traffic restrictions.

Police said they were withholding the man's name until his next of kin has been notified.
