A man and woman killed in motorcycle crash while being pursued by California Highway Patrol officers were identified Wednesday.

Peter Tsueda, 38, of Altadena, and Suong Lam, 40, of Fountain Valley crashed into the back of a van on the westbound Ventura (134) Freeway, just east of the junction with the Glendale (2) Freeway shortly after 9 p.m. Monday, according to the CHP and coroner’s Assistant Chief Ed Winter.

Tsueda was driving, Winter said.

The pursuit began near the junction of the Ventura and Foothill (210) freeways in Pasadena about 9 p.m. Monday, when a CHP officer saw the motorcycle traveling “at high speeds” and tried to pull it over, said CHP Officer Ryan Bejar.

A short time later, the motorcycle crashed into the rear of a van that was going about 65 mph, Bejar said.

The van driver was uninjured, Bejar said. Anyone knowing more about the case was urged to call (626) 296-8100.
