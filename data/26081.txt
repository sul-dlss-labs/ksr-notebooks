TOLEDO, Ohio — A man running from officers died Wednesday after accidentally shooting himself, according to police.

Steven Sisler, 21, began to run after officers responded to reports of a domestic dispute at an apartment complex, although police say Sisler was not involved in the dispute, the Toledo Blade reports.

Officers did not chase Sisler, but a gunshot was heard shortly after he ran from the parking lot of the apartment complex, the Blade reports.

Sisler’s body was discovered a short time later, WTVG Channel 13 reports. Police say it appears he was trying to hop a fence when the handgun he was carrying went off, wounding him in the chest.

The shooting remains under investigation.
