A man who was shot and wounded by Anaheim police this month has died, authorities said Monday.

Petrica Peter Muntean, 24, of Anaheim died Friday, two weeks after he was shot by police in an incident at Harbor Boulevard and Broadway, said Anaheim police Sgt. Daron Wyatt.

Officers had responded on April 12 to reports of a domestic violence incident between Muntean and his mother, but Muntean fled the scene, police said.

Muntean again tried to run when officers attempted to contact him the next morning, police said.

Officers used less than lethal round to try to detain him, but “he continued to the 100 block of Seneca Circle, where an officer-involved shooting occurred,” authorities said.

Wyatt said a BB gun that resembled a firearm was recovered at the scene. The officers’ body cameras were activated at the time of the shooting, he added.

The Orange County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the case, as it does in all officer-involved shootings.
