CHP officers initially tried to stop the man, whose name has not yet been released, after he was seen taking part in an illegal sideshow in Oakland and later started speeding around 8:15 p.m. Sunday, according to CHP Officer Sean Wilkenfeld. Officers pursued the suspect onto Interstate Highway 880 but called off the chase near the O.co Coliseum for other motorists’ safety, Wilkenfeld said. A CHP helicopter was able to continue the pursuit by air, following the motorcyclist as he headed onto state Highway 238 and state Highway 580 in Castro Valley, at times speeding at over 100 mph.

The man shot off of Highway 580 at the Redwood Road exit, where an Alameda County sheriff’s deputy spotted him. But before the deputy could stop him, the motorcyclist plowed into an SUV at the intersection of Redwood Road and Castro Valley Boulevard and was ejected onto the roadway, according to CHP Officer Eric Thomas.
