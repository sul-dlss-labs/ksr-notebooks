According to reports, Meyer was called the to the scene of a disturbance on Okeana Street in Bonita Springs. Deputies said Weaver had been beating her boyfriend with a broom and potted plants. He took refuge at a neighbor’s home and the neighbor called 911. The boyfriend told deputies the fight resulted after he told Weaver he didn’t want to go drinking with her that night.

When Meyer arrived on scene, Weaver, 40, was standing in the doorway of her home, holding a pistol.

“I’ve got one chambered for you,” she told deputies, according to reports. “You guys are gonna have to (expletive) kill me.”

Meyer said he told Weaver to drop the gun multiple times, but she began to raise the weapon.

“I was in fear for my safety,” Meyer said, according to a memo from the attorney’s office. “I thought she was gonna shoot me.”

Meyer fired his Glock 40 pistol three times, hitting Weaver twice. She died when one of the bullets perforated her lung, according to the medical examiner.

Weaver, who had been drinking before the shooting, reportedly had a blood alcohol level of .219.

Russell’s ruling that Meyer’s actions were justifiable cited Florida statute that allows for deadly force when a person feels it is necessary to prevent death or great bodily harm.
