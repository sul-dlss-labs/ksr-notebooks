Sardis, GA. – On June 10, 2013, at approximately 3:00 AM, the GBI was requested to assist the Sardis Police Department with an officer involved shooting that occurred at the Sardis Police Department in Sardis, Burke County, Georgia. At approximately 2:00 AM the same date an officer with the Sardis Police Department returned to the police station located at 909 Charles Perry Avenue while on patrol. Upon approaching the station he found evidence that led him to believe that a burglary may be in progress. The officer entered the station and found that the evidence room door had been kicked in. The officer then called for assistance from the Burke County Sheriff’s Office to aid in clearing the building. Two deputies arrived and assisted the Sardis officer. One deputy was positioned at the rear of the building and the other entered with the officer.

As the officer and deputy began clearing the building they encountered a male subject in the police department’s file room. The male subject was wearing a mask and in possession of an ax. As the officers attempted to take the subject into custody, he exited the room and came towards the officers with the ax. The Sardis officer discharged his firearm striking the subject. The subject has been identified as D’Wayne Burke, 34 years old, from Burke County, Georgia. Burke is a former officer of the Sardis Police Department.

An autopsy on Burke was performed at the GBI Crime Lab in Augusta, GA and the cause of death has been ruled gunshot wound. Other laboratory testing is pending in this case.
