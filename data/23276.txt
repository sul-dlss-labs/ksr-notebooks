LYNCHBURG, Va. â€“ State police say 54-year-old Pamela Webber, of Lynchburg, died early Monday morning after being shot by an officer.

A woman was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Lynchburg Monday morning.

Around 10:35 p.m. Sunday, officers responded to a call for a suicidal person at a home in the 2900 block of Triangle Place. The caller said a woman was armed with a knife and had already harmed herself. The caller also said there was another person inside the home in extreme danger.

Over the course of several hours, officers and trained negotiators attempted to resolve the incident peacefully while the woman was barricaded in a room.

At approximately 2 a.m., the woman came out of the room wielding a knife and advanced on the officers in a threatening manner. Officers repeatedly told her to drop the knife but she refused.

Officers first utilized less-than-lethal force options, including a Taser, but the woman continued to advance on the officers, according to the police department. She was then shot.

The woman died at the scene. A medical examiner will perform an examination and autopsy. Her identity is not being released at this time.

No Lynchburg officers were hurt.

Per Lynchburg Police Department policy, the involved officer has been placed on administrative leave with pay.

Virginia State Police is handling the investigation.
