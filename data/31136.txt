The two-month-old case of Jim Rogers, who died after being tasered by Pittsburgh police, is bringing new comments from authorities.Allegheny County Police, the Allegheny County Medical Examiners Office, and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto are responding to statements released by Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala.Allegheny County Communications Director Amie Downs told Pittsburgh's Action News 4 via email:"The Allegheny County Police Department has turned over all information it currently has on this case and confirmed with the District Attorney's office investigators as recently as this morning that nothing else is outstanding.""The cause and manner of death for Mr. Rogers is pending as the medical examiner's office is awaiting the results of testing. That status has already been conveyed by the medical examiner's office to investigators and the district attorney's office."The account provided by Downs followed a statement released by the district attorney, saying he's still waiting for evidence from the city, county and medical examiner.In an emailed statement to Pittsburgh's Action News 4, Zappala said:"We continue to wait for evidence from the city, the county and the medical examiner. Until such time as I can review that evidence, I cannot take a position. However, recognizing the inherent conflict involved in police agencies investigating themselves and each other, I have directed several of my detectives and staff members to work to bring the information surrounding the death of Jim Rogers to a point where I can speak about it to the public. That being said, there are numerous other important issues that have been raised, several of which the Mayor of the City of Pittsburgh could have addressed a long time ago but did not." Peduto says the city is cooperating with county police and the district attorney and conducting an internal investigation as well.In an emailed statement to Pittsburgh's Action News 4, Peduto said:"We have and will continue to cooperate with the Allegheny County Police Department who is in charge of the investigation. In addition, we are running a concurrent internal investigation around any potential policy violations and will share all of that information with the incoming Gainey Administration. We will also fully cooperate as needed with the District Attorney whose job it is to prosecute crimes." It's been two months since Rogers died after he was shocked by a Taser multiple times by Pittsburgh Police in the city's Bloomfield neighborhood. Police said the tasering happened when Rogers was non-compliant during his arrest over an alleged attempted theft of a bicycle. The case has been the subject of ongoing community protests and calls for action.
