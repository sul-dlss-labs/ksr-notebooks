A South Milwaukee police officer fatally shot a man who threatened to kill himself -- and then fired a shot at officers on Monday afternoon, Oct. 19, officials said.

The incident unfolded around 1:20 p.m. on Monday -- when police were dispatched to the neighborhood near 8th Avenue and Blake Avenue. Officials said the man threatening suicide was on a porch and was armed with a handgun. He fired one round at officers -- and one officer returned fire, fatally striking the man on the porch.

"I looked out the window and I saw a police officer on his knee behind a tree with a rifle," said Jim Malek, who lives nearby and watched the incident unfold. "Being a quiet neighborhood, it's just kind of shock. You don't expect anything like that ever."

The incident drew a large law enforcement presence, including the Wisconsin Department of Justice's Crime Scene Response team.

Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm was also at the scene.

"You know, you just worry about everybody involved in the whole situation. It's sad, just a sad situation," said South Milwaukee resident Julie Janikowski.
