The Knoxville Police Department said a 40-year-old woman died Tuesday after crashing a vehicle during a high-speed police chase. Knoxville police said an officer initiated a traffic stop on Highway 14 near Knoxville Middle School after observing a gold Dodge Grand Caravan traveling 41 mph in a 30 mph zone. "One of my officers … attempted to stop a car from speeding in front of the middle school," Knoxville police Chief Dan Losada said. "The vehicle then tried to evade the officer." Police said the driver, Erin Weers, pulled into the ATM lane of a nearby Iowa State Bank but did not stop. The driver then turned south and west without stopping at a stop sign or red light. Weers accelerated to speeds that at times exceeded 90 mph along Highway 14, eventually entering a ditch and hitting the driveway to 1165 N. Highway 14. Police said the impact launched the vehicle into the air, causing it to crash back into the ditch and catch fire. Authorities extinguished the fire and found Weers partially ejected from the vehicle. She was pronounced dead at the scene.Losada said Weers was not wanted by police and nothing illegal was found in the vehicle. Police continue to investigate why she evaded authorities rather than stopping when caught speeding in the school zone. "At this time, we don't know why she fled," Losada said. "It is something we'd like to know." Losada said his heart goes out to Weers' family and he is relieved the high-speed chase, which began as school let out, did not end more tragically. Police said a blood test is being be done to determine whether Weers had anything in her system. The Marion County Sheriff's Office, Iowa State Patrol, Iowa Department of Transportation, Knoxville Rural Fire Department and Knoxville Fire Rescue assisted Knoxville police with the investigation, which is ongoing.
