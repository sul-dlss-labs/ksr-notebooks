Chandler police have confirmed that the man who allegedly started a fire at a Super 8 on Friday and shot a passing car, 37-year-old Nathan Daniel Griffis, died Saturday after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound Friday.

Police say just before 11:30 a.m. they responded to a fire at the motel near 56th Street and Chandler Boulevard. Witnesses told police that they believed Griffis was responsible for starting the fire; he was seen leaving the area.

Griffis reportedly fled from officers as they arrived and ran into the Holsom Bakery near 54th Street and Chandler Boulevard.

Police say Griffis ordered the employees leave the bakery; he was seen with a handgun.

Officers were able to establish a perimeter and contained Griffis inside the bakery.

He was later found to have suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Griffis was rushed to the hospital where he died Saturday morning.

Police say it was later determined that Griffis had pointed his gun at several people outside the motel and had also fired several rounds while fleeing. One of the rounds struck a passing car, according to investigators.

It's unclear how many rounds were fired or if Griffis was intentionally shooting at people as he fled, police said.

Police say no injuries were reported at either scenes.

Griffis was also being investigated by Mesa police for arson, theft and burglary charges.
