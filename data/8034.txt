Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 8710 Fondren April 21, 2009 - A suspect armed with a machete and large knife was fatally shot when he attempted to attack Houston police officers at 8710 Fondren about 7:20 p.m. on Monday (April 20). The suspect, Jose Alexi Sorto (H/m, DOB: 5-29-79), was pronounced dead at the scene. Officer X.A. Flores, who discharged his weapon at the suspect, was not injured. Officer Flores, assigned to the Fondren Patrol Division, was sworn in as an officer in February 2008. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant C.M. Cegielski and Officer J.T. Barringer reported: The suspect’s wife called police because the suspect was intoxicated, became violent and had struck two of his children with a belt. He also struck one of the children in the mouth with his hand, causing the child’s mouth to bleed. Officers responding to the call were told by a dispatcher the suspect was armed with a machete and a large knife. Officers located the suspect’s wife in an apartment. She told officers the suspect was standing outside the back door of the apartment. The officers saw the suspect standing outside the back door, leaning on a parked vehicle. Officers gave verbal commands to the suspect in English and Spanish to get on the ground. At that time, the suspect ignored the commands, grabbed the machete and knife from the hood of the parked vehicle and aggressively approached the officers with the machete raised. Officer Flores, fearing for his safety, discharged his duty weapon, striking the suspect. Paramedics were immediately called and pronounced the suspect deceased. As is customary in HPD officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
