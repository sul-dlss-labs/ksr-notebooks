Authorities say a former Colorado town employee who was on the run took his own life over the weekend during a traffic stop in Phoenix.

Ronald James Braden, 55, was arrested on July 4 following an 18-month investigation related to theft of public funds, according to a Facebook post from the Vail Police Department in Colorado.

Details about the events leading up the investigation were not provided. However, the department said Braden was a former Information Technology director for the Town of Vail and ultimately charged on suspicion of embezzlement of public property, theft, forgery and assault on a peace officer.

On Nov. 13, more than a month after being released from jail on bond, Braden cut off a GPS monitoring device issued to him and eventually fled to Maricopa County, according to the department.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office stopped a car on the morning of Nov. 21 near Tatum Boulevard and Pinnacle Peak Road because officers suspected Braden and a homeowner possibly providing shelter him were in it, a news release from the sheriff's office said.

At some juncture, Braden shot and killed himself, the news release said.

Investigations into Braden's death and flee from Colorado were ongoing. Police did not release details about the other person involved in the traffic stop.

It's unclear how long Braden was employed with the Town of Vail. He resigned following a separate 2018 arrest on suspicion of soliciting a minor for prostitution, according to the Vail Police Department.
