A Wahiawa man was killed in a crash that also injured two other people outside Schofield Barracks this morning after the car he was in sped away from a police vehicle following an attempt to serve a drug search warrant.

The crash took place on Kunia Road fronting Schofield’s Foote Gate about 7:10 a.m.

Police said the 39-year-old man who was killed was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a 29-year-old man. The car, a gray 1990 Honda, was speeding on Kunia Road when it ran the red light at Foote Gate and hit a white Camry driven by a 58-year-old woman who was turning into Schofield Barracks, according to police.

After the initial collision, the Honda hit a metal traffic signal pole and split in two. The 39-year-old passenger was ejected from the car and died at the scene.

The Department of Medical Examiner identified the man as Michael Daraban Jr., 39, of Wahiawa.

The drivers of both cars were seriously injured, police said. The woman’s status was upgraded to good condition later in the day.
