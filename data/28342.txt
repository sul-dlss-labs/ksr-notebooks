KETTERING, Ohio (AP) — A man who refused orders to drop a gun and fired at officers responding to a domestic violence call has been shot and killed, an Ohio police chief said Monday.

The shooting occurred Sunday night in the Dayton suburb of Kettering. Kettering police are conducting their own investigation into the fatal shooting of man identified as James Tober Sr., Chief Christopher Protsman said.

Protsman said Monday that, based on a preliminary investigation, the two officers who fired their weapons acted properly, The Dayton Daily News reported.

According to Protsman, gunfire can be heard in the background of a 911 call from Tober’s wife, who said Tober was having mental issues.

Tober stood in the street holding a gun when officers approached, Protsman said, leading to an exchange of gunfire. Officers can be heard ordering Tober to drop his weapon on the audio portion of dash camera footage, Protsman said.

Neighbors told the newspaper that Tober was a quiet man who kept to himself and liked to ride motorcycles.
