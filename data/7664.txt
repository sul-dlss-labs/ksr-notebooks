FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — Callers to 911 reported shots fired in the area of Post Avenue in Fayetteville before police arrived on the scene where a suspect was shot Thanksgiving night.







911 calls released Tuesday indicate neighbors were concerned after hearing multiple shots in the vicinity of Post Avenue and Hawkins Street.







Police radio traffic, also released Tuesday, contains reports from multiple officers, ending with an urgent call for medics. "A black male is down in the middle of Post Avenue," an officer reports, asking that medics hurry to the scene.







That man, Kenmara Davis, was shot by Officer Michael Yount. Davis, 26, was pronounced dead at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center.







Yount, sent to investigate the shots, found Davis stumbling in the street, officials said.







"He began to question the suspect. The gentleman pulled out a gun and fired shots, to which the officer in self-defense fired back,” police spokeswoman Theresa Chance said.







Neighbors said Davis was running down the street from the officer when he was shot.







Davis' sister, Larana Davis, questioned the police version of events. “My brother was murdered, you know what I mean. And he did nothing. He did nothing,” she said.







Yount has been placed on administrative duty while the State Bureau of Investigation investigates. Both moves are standard procedure in any officer-involved shooting.
