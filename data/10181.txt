SAN BERNARDINO >> San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office announced Thursday it determined that the 2011 shooting death by a Fontana police officer was justified.

In 2011, Fontana police Officer Jason Pernicairo shot and killed the driver of a reported stolen car whom he believed was trying to run him down in order to escape arrest.

According to the report, Pernicairo was assisting on May 14, 2011 in the arrest of a man driving a stolen car by blocking his path of escape with his patrol car.

Pernicairo said during the investigation the driver of the vehicle, Mahanad Shalabi, 41, tried to ram him with the stolen car, the report read.

After Pernicairo jumped from the path of the car, he opened fire into the car striking Shalabi near the intersection of Palmetto and Marygold avenues.

Shalabi crashed the car into a nearby home. He died from a single gunshot wound to the head, according to the report.

Independent eyewitness reports corroborated the statements offered by police during the investigation.

“Officer Pernicairo believed that an assault with deadly force, a stolen vehicle, was about to be committed against him and others in the immediate area,” the report said. “Under these circumstances Officer Pernicairo used reasonable force to affect an arrest, and he acted in self-defense and in the defense of others.”
