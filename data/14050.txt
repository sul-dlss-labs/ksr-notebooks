The man shot by police in north Omaha Wednesday evening died soon after arriving at a local hospital, Omaha Police Chief Thomas Warren said Thursday.

Twenty-year-old Robert Ventry died at 7:19 p.m. Wednesday, less than an hour after police were alerted to a man barging into homes on the 4000 block of Camden Avenue.

Police and rescue crews responded to at least five 911 calls of a man banging on windows and trying to break into homes on the 4000 block of Camden Avenue between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m., police said. Residents told authorities that the man was calling for help.

Warren said Thursday the man, identified as Ventry, was described as being “delusional.”

In one home, police said, Ventry assaulted a resident, then laid on the floor and tore off his clothes. The resident was later treated at a hospital and released.

Officers confronted Ventry in yet another house. Warren said four officers entered the residence and found Ventry in the kitchen wielding a knife in his right hand and lunging at a female resident. Officer Jerry Kassen shot Ventry on the right side of his chest to prevent him from hurting the woman, the police chief said.

Despite being critically injured, Ventry continued to struggle with police, and another officer used a Taser on him, Warren said.

“His behavior was very aggressive, erratic and violent,” said Warren, also noting that those were signs of someone under the influence of the street drug phencyclidine, commonly called PCP.

Ventry’s other behaviors — such as tearing off his clothes and not responding to a Taser shock — are also signs, Warren said.

The chief said Ventry had a history of drug use. An autopsy will be conducted to determine whether he was, indeed, under the influence of drugs.

Warren said Kassen, a four-year veteran of the department, has been placed on administrative duty.

An internal investigation will be conducted to ensure Kassen’s action was justified, the police chief said. A grand jury will also investigate.
