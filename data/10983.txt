Dubuque standoff ends after man shoots himself

A weekend standoff at a home in Dubuque ended with the death of a wanted man. Dubuque Police say the man, wanted by authorities on five outstanding warrants, was located at his home around 5:30 p.m. Saturday.

Officers said the man tried to flee, but noticed his home was surrounded and locked himself inside. Neighbors were evacuated as a precaution as it was believed the subject had access to weapons.

After failing to establish contact with the man for over six hours, police deployed tear gas into the home. Officers entered the home at 12:45 a.m. and found the man dead from an apparent self inflicted gun shot wound.

Police have now identified the man as Blaine Wright, 22, of Dubuque. He was wanted as an escapee from a Dubuque Correctional Facility and also had four probation violation warrants. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating the incident.
