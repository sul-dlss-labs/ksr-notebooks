Police said officers responded to a 911 call about shots being fired at the location. When they arrived, police said they encountered a man who fit the description of a suspect holding a gun.

Kelly said a witness told police "the individual fired at police officers," but Kelly said "we're still trying to confirm that."

The suspect then ran off and the witness said "he fires at the police officers again," Kelly said, adding that no ballistic evidence was found in that area.

"The individual runs to a third location. During his flight, officers are firing shots," Kelly said. "A total of 17 shots were fired by six police officers who responded."

The suspect was killed, police said. A .45-caliber handgun was found near the suspect's body and four shell casings from a .45 were recovered at the scene, Kelly said. The suspect was also wearing a holster, Kelly said.

The investigation is ongoing.
