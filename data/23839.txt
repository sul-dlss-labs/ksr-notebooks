PIMA COUNTY, AZ (Tucson News Now) - The Pima County Sheriff's Department said the woman fatally shot by a deputy last week had a extensive criminal history and an active felony warrant.

The PCSD said Amanda Alvarez, 38, was shot inside a trailer in the 4700 block of West Camino Tierra on Saturday, March 3.

"As the deputies were clearing the trailer, Alvarez attacked them both utilizing Counter AssaultÂ® Bear Deterrent, a form of Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray intended for use only on bears," the PCSD said in a news release. "Alvarez was shot following this attack."
