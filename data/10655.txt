Auxiliary Trooper Kills Naked Home Invader Armed With Bow And Arrow

An auxiliary Florida Highway Patrol trooper shot and killed her neighbor, who was naked and armed with a bow and arrow, after a home invasion Monday night in Escambia County.

Sean Harris, 24, of the 4200 block of Lynn Ora Drive, was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital where he died around 9:45 p.m.

Auxiliary Trooper Tabbatha Nussbaumer was in the shower in her upstairs bedroom in the Scenic Heights neighborhood area when her her 9-year-old son ran in and told her a man he didn’t recognize was in the house. Nussbaumer exited her room and was confronted by Harris, who was at the bottom of the stairs holding a bow and arrow.

Nussbaumer told Pensacola Police that Harris asked her where the money was located. In an effort to get the suspect out of her house and away from her son, she told him it was in her truck parked on the street. As she exited the front door, Harris followed, removed his clothes and approached her as she was at her vehicle, which was parked in the street.

Police said Nussbaumer removed a handgun from the truck, turned around and faced Harris, who was standing a few feet from her. She said that as Harris advanced toward her, she fired one shot.

When police arrived, Harris was found lying nude in the street. He had been shot once in the lower abdomen.

Court documents indicated that his mother told police that Harris might be on drugs, and that he told the ambulance crew that he had used cocaine.

The Pensacola Police Department has asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to handle the investigation into the shooting.

“The FDLE has agreed to this request,” said Chief Chip W. Simmons. “We believe that under the circumstances, it was appropriate for FDLE to conduct the investigation because Tabbatha Nussbaumer is a former Pensacola Police officer.”
