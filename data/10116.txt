Jose Solorio, a 46-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by police Wednesday, April 27, in the 1700 block of East 115th Street in Watts, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Patrol officers responded to a “neighbor dispute, possible shots fired” call about 8:20 a.m., according to an LAPD news release.

When they arrived, the officers met with a resident who told them that he had had an argument with his neighbor, Jose Solorio. The resident thought Solorio had fired a shot at his house, police said. He also told them that he had heard arguing from inside Solorio’s house and possibly additional shots fired inside.

The officers then went and knocked on Solorio 's door and were let inside the home by one of its occupants. They were told that Solorio was in the back.

As the police walked to the rear of the home, they were confronted by Solorio, who was armed with a shotgun and a knife, authorities said.

According to police, Solorio refused to respond to the officer’s commands to drop the weapons, and then pointed the shotgun at them. At that point, an office-involved shooting occurred.

Solorio was struck twice in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene.

No officers were injured. A loaded, single-barrel shotgun was recovered inside the home.

LAPD Force Investigation Division personnel are investigating the officer-involved shooting.
