CLEARWATER â€” A woman was killed early Wednesday after the driver of a sport utility vehicle in which she was as passenger fled a traffic stop and crashed into a building, Clearwater police said.

The crash happened about midnight near the intersection of Chestnut Street and Prospect Avenue. Police said an officer had tried to make a traffic stop of a 2002 Suzuki sport utility vehicle about a half-mile away at S Missouri Avenue and Court Street before the driver, Pedro Castro, 36, of Tampa, fled.

Police say Castro made a U-turn on Court Street and the officer did not pursue. Where Chestnut and Court streets meet, the SUV continued west on Chestnut against one-way traffic. To avoid a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle, Castro swerved and crashed into a nearby building, police said.

The passenger of the SUV, identified as 28-year-old Sasha Marie Hudtwalcker-Grey, was killed at the scene. Castro was taken to Bayfront Health St. Petersburg. His condition was not released by police.

Police said Castro will face charges of vehicular homicide, driving with a license suspended or revoked causing death and fleeing to elude causing death.
