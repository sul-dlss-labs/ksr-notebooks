Terence Leslie, 32, was stopped about 2:20 a.m. at an Exxon gas station on Camp Creek Parkway in East Point, GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said.

The officer was conducting a field sobriety test on Leslie when he began to fight with the officer, she said.

During the altercation, the officer deployed his Taser. Leslie grabbed at the Taser and broke the officer’s arm, Miles said.

“The officer fired multiple gunshots at Leslie, striking him,” she said.

Leslie got back in his vehicle and drove a short distance before he crashed into a pole at another gas station.

The officer and Leslie were taken to hospitals, and Leslie died from his injuries, Miles said. The officer, who was not identified, was treated and is recovering.

The GBI is investigating, which is normal for shootings involving police.
