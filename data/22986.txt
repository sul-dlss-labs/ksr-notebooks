In a press conference Saturday morning, Syracuse Police Chief, Frank Fowler says Eric Dempsey, 39, was involved in a police chase that ultimately resulted in the death of two other men.

Shortly before 7 p.m. Friday night, Dempsey was stopped for a traffic violation when he sped off towards West Onondaga.

He turned onto Midland Avenue with police lights and sirens on his tail. When he reached Lincoln Avenue, he sped through a stop sign crashing into a vehicle traveling on Tallman Street, which does not have a stop sign.

The vehicle traveling on Tallman was carrying a 49-year-old man and a 24-year-old man.

The 49-year-old died at the scene, but was transported to a hospital.

The 24-year-old died at the hospital.

Dempsey was taken to the hospital and was treated for minor injuries, and shortly after he was taken to the Justice Center.

He is currently being charged with two counts of Vehicular Manslaughter, second degree, two counts of Manslaughter, second degree, unlawful fleeing of a police officer, DWI, as well as many other vehicle infractions.

Dempsey was arraigned Saturday morning.
