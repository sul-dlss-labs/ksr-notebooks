NEWARK -- A routine traffic stop in Union Township late Saturday night turned into a police chase that ended when the fleeing suspect crashed into another car in Newark and died this morning, authorities said.

A woman driving the other car, along with her young daughter in the back seat, were both injured in the accident, said Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for Essex County Prosecutor Paula Dow.

The suspect, Leray Herring, 37, of Newark, died around 4 a.m. at University Hospital, following the crash, which happened on Martin Luther King Boulevard and Clinton Street, Loriquet said.

The injured driver, 35 of Elizabeth and her 6-year-old daughter, were listed in satisfactory condition, Loriquet said.

The incident started when Union Township Police attempted to stop Herring in his Honda Accord, just before midnight, authorities said. He accelerated away and police followed him into Newark. He crashed minutes later, Loriquet said.

The exact reason for the original traffic stop was not known, nor was the reason Herring chose to flee, Loriquet said.

The prosecutor's office vehicle homicide unit and professional standards unit were investigating. Loriquet said both were standard procedure for this kind of incident.
