Albany County sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a man Sunday at a ski resort after he allegedly charged at law enforcement with a knife, according to a Monday news release from the sheriff.

Colorado man John Alan Britton, 48, died at Snowy Range Ski Area after an encounter with deputies.

Deputies and emergency personnel tried lifesaving measures, but Britton succumbed to his injuries at the scene, the news release stated.

The sheriff’s office called in the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate the shooting, as is typical after officer-involved shootings.

At the conclusion of DCI’s investigation, a report will be sent to the Albany County prosecuting attorney for review.

According to the news release, deputies Matt Donnell, Edward Rosier, Aaron Gallegos and Adam Dean were placed on administrative leave pending the conclusion of the investigation, which is also procedural following officer-involved shootings.

Deputies received a report Sunday of a suicidal man and, after an extensive search, found Britton in his truck in the upper parking lot of the ski resort.

Britton refused to exit his truck and deputies placed the ski area on lockdown. Skiers were asked to remain inside ski area buildings and the Centennial Fire Department EMS waited at the entrance to the ski area.

Britton eventually exited his truck and walked toward deputies. Deputies tried to end the situation peacefully, but Britton, armed with a knife, suddenly charged the deputies, the news release stated.

An autopsy was set for Monday morning in Loveland, Colorado.

The incident is the sixth officer-involved shooting in Wyoming so far this year. Officers have shot and killed suspects in Campbell and Converse counties and the cities of Casper and Cheyenne. A pregnant woman was shot in the leg on Interstate 25 near Glenrock, and survived her injuries.
