Dallas police are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting in the 10700 block of Eastham Drive in Pleasant Grove.[[429521563,R]]

Police said they were called to an active shooter call just before 5 p.m.



Officers approached the home, where the front door was standing open. Officers could hear a loud disturbance inside the home between a man and a woman. They could also hear an infant crying.

The officers commanded the man to come to the door. When he did, officers say he was holding a handgun. Investigators say that left the officer no choice but to open fire, striking the 28-year-old white male. He was taken to the hospital where he later died.

The woman inside the home was also taken to the hospital for treatment of what police described as "significant lacerations" but is expected to be OK. The infant was not hurt, police said.

Investigators say it appears the man may have assaulted the woman and threatened to kill her and the infant.

Identities of the people involved have not been released.
