A baseball bat-wielding man charging San Bernardino police officers has been shot to death.

The Riverside Press-Enterprise ( https://bit.ly/QVigIZ ) says two officers responding to a Wednesday night emergency call found two assault victims and a 54-year-old man holding an aluminum baseball bat.

Investigators say Dennis Allen Clore, who was in the detached garage of a home, was ordered several times to drop the bat.

But the man refused and he raised the bat and charged the officers.

Clore was shot several times and killed.

The San Bernardino County district attorneyâ€™s office will determine if the shooting was justified.
