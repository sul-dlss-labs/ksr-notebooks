A woman killed in a crash in San Francisco’s Bayview District while allegedly fleeing from the California Highway Patrol Thursday afternoon has been identified, according to the San Francisco medical examiner’s office.

Latima Wright, 30, of San Francisco, was pronounced dead at San Francisco General Hospital after a crash shortly after 3 p.m. in the 100 block of Barneveld Avenue.

The crash stemmed from an earlier incident when CHP officers tried to pull over two women, with Wright in the driver’s seat, in a 1991 Honda Accord and directed them to get off U.S. Highway 101 at the Cesar Chavez Street off-ramp around 3 p.m., CHP Officer Michael Ferguson said.

The officers directed the women to take a right at Jerrold Avenue and they stopped at a Chevron station at Bayshore Boulevard and Jerrold Avenue, Ferguson said.

After checking the car’s license plates, the officers realized it had been reported stolen and ordered the women out of the car, Ferguson said.

But Wright allegedly put the car into reverse and rammed the CHP car several times and drove off, Ferguson said.

The CHP officers did not find the car until after it crashed nearby on Barneveld Avenue.

San Francisco police said that the driver and passenger were both taken to San Francisco General Hospital but Wright had succumbed to her injuries by the time they arrived.

The passenger, a 29-year-old woman, remains hospitalized with life-threatening injuries, according to police.
