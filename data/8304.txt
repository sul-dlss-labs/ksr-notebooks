Jose Jimenez, a 16-year-old white youth, was shot to death by a police officer at Meeker Avenue and Mildred Street in El Monte on July 24, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

The events that led to Jimenez's shooting began shortly before 4:30 a.m. when Baldwin Park officers followed a vehicle that had been reported stolen

The officers stopped the vehicle, and two people described as "male Hispanic adult passengers" got out and ran, according to the Sheriff's Department, which is investigating the shooting. The female driver remained and was taken into custody.

One of the officers, who was not identified, chased the two. He told sheriff's investigators that he opened fire when one of the suspects reached for a gun. Jimenez, who lived in La Puente, did not fire any shots; the officer fired four, investigators said.

A handgun was recovered at the scene where Jimenez died, authorities said. The second suspect remained at large Friday night. Coroner's officials listed Jimenez's race as Caucasian in their report.
