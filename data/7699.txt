Responding to a fight that he believed involved a loaded weapon, a police officer fatally shot a 40-year-old man in the hallway of the manâ€™s Bronx apartment building late Tuesday after the man confronted officers with a baseball bat, the Police Department said on Wednesday.

Officers went to the building at 2710 Bainbridge Avenue in the Bedford Park neighborhood just before midnight on Tuesday after a call from someone in the building who reported a dispute with a gun, the police said.

Because the officers believed that a gun was involved, they were on heightened alert. At least one officer, the first to reach the scene, wore a bullet-resistant vest and had his weapon drawn, said Paul J. Browne, the chief police spokesman.

But instead of a gunman, the officers found an unruly crowd, including a man with a wooden bat who refused an order to put it down, the police said.
