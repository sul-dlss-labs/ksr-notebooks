FREMONT — A 54-year-old man whom two police officers shot last month as he wielded a knife has died from his gunshot wounds, a police spokeswoman said Friday.

Troy Francis was wounded in a July 20 shooting, when officers struck him with gunfire as they responded to reports of a household disturbance.

The officers involved in the fatal shooting, Timothy Ferrara and Marrkel Smith, initially were put on paid administrative leave but both have since returned to work, spokeswoman Geneva Bosques said.

Ferrara, a 10-year Fremont police veteran, was involved in a similar fatal shooting in 2010, when he and two other officers were responding to a domestic disturbance when they shot and killed Juan Mosso, a man they said was armed with a knife.

Mosso’s family filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Fremont nearly a year after the shooting, but the courts ruled in favor of the city and police, said attorney Edwin Bradley, who represented the plaintiffs.

Last month, Ferrara and Smith arrived at a home in the 4700 block of Baffin Avenue after a female caller told police that Francis had held a knife as he threatened and chased her and another female roommate.

Ferrara and Smith, a six-year veteran, found Francis armed with a large knife in the front yard, Bosques said. Police said the officers “gave numerous commands” for him to drop the knife, but he did not. Police said Francis raised the knife and charged at the officers, and they fired gunshots that struck the man.

Other officers arrived and gave medical aid to Francis, who was taken to a trauma center and underwent emergency surgery, police said.

He remained in a hospital for nearly a month until he was released to his family’s care earlier this week.
