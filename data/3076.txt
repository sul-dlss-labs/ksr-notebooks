The chase ended in a barbed wire fence, but began miles down the road, with a Fyffe police patrol on Highway 75. Officers noticed a motorcycle going North, way over 55 miles an hour.

"I think it's great that they got a four lane most of the way," Rainsville resident Ricky Stone says. "But it has picked up on traffic and speeders."

When the patrol car turned around, the bike did not heed it's blue lights, instead leading police all the way into and through town, pulling over just past Jack's restaurant.

"Be honest, it happens a lot here on Sand Mountain," Stone explains. "You hear all the time about somebody either running from the law. It's getting where it's a regular thing around here, unfortunately."

When police approached the motorcycle, they say it bolted once again, further up 75 into the small town of Shiloh, where Rainsville police joined the chase. Soon after, the motorcycle made a U-turn, finally ending up behind Wilson funeral home, caught up in the barbed wire fence.

"You always get caught," Stone says.

When police arrested the driver, they say he was having trouble breathing. A short ambulance ride could not save him, and he later died at Baptist Dekalb Medical Center.
