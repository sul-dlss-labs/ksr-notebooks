JACKSON COUNTY, Alabama - A suspect in burglary and drug cases who eluded Jackson County deputies several times in recent weeks is in critical condition this morning after he shot himself in the head Wednesday during a standoff with authorities, the sheriff said.

Jackson County Sheriff Chuck Phillips said the incident began Wednesday night when Deputy Travis Renfro spotted a 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier that was reported stolen earlier in the day from a home in the Rosalie community.

When Renfro attempted to stop the car as it traveled along Alabama Highway 71, the driver, later identified at Jerome Lamar Wright, 22, of Rosalie, fled.

"A short chase ensued after which the vehicle stopped due to engine problems on Highway 71 near County Road 345 in Rosalie," Phillips said. Wright had led deputies on several other chases recently and eluded capture, the sheriff said.

Renfro approached the car and saw that Wright was seated inside holding a rifle to his head.

"Deputy Renfro retreated to cover and requested backup from other deputies and investigators, who were called out to assist," the sheriff said. An ambulance also was called to wait nearby. "During the approximately four-hour standoff numerous attempts were made by investigators and family members to talk Wright into surrendering."

However, Wright shot himself in the head. The waiting ambulance from Highlands Medical Center responded quickly and transported Wright to a landing zone where he was transferred to an Air Evac Helicopter and transported to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga.

Wright was wanted on arrest warrants from Jackson County on charges including third-degree burglary, theft of property, possession of controlled substances, possession of drug paraphernalia, criminal mischief and harassment.
