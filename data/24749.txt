GWINNETT COUNTY, Ga. — A Gwinnett County neighborhood is returning to normal after a daylong standoff ended with a man taking his own life.

Police swarmed the area around a home along Williamsburg Lane near Norcross.

Investigators told Channel 2's Nefertiti Jaquez the situation started with a man firing a gun.

Gwinnett County police and SWAT investigators have been at the home since about 9 a.m. Thursday.

Police told Jaquez that they were called to the home by neighbors who said the homeowner, who they referred to as Tony, was firing shots in his front yard.

Officers said the man went back into the home, where he rents a room, and was not seen afterward.

Minutes after the 911 call came in, police descended on the home. Officers evacuated the remaining people inside the house, and put other neighbors on alert.

Around 3:30 p.m., police said they issued what they call a full SWAT activation in an attempt to get the man out of the home.

“Officers have attempted contact with the subject inside. Haven’t been able to make contact with him on any of the numbers that we have called, in trying to get him to come out,” said Cpl. Wilbert Rundles, with the Gwinnett County Police Department.

Shortly after Jaquez arrived at the scene, she heard officers using bullhorns to help get the man to surrender.

She then said police sent in a robot to check out the home.

Investigators said in a news release Thursday night that when they were finally able to get into the home, they discovered the man dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.

They are not releasing the man's identity, pending notification of his family.
