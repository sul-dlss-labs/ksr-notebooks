The man shot to death when police said he charged at them was identified Wednesday, Dec. 12, as Lucas Hodson, 38, of Moreno Valley.

Police and firefighters responded to a 911 call at a home in the 14000 block of Perris Boulevard about 6:20 p.m., Sunday, Dec. 9, Riverside County sheriff’s officials said in a news release. The caller hung up before dispatchers could determine the nature of the call, the release said.

Authorities tried to reach someone inside several times, but got no answer. Firefighters and police forced their way into the apartment when they heard noise inside and feared a medical emergency, sheriff’s officials said.

Inside the home, one police officer found Hodson sitting on the couch with a metal object in his hands, which officers thought was a weapon. Police have not described the object.

Police ordered Hodson to drop the object, but he refused and ran into another room. As the officer ran out of the home, Hodson returned to the living room and started charging toward the officer with the weapon, the Sheriff’s Department said.

A person with the same name was ordered in July to attend an anger-management class after he was convicted of contempt of court, online Superior Court records show. The charge appeared to be related to a court order in a domestic violence case.

In June, Hodson was convicted of misdemeanor vandalism.

In April, a judge granted a three-year restraining order against Hodson because of domestic violence.
