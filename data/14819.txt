SPANISH FORT, Alabama -- Mobile County Constable Larry Lambert Sheffield was arrested Sunday and charged with murder after police say he shot someone in the parking lot of Traders club.

Spanish Fort Police Chief David Edgar said shortly after 12 a.m. Sunday police received a call that a person had been shot in the parking lot of Traders on the Causeway in Spanish Fort.

When officers arrived they found 52-year-old Jeffrey Carter McMillan dead in the parking lot of Traders.

Edgar said the suspected shooter remained on scene and was identified as 68-year-old Larry Lambert Sheffield of Semmes. Sheffield identified himself as a Mobile County Constable.

After further investigation, Edgar said the incident started inside of Traders, but police received conflicting reports on if the altercation began as verbal or physical.

The altercation, according to Edgar, spilled outside and into the Traders parking lot and continued as a physical altercation.

Sheffield, according to Edgar, produced a semi-automatic handgun and fired one round at close range, striking McMillan in the head.

Edgar said there were three or four bystanders in the parking lot at the time of the incident, and about 20 people inside of Traders.

Sheffield was arrested and charged with murder, and was transported to the Baldwin County jail, according to Edgar. Jail records show Sheffield was booked at 2:27 p.m. Sunday.

Baldwin County Corrections Center records show Sheffield was booked in jail in July of 1999, and Edgar confirmed this. However, the charges are unknown.

The Mobile County Constables Association website shows Larry L Sheffield served Precinct 24.
