An Iowa motorcyclist died when he crashed after reportedly failing to stop for police.

A report from Iowa State Police said an Iowa County deputy tried to stop a motorcycle for speeding just before 2 a.m. Thursday, September 5, 2013 on Highway 149 at the Iowa – Keokuk county line.

Instead of stopping, police said the motorcycle “accelerated away from the deputy.”

The motorcycle reportedly went around a curve and into gravel where the driver lost control. The driver was thrown from the motorcycle when it went into a ditch and overturned.
