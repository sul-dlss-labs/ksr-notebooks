A San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office review found police officers were legally justified in shooting a 48-year-old San Bernardino burglary suspect who grabbed a stun gun and baton and tried to take an officer’s gun during a scuffle in October 2014.

The confrontation occurred outside the Economy Inn in downtown San Bernardino after a motel customer reported at 2 a.m. that a suspicious man was making threats and trying to break into her room at G and Sixth streets, police said at the time.

When an officer arrived at the motel parking lot to investigate, he found an agitated Carl Gerard Blossomgame, who did not comply with the officer’s commands, threatened to kill the first officer on the scene and was not deterred when officers deployed stun guns and used a baton on him, according to the District Attorney’s Office written statement.

Blossomgame used his feet and hands to fight them off, grabbed a stun gun and baton from different officers and attempted to remove an officer’s gun from its holster.

After hearing one officer say, “He’s going for my gun,” and seeing a black object in the suspect’s hand, other officers thought the object was a gun and fatally shot Blossomgame, according to the written statement.

“All three officers were entitled to use deadly force against Mr. Blossomgame because they had probable cause to believe that Mr. Blossomgame posed a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to themselves and fellow officers,” the statement said.

The officers involved in the incident were identified as Reuben Cordoba, Devon Reid and Raymond Bonshire, according to the report.

During an autopsy, experts found methamphetamine and amphetamine in Blossomgame’s blood.
