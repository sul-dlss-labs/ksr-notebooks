They stand only 18 inches off the asphalt, their young riders in a tight crouch over the handlebars. These tiny, inexpensive motorcycles -- known as pocket bikes -- have begun swarming over New York City streets this summer like buzzing gnats, sometimes in packs and at speeds up to 45 miles per hour.

Meant to resemble high-performance racing motorcycles but built much shoddier, the bikes, made mostly in China, can now be bought at sidewalk discount stores and flea markets for less than $300. But they are illegal to ride on the street, and are favored by teenagers without driver's licenses or helmets -- many of whom say the thrill is avoiding or evading the police.

Early yesterday morning, a teenager died after falling off his brand-new pocket bike while being chased by the police in Queens, the authorities said.

The police said two officers in an unmarked car saw the teenager, Dante Pomar, 19, of Kew Gardens Hills, Queens, riding without a helmet on Main Street about 3 a.m. The officers flashed their dashboard and grille lights to signal Mr. Pomar to pull over, the police said, but he fled onto a side street and tried to lose them by turning down an alleyway. He hit a pothole in the alley, about 15 feet east of 150th Street, fell off the bike and died before medical technicians arrived, the police said.
