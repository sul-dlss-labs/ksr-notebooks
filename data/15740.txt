Del Rio and Val Verde law enforcement were investigating an officer-involved shooting in Del Rio Tuesday.

Val Verde County Justice of the Peace Antonio Faz has released the identity of a man fatally shot by law enforcement in Del Rio Tuesday.

50-year-old Pedro "Pete" Juan Saldivar was killed by officers following a 'disturbance' in Del Rio, initially reported as a 'reckless commercial motor vehicle'.

The shooting took place around 1:30 p.m. on U.S. Highway 90 East and Charles Drive.

KENS 5 Viewer Will Esco provided this video of the shooting incident. Numerous gunshots can be heard in the video, and a large amount of officers can be seen surrounding Saldivar's 18-wheeler truck.

Del Rio Mayor Robert Garza said in a Facebook statement that initial reports indicated that Saldivar was fatally shot by officers at or near a convenience store in the area.

Saldivar, an 18-wheeler driver, reportedly caused a disturbance in a nearby location, threatening individuals with a machete, before attempting to run over several officers with his rig, Garza said in his statement.

The Val Verde County Sheriff, Joe Frank Martinez, and Del Rio Police Chief, Waylon Bullard, said that the incident is still under investigation by their agencies and the Texas Rangers.

Sheriff Martinez and Chief Bullard both confirmed that officers were involved in the shooting, but did not say how many. They said the suspect did die on the scene.

Other details of the story, including the reported machete incident, are still under investigation, according to Sheriff Martinez.
