A Morristown man suspected of driving under the influence died Tuesday night when he crashed a stolen car while being chased by a Hamblen County sheriff's deputy, authorities said.

Michael J. Joyce, 37, died when the Chevrolet Malibu he was driving left the road about 8:40 p.m. and rolled over, "partially ejecting" him so he was "caught between the vehicle and the ground," according to a Tennessee Highway Patrol crash report.

The Malibu had been reported stolen from Joyce's uncle, Robert Joyce, just after 8 p.m., according to Hamblen County Sheriff Esco Jarnagin.

A deputy was still writing the police report when Joyce, driving on the wrong side of the road, nearly struck Deputy Dustin Jordan's cruiser head on, Capt. Hugh Moore said. Jordan gave chase on Kidwell Ridge Road.

Joyce had turned around on Cameron Road and was heading back toward McGinnis Road when he crested a hill, lost control of the car and crashed, Moore said.

He didn't have a seat belt on, and that could have made a difference, THP Trooper Ethan Shultz wrote in the crash report.

Joyce had a lengthy criminal history in Hamblen County: He had been arrested 41 times on charges including DUI, drug possession, assault and theft, Jarnagin and Moore said.

"It's an ongoing thing," the sheriff said, "and tragically, it cost him his life last night. Itâ€™s a terrible thing when someone is killed like that. ... My condolences to the family of the lost."

Due to his "erratic" driving, Jarnagin said he suspects Joyce was under the influence of drugs or alcohol. The toxicology report is not complete.
