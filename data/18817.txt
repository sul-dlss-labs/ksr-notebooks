DELAND - A man was fatally shot Saturday after he reportedly pointed a gun at Lake County sheriff's deputies conducting a well-being check.

The man, Thomas Scott Henry, was taken to a hospital in Deland, the agency reported.

According to Sgt. Fred Jones, sheriffâ€™s spokesman, deputies responded at about 5 p.m. to 32915 Foxfire Lane in Deland after Henry's family said they received emails from him stating "good- bye" and other concerning statements that led them to believe he was suicidal.

When deputies approached the home they looked in the window and spotted Henry slumped in a chair.

He was the only one in the home at the time.

With the door locked, deputies were able to get a key from neighbors and opened the door.

Henry jumped up angrily and picked up a long gun.

Jones added the deputies then retreated off of the porch behind their vehicles, at which time Henry fired several shots out of his window toward neighbors who were standing at the end of the driveway. He then began to shoot out of the front door.

Henry then exited the residence and pointed the weapon toward a deputy at which time he was shot.

No deputies were injured in the incident, but the deputy who shot Henry was placed on administrative leave as sheriff's protocol.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement were called to the scene to investigate.

Thomas Scott Henry would have turned 57 today.
