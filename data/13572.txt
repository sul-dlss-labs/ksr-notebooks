A man who was shot and killed during a police investigation Monday night has been identified as 47-year-old Union City resident Timothy Lopez, according to authorities.

Lopez allegedly wielded a metal pipe and threatened officers during the incident. This incident began when Union City police officers responded to a neighborhood disturbance at 8:30 p.m. on the 4200 block of Saturn Way, near Contempo Park. Arriving officers learned that one of the suspects — identified as Lopez — was on parole and had a warrant for resisting or deterring an officer by use of threat, force or violence, police said.

Officers entered the home and made contact with Lopez. According to police, Lopez was confrontational and refused to comply with officers’ commands. When he threatened the officers with the metal pipe, an officer fired at the suspect.

Lopez was transported to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries, police said. Lopez’s death was the third officer-involved suspect death of 2013 in Union City.
