None â€” WILKINSBURG, Pa. -- Allegheny County detectives are investigating the deaths of two people who crashed in a stolen car being chased by Pittsburgh police into Wilkinsburg.

Police gave chase shortly after midnight Monday when a license plate revealed the car had been stolen at gunpoint in a late February carjacking.

Authorities said Orin Chatman, 19, and Yvonne West, 19, his passenger, were killed in the crash on Penn Avenue about 12:45 a.m. Monday.

The car hit a retaining wall along the road after what police are calling a short chase.

County homicide Sgt. Scott Scherer said officers called off the chase when they realized it was too dangerous, and came upon the wreckage a short time later.

West's family members said Chatman had asked her out several times before she agreed to go out with him.

"I don't understand. I don't understand. I told her not to go. I told her it's a bad idea," said West's sister Morocca Moore-Bey. "She didn't deserve to die like that. Not like that."

Moore-Bey said Chatman picked West up after work on Sunday night.

"He came to McDonald's every single day in that stolen car trying to talk to her. She was dissing him, giving him different numbers. But finally she said, 'He's so cute. I'm going to give him a chance,'" Moore-Bey said.

Police believe Chatman was involved in the Feb. 25 carjacking and another 10 days earlier.
