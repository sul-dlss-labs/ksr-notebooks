Authorities have identified a man who died after being Tasered by police as 61-year-old Jesus Gillard of Detroit.

The Oakland County medical examiner's office tells the Detroit Free Press it is awaiting toxicology results to determine what caused Gillard's death.

Bloomfield Township police said officers tried to pull over an erratically driven van Thursday afternoon in the Detroit suburb. They said the van hit patrol cars as the driver fled before crashing.

Authorities said he got out and assaulted officers, who shot him with a Taser. Police said in a statement the Taser did not stop his "violent behavior."

He became unresponsive after being handcuffed and was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.

The Oakland County Sheriff's Department is investigating the case.
