When the officers tried to enter the bar, they met Donovan Wilson, 19, coming out a side door with a .25-caliber pistol, Mr. Kelly said. “As he pushes the door, he fires to his left  and then he turns and faces the officers. The officers were very close.”

One of the officers shot Mr. Wilson three times, in the elbow and hip, and he dropped his weapon, Mr. Kelly said. Mr. Wilson was listed in stable condition at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center.

As the officers made their way into the bar, Mr. Kelly said, they saw the security guard, Kevin White, pointing a pistol at them.

One of the officers shot Mr. White once in the neck. He was pronounced dead at Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center.

Mr. Kelly said several witnesses later told detectives that the two officers had identified themselves before opening fire. The officers can be seen on a surveillance video from the bar with their badges out, according to law enforcement officials.
