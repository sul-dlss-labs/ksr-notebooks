Police have identified a suspect who died after a confrontation with officers in Phoenix on Thursday evening.

Around 5 p.m., Phoenix Police went to the Sky Harbor Inn near 24th and Van Buren streets to assist Maricopa County Adult Probation with a man who allegedly violated his parole.

According to a police spokesperson, when officers made contact with 27-year-old Michael Cisneros he was armed and a confrontation occurred on the second-floor landing of the building.

Cisneros refused to listen to the officers' commands, officials said. He was shot and later died in the hospital.

Police on Friday said Cisneros had been armed with a non-lethal "replica" pistol at the time of the incident.

Police say Cisneros was on probation for a 2006 case for attempting to commit sexual conduct with a minor along with several other incidents.

No officers were injured during the incident.
