Santa Ana police officers responding to an anonymous report of “two suspicious subjects” shot and killed a Riverside man and arrested another man, authorities said Friday.

Israel Martinez died about 10 p.m. Thursday in a carport in the 600 block of East Walnut Street, authorities said. Juan Antonio Garcia, 21, of Santa Ana surrendered after the shooting and was booked on suspicion of carrying a firearm and being a gang member in possession of drug paraphernalia, police said.

Authorities did not say what triggered the shooting or whether the officers were fired upon.

In a statement released Friday, Sgt. Lorenzo Carrillo said police received a call at 9:47 p.m. Thursday about two suspicious men -- one armed with a handgun.

Two officers discovered Martinez and Garcia in a carport, police said.

The officers shot and wounded Martinez, police said. He died at the scene. Neither of the officers was wounded.

Police recovered a handgun but did not say whom it belonged to. Under California law, suspected gang members can be charged with possessing a firearm even if they do not carry the weapon, but participate in a crime involving a firearm.

The incident is being investigated by the Orange County District Attorney’s office and the Santa Ana Police Department.

Police listed Martinez’s age as 22, but relatives told coroner’s officials he was 18.
