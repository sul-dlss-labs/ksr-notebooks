accident scene

The Lake Charles and Sulphur Police Departments are each mourning the loss of an officer, after an Friday morning accident.

At this point, there are still plenty of questions to be asked, although one thing seems certain: Thursday's stormy weather may have played a part in their deaths.

There is no doubt when looking upon the accident scene that something terribly wrong happened here. From all indications, the vehicle involved in the accident hit a puddle of water at the corner of Common and Madeline, swerved across traffic, jumped the curb and hit this fence surrounding the McNeese Intramural Fields. The vehicle finally came to a rest against the utility pole.

Killed at the scene was the driver of the '97 Chevy truck, 39-year old William Nichols, a patrol officer with the Sulphur Police Department. His passenger, 50-year old Gary Sensat of the Lake Charles Police Department, was a detective with the Cold Case Homicide division. He died later, after being transported to Lake Charles Memorial Hospital.

Lake Charles Police Chief Don Dixon: "Gary was best described as a free spirit. He's one of these guys that could walk into a room and just light up a room. He was funny, he was witty, and had that ability to make you laugh."

Sulphur Police Chief Gary Mullican: "Well, Nich had only been with us for about three years -- a little over three years, actually. He was a very quiet officer, but he was a professional. He was well liked, and we're going to miss him. He was an asset to this department and we're certainly going to miss him. He was a friend."

Funeral services are pending for Nichols, while Sensat's funeral is scheduled for Monday. Lake Charles Police Chief Don Dixon says it doesn't appear as if drugs or alcohol played a part in the accident, but toxicology tests are being performed.
