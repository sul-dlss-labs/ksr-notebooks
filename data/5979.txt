An officer had "unsuccessfully deployed his department-issued Taser in attempts to control Brown," police said.

Police said they were called to Brown's home about 8:20 p.m. Saturday because Brown had beaten his 81-year-old father and 46-year-old brother. Police said they were told Brown had been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.
