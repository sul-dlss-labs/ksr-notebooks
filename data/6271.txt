Joseph Picciano, the 21-year-old Bedford man who was shot and killed after a two-hour police standoff Wednesday evening died of a total of three gunshot wounds, according to Cuyahoga County coroner Elizabeth Balraj.

Bedford police officers shot Picciano in the head, chest, and abdomen after he raised a rifle and pointed it at them about 6:45 p.m. in the 800 block of Lincoln Blvd.

Picciano fired several shots at and near officers during the standoff, which took place in the middle of the street.

Picciano's mother had called police two hours earlier because she thought her son intended to commit suicide, police said.

Picciano then drove away from his Johnson Avenue home with a rifle and police followed him to Lincoln Boulevard, where he got out of his car and exchanged fire with officers.

No one was injured in the initial exchange, and negotiators attempted to talk to Picciano over the next hour, to no avail.
