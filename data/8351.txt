Ezequiel Jacobo, a 33-year-old Latino, was shot several times by L.A. County sheriff's deputies Friday, Aug. 7, in an alley behind an apartment complex in the 23400 block of South Avalon Boulevard in Carson. He died the same day, according to Los Angeles County coroner's officials.

Few details were immediately available about the incident, which occurred about 4 p.m., said sheriff's Sgt. Richard Pena.

Preliminary information suggests that Jacobo was involved in a fight with two or three deputies. One deputy shot him, Pena said.

The names of the deputies involved in the incident have not been released, Pena said. Homicide detectives are investigating the incident, he said.
