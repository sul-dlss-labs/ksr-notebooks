A Macon man was killed Tuesday morning after leading police on a high-speed chase through three counties that ended when he was thrown from his vehicle, the Georgia State Patrol told AJC.com.

The chase began just after 7:50 a.m. when Butts County deputies attempted to pull over a black BMW SUV along I-75 for a tag violation, GSP Sgt. Shaun Browder said.

“As soon as he turned his lights on, the driver fled,” Browder said. “They continued north on 75 at speeds in excess of 100 mph.”

The 44-year-old man, identified as Major Reilford, led police through Butts and Spalding counties and into Henry County, where he crashed less than 10 minutes after the chase began, police said.

Reilford lost control of the SUV just south of I-675, police said. The BMW flipped several times and the man was ejected. Reilford was pronounced dead at the scene.
