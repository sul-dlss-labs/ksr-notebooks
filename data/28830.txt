SAN ANTONIO â€” A woman and five children managed to escape from a west-side apartment as a man barricaded himself inside, San Antonio police said.

Around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, police received a 911 call for a possible burglary at the Westway Apartments in the 5000 block of Culebra Road.

SAPD reported more information about the incident Wednesday morning around 11:50 a.m. They said officers were in the parking lot when they heard a gunshot fired inside the apartment.

Police said the door was open from the inside. The woman and children, ages one to 12, ran out of the apartment. The woman told officers the man inside the apartment had a gun.

According to Police Chief William McManus, when officers got into the apartment, the man barricaded himself inside a bathroom.

The 44-year-old suspect, later identified as Victor Sanchez, was said to be out on bond for Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.

SAPD said one of the officers started talking to the suspect, attempting to get him to drop a handgun he was holding.

The suspect walked further back into the apartment and reportedly told police he had a rifle, and threatened to shoot.

SAPD said the suspect raised his right arm pointing the firearm directly at the officers. That's when six officers fired at the suspect who was struck multiple times.

Authorities said the suspect was taken to University Hospital where he passed away from his injuries.

No officers were shot and all officers involved will be placed on administrative duty per protocol, SAPD said. The SAPD Officer Involved Shooting Team and SAPD Internal Affairs will conduct a criminal and administrative investigation.
