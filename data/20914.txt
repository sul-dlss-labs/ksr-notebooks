A passenger was killed and two others injured Thursday afternoon after a car fleeing Detroit police crashed into a vacant home on the city’s west side.

Officers with a special operations unit spotted a Ford SUV speeding near Manor and Foley about 1:20 p.m. and stopped it, said Sgt. Cassandra Lewis, a spokeswoman for the Detroit Police Department.

When the officers approached, she said, “they observed boxes of ammunition inside the vehicle and the suspects then took off.”

The officers raced back to their car and followed the SUV for about 30 seconds before calling off the pursuit “due to unsafe road conditions,” Lewis said.

The SUV kept going and crashed into a vacant home near Wyoming and Buena Vista, less than a mile away, Lewis said.

A rear-seat passenger was pronounced dead at the scene; the driver and another passenger were taken to a local hospital, Lewis said.

The driver, who had been on a tether, was listed in critical condition Thursday evening, while the passenger was listed as stable, she said.

Police also recovered two firearms from the SUV, Lewis said.

It wasn’t immediately clear when charges would be filed in the incident, she said.
