OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — A former suburban Omaha police officer has been charged in the 2018 shooting death of his girlfriend in which he claimed she shot herself.

Craig Wiech, 54, of Bellevue, turned himself in Tuesday to Omaha authorities on a warrant charging him with tampering with physical evidence in the Aug. 26, 2018, death of 48-year-old Carrie Brown, the Omaha World-Herald reported.

Authorities said physical evidence at the scene indicates that Brown’s body had been moved and manipulated after she was shot but before police arrived at the couple’s Bellevue home. Investigators said they found Brown’s body on the floor of her bedroom and a gun belonging to Wiech under her clenched right fist. But investigators said there was a large pool of blood on the bed, and Brown’s blood was found throughout the house. Engagement and wedding rings given to her by Wiech had been removed from her left hand after the shooting, police said, and while the gun was covered in her blood, her right hand was not.

Wiech was initially arrested at the scene of the killing after becoming combative, taking swings at a firefighter and punching an Omaha police officer. He was charged with two counts of attempted assault and is awaiting trial on those charges.

Wiech had been a Bellevue police officer at the time of the shooting. He was placed on administrative leave until he resigned in February 2019.
