KENTWOOD, Mich., Nov. 27 (AP) - Sheriff's deputies fatally shot a man suspected of killing a pregnant woman and her toddler after the man carjacked two vehicles on Friday and led the police on a high-speed chase through several counties.

The chase ended when the man, Andrew Marcello Osura, 22, crashed a stolen Jeep into a Kent County sheriff's cruiser, got out with a knife and began charging toward officers, officials said. Three deputies fired at Mr. Osura, and he died in the snow.

The chase began after a neighbor of the pregnant woman called 911 to report what sounded like a disturbance in the woman's apartment. When the police responded, they discovered a 2-year-old girl stabbed to death and her 22-year-old mother critically wounded. She died later at a hospital.

The police saw a man fleeing the area and said he carjacked a car in the apartment complex parking lot. After a chase, he crashed, then jumped out and carjacked the Jeep, which was sitting in traffic.
