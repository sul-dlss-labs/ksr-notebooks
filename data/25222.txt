A traffic stop about 100 miles southeast of downtown Atlanta turned deadly Wednesday when a passenger in the vehicle was shot with his own gun, authorities said.

The GBI is investigating after the man, identified as 22-year-old Dequane Rayshun Williams, was killed during a struggle with a Georgia State Patrol trooper in Hancock County.

“The preliminary investigation indicates that no law enforcement officers fired their weapons during the incident and Williams’ wounds are self-inflicted,” GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said in a news release.

Williams first encountered a Hancock County sheriff’s deputy about 6:30 p.m. during a traffic stop on Fairmont Road in Sparta. According to the GBI, Williams exited the vehicle and approached the deputy, who recognized him as a wanted man.

Williams reportedly took off running, followed closely by two deputies and the trooper.

“Williams subsequently pointed a pistol in the direction of one of the deputies,” Miles said. “The GSP trooper made brief physical contact with Williams and shortly thereafter, Williams’ weapon discharged multiple times, striking Williams.”

He died at the scene.

The GBI was called in to help with the death investigation, but Miles said the agency does not consider the incident an officer-involved shooting because the officers never fired. This week, the GBI has opened five other investigations into officer-involved shootings, including one Thursday night that killed a DeKalb County officer and his alleged shooter.

An autopsy on Williams was expected to be performed at the GBI Crime Lab.
