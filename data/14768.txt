RACINE — Officials have identified the man who was killed Sunday afternoon after officers fired at him when he would not drop a weapon.

The man was Rajko Utvic, 37, of Racine, according to a press release from the Racine County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the death.

Two officers from the Racine Police Department responded to an emergency call in the 3000 block of Durand Avenue where they reportedly found Utvic armed with a knife.

Ignoring orders from them to drop the knife, Utvic advanced toward the officers, the release states, and one officer shot and killed him in response.

Utvic was previously found guilty of misdemeanor battery for an incident in July 2011 when he knocked a man to the ground, beat his head against the floor and choked the man over a dispute about the loudness of music, according to court records.

However, neighbors of Utvic at the scene of the shooting Sunday afternoon described him as quiet and gentle man who struggled with mental health issues.

Utvic’s family could not be reached for comment Monday evening.

In the release, Sheriff Christopher Schmaling promised a “thorough and impartial investigation into the shooting” and said the office would forward its findings to the Racine County District Attorney’s Office.
