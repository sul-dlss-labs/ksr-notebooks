Three Madison Police Department officers involved in the fatal shooting of Brent E. Brozek on May 17 have been cleared by the department.

A summary of the Professional Standards and Internal Affairs review, released on Thursday, said Officers Ryan Orvis, Ryan Finnegan and Scott Templeton have been exonerated regarding the department's policies on use of deadly force and use of non-deadly force.

Brozek, 43, was shot and killed May 17 outside his Far East Side condominum when he charged at the officers while carrying a sword.

Brozek had been in a standoff with police earlier in the day when he refused to be evicted out of his foreclosed home.

Eleven rounds were fired at Brozek, with eight hitting him, including a fatal shot to the left side of his neck.

The department's "Deadly Force Authorized" policy reads in part that deadly force can be used if an officer reasonably believes a lesser degree of force would be insufficient:

In the defense of another person who the officer has reasonable cause to believe is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm;

In defense of oneself, where there is reasonable cause to believe one is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.

The summary said the three officers remain on paid leave but will be allowed to transition to their regular duties as they are ready.

Two weeks ago, Dane County District Attorney Ismael Ozanne said the officers will not face criminal charges in the incident.

Police Chief Noble Wray had requested an outside criminal investigation by the Wisconsin Department of Justice into the Brozek shooting, because the police department is reviewing internal policies and procedures following the fatal shooting of Paul Heenan on the Near East Side in November.

Lt. Dan Olivas told Madison.com the district attorney's decision not to press charges in the Brozek shooting was based on the DOJ investigation.
