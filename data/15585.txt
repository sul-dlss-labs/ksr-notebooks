Gary James, General Counsel for the Oklahoma State Trooper Association, released this statement concerning the incident:

"This is the kind of incident that law enforcement faces daily, across the country. Thankfully, this incident took place in front of cameras to avoid any negative controversy law enforcement is having to deal with in their daily duties.

Due to such controversy, Trooper Caleb Swickey made sure to conduct his pat down search in front his vehicle so it would be documented by the dash camera in his patrol car. If not for Swickey's training and abilities we may have had a different outcome.‚Äù
