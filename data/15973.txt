BLUE SPRINGS, Mo. — A teenage driver was killed after fleeing from police in a stolen car during car chase in Blue Springs on Sunday afternoon.

The family of the driver, identified as 17-year-old Marcus Fanning, told FOX 4 that he stole the vehicle overnight, returned home to gather his belongings and told his family he was “going out in style.”

Fanning’s family says that the teen was suffering from depression. They say that police were called to the home, but Fanning sped off in the stolen vehicle. Police say that the teen was traveling at around 100 mph on Valley View when he crashed into a pickup truck driven by an elderly couple near Pennington Road shortly after 2:00 p.m.

Fanning was pronounced dead at the scene. The couple in the pickup truck were able to walk away from the crash, but were taken to an area hospital in stable condition.

The teen’s family says that they are sorry that others were pulled into his tragic plan.

“I’m sorry for the actions of my brother,” said Drayton Fanning. “You guys weren’t supposed to be involved. It’s not your fault or anybody else’s besides my brothers fault for doing that. He just did what he wanted when he wanted to.”
