A husband fatally stabbed his 25-year-old estranged wife and hours later killed himself with a 12-inch ceremonial knife as he fled from a sheriff's deputy, police said Wednesday.

Everest Metro Police Chief Dan Vergin identified the victims as Pa Houa Thao and her 31-year-old husband, Chor Thao.

"He died at his own hands with the murder weapon," Vergin said.

The couple were in the process of a divorce and not living together, Vergin said.

The Thaos had three children, ages 8, 6 and 4, who were not home when their mother was killed, Vergin said. The children are being cared for by aunts and uncles, he said.

Pa Thao's body was found in her next-door neighbor's yard late Tuesday morning. Police believe she was stabbed near her home and attempted to flee following some kind of confrontation in her bedroom, Vergin said.

The sheath for the knife was found about 50 feet from her body, the police chief said.

The man stabbed himself with the same knife in some woods about five miles away after a sheriff's deputy spotted him walking along a rural road Tuesday evening, Vergin said.

Marathon County Sheriff Randy Hoenisch said the deputy tried to disarm Chor Thao before the man stabbed himself in the chest. The deputy suffered a minor hand injury in the struggle, he said.

Chief Deputy Scott Parks said Thao said nothing to the deputy before stabbing himself.

According to Vergin, the Thaos had sought marriage counseling offered by Hmong leaders and elders in their families.

The wife was pregnant and had a boyfriend, he said.

Peter Yang, executive director of the Hmong Association in Wausau, one of several Wisconsin cities with large Hmong populations, said that in the Hmong culture, separation and divorce is rare because marriage is viewed as a commitment for life.
