RAYMOND, NH â€” Raymond police and police from several area towns responded to Gertrude Avenue on Friday for a report of a man and woman in a home, and that the woman might be injured.

When police arrived, they determined two people were inside the residence and believed the woman was in danger. Police closed off roads in the immediate area and had people leave their residences. Other residents, a further distance away from the incident, were also asked to remain inside their homes. Additional resources were requested from area towns, the Rockingham County Sheriff's Department, New Hampshire State Police, and Southern New Hampshire Special Operations Unit (SNHSOU).

After lengthy conversations, the woman from the residence came out of the home. She appeared to not have any serious injuries, according to neighbors who witnessed the incident. Police continued to speak to the man who remained in the home. After an extended conversation, the man was reported to be throwing items out of the home and for a short time, came out of the home. The man then retreated to the home and according to witnesses, two gunshots were heard.

Police were unable to make verbal contact with the man after trying repeatedly. SNHSOU and other officers made entry into the home and found the man deceased in the home. He appears to have died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
