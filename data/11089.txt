MOUNT VERNON, Wash. -- The Skagit County coroner has identified a 26-year-old Mount Vernon man fatally shot by deputy U.S. marshals.



Coroner Dan Dempsey identified the man as Michael Jenkins. An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday.



Mount Vernon police Lt. Chris Cammock said deputy marshals shot and killed the man Thursday afternoon after he opened fire on them. No marshals were injured.



Cammock told the Skagit Valley Herald that the marshals were trying to arrest the man on a second-degree assault warrant when the gunfire started. Police say the man was riding a bicycle when he encountered the marshals.
