A 40-year-old off-duty police officer and his 18-year-old companion were found shot to death in the officer’s Bronx apartment yesterday afternoon in what is being investigated as a possible murder-suicide, the police said. The woman’s body was found in the officer’s bed with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. The officer, Fred Maselli, was found shot in the head on the floor of the apartment, at 3611 Henry Hudson Parkway West. A gun was found near his body, the police said. Officer Maselli was a seven-year veteran of the force who worked at the 34th Precinct, the police said. Eddie Fishbaum, a neighbor, said that Officer Maselli was the father of two. The woman was identified by family members as Shirley Fontanez of Washington Heights, the mother of a 3-year-old girl. Ms. Fontanez’s mother, Maria Espinoza, 40, said that the couple had been dating for more than two years. Friends said Ms. Fontanez often complained that Mr. Maselli was threatening and abusive. “I was like, ‘Why are you still with this guy?’ ” said Monica Pinedu, a friend. She said that Ms. Fontanez responded, “Because he will kill me.”
