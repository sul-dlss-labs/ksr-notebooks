TUCSON, Ariz. (KOLD News 13) - Officials have released more details about an deputy-involved shooting from Jan. 20.

At approximately 3:30 a.m., deputies responded to the 2100 block of Morning Jewel Place in reference to a report of a man attempting to break into vehicles.

Deputies say the suspect had left the area before their arrival, however, they were able to get a description of the suspect’s vehicle.

The suspect was identified as 19-year-old Bradley Alexander Lewis. Responding deputies were aware Lewis had a previous weapons history. He was a wanted person for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, in which Lewis was a suspect for allegedly pointing a gun at someone.

Later on the morning of Jan. 20, just before 7 a.m., deputies located Lewis’ vehicle. Deputies attempted a traffic stop on Paseo De Angel near Positano Way. The vehicle fled to a nearby residence on Paseo De Angel, where Lewis rammed a patrol vehicle. Deputies say they saw Lewis exit the vehicle with a dark object in his hand.

Officers say Lewis charged Dep. Gilbert Caudillo with the object still in his hand, and Caudillo discharged his firearm, striking Lewis. Deputies immediately began rendering aid until Northwest Fire Department personnel arrived. While administering aid, deputies were able to identify the object in Lewis’ hand as a key fob with a lanyard.

Lewis was declared deceased at the hospital. Detectives report that no firearm was found on Lewis or at the scene.

Lewis had an extensive criminal history, including contacts with the Pima County Sheriff’s Department involving weapons. While processing the scene, a significant amount of dangerous drugs were discovered in Lewis’ vehicle.
