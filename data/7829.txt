A mother of two young children is dead and one of the Quad-Cities’ most well-known criminals is charged with vehicular homicide after a high-speed police pursuit through a residential area of Davenport ended in a crash.

Sharnice Johnson, 21, died Friday at the scene of the 7:20 a.m. crash at the corner of 1st Street and Linwood Avenue after the car she was a passenger in smashed into a tree.

Pachino Hill, 30, is charged with vehicular homicide, felony eluding and driving while barred. He was the driver of the Jeep Grand Cherokee, police said, that reached speeds of 80 mph during the seven-block pursuit that ended on a street that was ice-packed and rutted.

Travis Rush, 18, of Davenport, who was wanted in connection with a stabbing earlier this week as well as federal weapons charges, was a back-seat passenger.

All three were suspects in a home invasion early Friday in the 7200 block of Hillandale Road, officials said.

They were trapped inside the Jeep after the crash. Rush was airlifted to University Hospitals in Iowa City for treatment of a broken leg and possible internal injuries. Hill is listed in fair condition at Genesis Medical Center, East Rusholme Street, Davenport, where he is being treated for internal injuries, officials said.

According to police:

The home invasion was reported at 4:27 a.m. At least two men forced their way into an apartment, which prompted the resident to jump out a window to escape. The suspects fled in a light-colored Jeep Cherokee, driven by a female.

Later, as police were checking an address that Rush was known to frequent, they saw him and two others get into a light-colored Jeep Cherokee and drive away. That information was broadcast to patrol units.

A short time passed, when officers doing surveillance at 3rd and Division streets saw the Jeep Cherokee. When the squad car pulled out to follow, the driver of the Jeep accelerated in an attempt to flee.

They drove south on Division and west on 1st Street. Five blocks down the icy 1st Street, the Jeep crashed into a tree. The speed limit in the area is 25 mph, officials said. The police squad car was about a block behind the Jeep when it crashed.

The homicide charge carries the potential of up to 10 years in prison. The felony eluding charge has the potential of a five-year prison sentence.

More charges are possible, officials said. The vehicular homicide charge against Hill could be increased if authorities determine he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Scott County Attorney Mike Walton said. An increase could mean a sentence of up to 25 years in prison.

The pursuit will be reviewed, said Police Chief Frank Donchez. However, it appears that all policies were followed. Rush was on the list of “pursuable” people because he was accused of a forcible felony. Home invasion suspects also qualify as pursuable, he said.

The officer involved will not be placed on leave. Donchez declined to identify the officer.

UPDATED: Authorities have identified the victim in this morning's crash as Sharnice Johnson. She is from Davenport and believed to be 21 years old.

Records show that Sharnice Johnson gave birth to a boy on Jan. 11. More information on the victim will be published when it is available.

EARLIER STORY: One of the Quad-Cities’ most notorious criminals faces a homicide by vehicle charge after the SUV he was driving slammed into a tree during a high-speed police pursuit this morning, killing a female passenger, authorities said.

Pachino Hill was the driver of the Jeep Grand Cherokee involved in the crash at the corner of 1st Street and Linwood Avenue in Davenport, near the VFW Hall, shortly after 7:15 a.m.

The unidentified woman was the front-seat passenger in Hill’s vehicle. Travis Rush, 18, of Davenport, who was wanted for a stabbing earlier this week as well as federal weapons charges, was a back-seat passenger.

All three were suspects in a home invasion early today in the 7200 block of Hillandale Road, officials said.

The seven-block chase began at the corner of 3rd and Division streets at 7:18 a.m. Hill reached speeds around 80 mph, in a neighborhood where 25 mph is the limit, officials said.

The three were trapped inside of the Jeep after the crash. Rush was air-lifted to University Hospitals in Iowa City for treatment of a broken leg and possible internal injuries. Hill is listed in fair condition at Genesis Medical Center, East Rusholme Street, Davenport, where he is being treated for internal injuries, officials said.

According to police:

The home invasion was reported at 4:27 a.m. At least two black men forced their way into an apartment, which prompted the resident to jump out a window to escape.

The suspects fled in a light-colored Jeep Cherokee, driven by a black female.

Later, as police were checking an address that Rush was known to frequent, they saw him and two others get into a light-colored Jeep Cherokee and drive away. That information was broadcast to patrol units.

A short time passed, when officers doing surveillance at 3rd and Division streets saw the Jeep Cherokee. When the squad car pulled out to follow, the driver of the Jeep accelerated in an attempt to flee.

They drove south on Division and west on 1st Street. Five blocks down the icy 1st Street, the Jeep crashed into a tree.

In addition to vehicular homicide, Hill is charged with felony eluding. The homicide charge carries the potential of up to 10 years in prison. The felony eluding charge has the potential of a five-year prison sentence.

More charges are possible against Rush and Hill. The vehicular homicide charge against Hill could be increased after authorities determine whether he was under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Scott County Attorney Mike Walton said. An increase could mean a sentence of up to 25 years.

The pursuit will be reviewed, said Frank Donchez, police chief. However, it appears as if all policies were followed. Rush was on the list of “pursuable” people because he was accused of a forcible felony. Home invasion suspects also would qualify as pursuable, he said.

The officer involved will not be placed on leave. Donchez declined to identify the officer.

Christin Worton saw the truck “flying by” her home on 1st Street in Davenport. “I heard a big bang, and police all surrounded the vehicle,” said Worton, who lives across from the accident scene.

Worton works on a third-shift job and was trying to rest early Friday when the commotion began. She went outside to see police holding guns and a SWAT team. The sight of guns sent her back into the house, she said.

“This is such a great neighborhood. It’s just usually really quiet. We don’t have all these problems.”

In addition to the home invasion, Rush also is wanted in connection with a stabbing Tuesday. He is accused of stabbing Vincent C. Reid III, 18, twice in the leg during a fight at the Castlewood Apartments, 2100 Emerald Drive, police said.

At the time of the stabbing, Rush was out on bond while appealing his sentence in connection with a shooting in May 2008 in Davenport, officials said. According to police affidavits, Rush was armed with a handgun and fired two times at his victim, striking the victim once in the leg. The incident happened at 328 E. 14th St.

Rush was on the Davenport Police Department’s list of pursuable people because the accusations against him involve felonies with the use of weapons.

Besides the homicide by vehicle charge, Hill also faces a charge of felony eluding in connection with the chase.

Hill, most recently known for being sentenced to church, was charged when he was 14 with first-degree murder in the shooting death of Lawrence Brown Johnson. He pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and terrorism and was sentenced to 15 years in prison.

In December 2002, Hill was one of three men charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting at a Davenport police officer. One of those bullets missed the head of the Cpl. Dennis Colclasure by six inches, police investigators said.

A lack of evidence caused Scott County prosecutors to drop those charges. Hill was convicted of possessing a firearm as a felon in connection with that incident, but a judge later ruled the evidence insufficient to charge him with any offense and dismissed the case.

In October 2004, Hill was arrested on charges of helping Bryan Mitchell of Davenport leave the area of the fatal shooting of Grayling Church, 20, of Davenport. He also was accused of concealing the weapon and keeping witnesses from giving statements. He was found not guilty of that charge.

In March 2006, Hill was charged with attempted murder in the shooting of a 28-year-old man in the thigh. He pleaded guilty to assault resulting in bodily injury and was sentenced to one year probation and a $250 fine.

He was charged with child endangerment in April 2006, a drug charge in July 2006 and a domestic assault charge in August 2006. That charge prompted a police search because he fled after hitting a former girlfriend in the forehead with a bottle and slashing two tires on her car.

He received probation for the child endangerment and drug charges. The domestic assault case was dismissed.

In July 2007, he led police on a chase during a traffic enforcement effort on the Centennial Bridge. He pleaded guilty to driving while barred and received probation.

In March, he was sentenced to attend church for eight consecutive weeks and participate in a church-based counseling program as part of his probation for a police chase in October 2007.

Hill was driving a car with a broken headlight, down Fifth Street in Rock Island, testified Rock Island County Sheriff’s Deputy Justin Chisholm during Hill’s trial. Chisholm turned around and attempted to stop the Dodge Neon that Hill was driving. Instead, Hill took off and headed for the Centennial Bridge.

Hill and Chisholm crossed the bridge, turned right onto 2nd Street in downtown Davenport, up Main Street, over to Brady Street and then onto 12th Street.

Chisholm lost sight of Hill and his passenger in his car. As he turned onto 12th Street, approaching Pershing Avenue, he spotted Hill and his passenger running from an alley. Police later recovered the Neon parked behind a house in the alley.

Chisholm chased the two on foot, east toward Iowa Avenue. Chisholm used his Taser to bring Hill to the ground. Hill was then arrested.

In May, Hill faced a probation revocation after being accused of hitting another person with a metal pipe during a large fight at a hotel. He could have been sent to prison for more than two years. Instead, Judge Christine Dalton sentenced him to 30 days in jail.

Hill recently violated his probation again, officials said. A warrant was out for his arrest for that, and for a charge of driving while barred.

Hill also owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support.

Pachino Hill was driver in fatal morning accident

Rush was on the police department’s “pursuable” list, which means they are allowed to engage in a vehicle pursuit to capture him.

According to police:

Rush was a suspect in a home invasion at 4:27 a.m. today. Police said two males broke into a residence in the 7200 block of Hillandale Road, and the home’s occupant fled through a window. Two two men then fled in a silver SUV with a female driving.

Rush also is wanted in connection with a stabbing Tuesday. He is accused of stabbing Vincent C. Reid III, 18, twice in the leg during a fight at the Castlewood Apartments, 2100 Emerald Drive, police said.

Sharnice Johnson

Johnson was a mother of two children, a 3-week-old baby boy and a girl who turned 1 in November, according to county records.

The people gathered at Johnson’s mother’s apartment Friday declined immediate comment about her death.

On her MySpace page on the Internet, Johnson says that she is a “determined young women who is always struggling to survive. I believe in success and It should be everyones number one priority.” She listed as her occupation a disparaging phrase about police.

Johnson had a criminal record. At the age of 14, she was placed at the Toledo School for Girls for a charge of willful injury causing serious injury.

She has adult convictions for domestic assault, drug possession, child endangerment and gathering for use of marijuana. She had a marijuana possession charge pending against her.

Travis Rush

In addition to a home invasion early Friday, Rush also is wanted in connection with a stabbing Tuesday. He is accused of stabbing Vincent C. Reid III, 18, twice in the leg during a fight at the Castlewood Apartments, 2100 Emerald Drive, police said.

At the time of the stabbing, Rush was out on bond while appealing his sentence in connection with a shooting in May 2008 in Davenport, officials said.

According to Scott County District Court electronic records, Rush was 13 years old when he pleaded guilty in October 2003 to a charge of fifth-degree theft and a charge of fifth-degree criminal mischief. He was placed on probation, ordered to perform 25 hours of community service and was given a 9 p.m. curfew.

In March 2004, he pleaded guilty to charges of simple assault and operating a vehicle without the owner’s consent. He was sentenced to a curfew of 8 p.m., 25 hours of community service and placed on probation until his 18th birthday.

In March 2005, at age 14, he was convicted of two counts of third-degree burglary and assault. He was sentenced to a residential facility. In July of that year, he was ordered to Clarinda Academy, a residential treatment facility for delinquent youths in Clarinda, Iowa.

In October 2006, he was convicted of assault while using or displaying a weapon and intimidation with a dangerous weapon. An attempted murder charge was dropped in that case. Rush was ordered to the Eldora (Iowa) Juvenile Correctional Center.

While on furlough from Eldora in March 2007, Rush, then 16, was arrested with three other teens on a weapons charge. The teens were driving around Davenport with a sawed-off shot gun. Rush pleaded guilty to a charge in that case of carrying weapons. He was given a 240-day suspended jail sentence.

On Sept. 5, Rush pleaded guilty to charges of willful injury with serious injury and being a felon in possession of a firearm in connection with the May 16 shooting of Jeremy Booth in the 300 block of East 14th Street in Davenport. Booth was shot once in the leg.

At his sentencing in October, Rush was given five years in prison on each of the charges. The sentences were to run consecutively. However, he was released on bond pending the outcome of an appeal.
