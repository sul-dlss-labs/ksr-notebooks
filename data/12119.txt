A gunman opened fire in a Pella neighborhood around 8:30 this morning. Police say the shooter tried to chase down a man on foot before getting into a deadly standoff with officers.

“I heard just these big, like these five banging noises and I thought maybe someone was kicking a garbage can or something,” says Lisa Roose.

What Roose heard was gunfire from 49-year-old William Shaw as police say he chased after her neighbor in Brook Circle.

“My kids stand right here to ride the bus and I`m glad they were at school and everything is Okay,” says Roose.

“There was a considerable number of rounds fired,” says Pella Police Chief Robert Bokinsky.

The shots missed and the man wasn’t hurt. After leaving Brook Circle, officers caught up with Shaw a short time later at 5th and University.

“What resulted was about a 20 minute standoff. He never presented himself as a threat to the officers other than he was armed,” says Bokinsky.

Authorities say the standoff came to an “unfortunate end”, when Shaw turned the gun on himself. When he was no longer a threat, police focused on possible motives for the shooting. Shaw lives in Freemont about 35 miles away.

“There was some type of dispute that led to this and we`re trying to get to the bottom of that now,” says Bokinsky.

As authorities search for answers, neighbors are still on edge.

“It`s scary. Especially after what happened in Connecticut and it`s right across the street from me,” says Roose.

“You hate to see something like this happen, but the fact remains that nobody else was injured and that is the one positive here,” says Bokinsky.

During the standoff, Central College went into lockdown as a precaution. The Division of Criminal Investigation spent the day processing both crime scenes.
