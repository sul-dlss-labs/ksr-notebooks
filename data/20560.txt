MIDDLEBURG, Pa. -- A man who held three people hostage in a rural Snyder County home for about 14 hours has been shot and killed by a state police sniper. Kayre Snyder, 45, was shot about 4:10 a.m. today at a door of his home on Strawberry Lane in Middlecreek Twp., Snyder County District Attorney Mike Piecuch said.

“During the hours and hours of negotiation, the gunman was given every opportunity to either release the hostages or surrender peaceably,” Piecuch said. “He refused to do so. The police did what they needed to do to protect those hostages and the other residents in the neighborhood.”

Police did not release the names of the hostages but they said they were Snyder's mother, pastor and his wife. Snyder was involved in a scuffle with his father in a vehicle during which a shot was fired about 2:30 p.m. Thursday, police said. The father, whose name also was not disclosed, escaped, and Snyder, who lived with his parents, drove home, they said.

During the standoff, six homes in the immediate area were evacuated. No one was injured, police said.
