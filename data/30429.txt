A wanted man who had led law enforcement on a pursuit was shot to death by a sheriff’s deputy on Tuesday, June 15, as he ran in the lanes of the 215 Freeway near Perris holding a gun, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department said Wednesday, June 16.

The investigation prompted authorities to close the 215 Freeway between Ethanac Road and McCall Boulevard for hours.

The man, who had not been publicly identified, was wanted on an arrest warrant for assault with a deadly weapon in Ventura County, authorities said.

The incident began with undercover U.S. Border Patrol agents spotting the man after receiving a bulletin from Ventura County, said Jeff Stephenson, a Border Patrol spokesman. Agents followed the car on the southbound I-15 Freeway until the driver exited and parked at a gas station.

“When agents attempted to take the man into custody, he drove his vehicle toward the agents and struck two Border Patrol vehicles as he fled the area,” authorities said in a statement.

Sheriff’s deputies attempted to pull over the car in Temecula, but the suspect continued driving, heading through Temecula and Menifee and traveling north and south on the 215. The suspect eventually stopped near the center median just south of Ethanac Road and ran from the car and into the southbound lanes while carrying a gun, the statement said.

That’s when he was shot, with the precise reason why the deputy fired not yet disclosed.

“As more facts and or information becomes available through the investigation, it will be released,” said sheriff’s Sgt. Deanna Pecoraro, a department spokeswoman.
