A man was fatally shot by officers in Lowndes County after he did not comply with commands to drop a knife he was holding as officers tried to serve an outstanding arrest warrant, WSFA News reported.

According to Joe Herman with the State Bureau of Investigation, officers responded to a residence on Braxton Drive to serve outstanding felony arrest warrants on George Crenshaw.

When officers arrived, Crenshaw ran out of the house into the woods, WSFA reported. Later, someone called officers after Crenshaw returned to the home.

Herman told WSFA two officers returned to serve warrants and encountered Crenshaw. He said Crenshaw “came at them" with an 8 to 10-inch kitchen knife in “very close proximity” in a small kitchen area.

Witnesses told investigators they heard the officers tell him to drop the knife multiple times, he said. When Crenshaw continued to wield the knife and advance towards the officers, they deployed a taser, then fired a weapon, WSFA reported.

The Alabama State Bureau of Investigation is handling the case. When the investigation is over, it will be handed over to the Lowndes County District Attorney’s Office and presented to a grand jury.
