A Colton car-theft investigation turned deadly when the driver used the vehicle to attack police, who opened fire, killing the man, investigators said.

The gunfire was reported about 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, July 11, on Mill Street, near the entrance to a flood-control basin between Pepper and Meridian avenues in San Bernardino near the Colton city limits.

The confrontation happened when two officers in separate patrol cars tried to stop a 1994 Honda Accord after a license plate check showed that the vehicle had been stolen recently in the High Desert, said Detective Ray Mendez.

“As they attempted to stop him, he … assaulted (one) officer with the vehicle,” said Mendez, who said he didn’t have details of the assault.

The driver died at the scene. His identity has not been released. A female passenger suffered an unspecified shoulder injury and was treated and released at a local hospital, Mendez said.

San Bernardino County sheriff’s detectives are investigating the shooting.

At 2:30 p.m. — more than 12 hours after the gunfire — a short stretch of Mill Street remained closed between the flood-control basin on the south side and two dirt fields on the north.

The Sheriff’s Department’s mobile command post offered investigators an air-conditioned retreat from the stifling heat, that hovered around 105 degrees.

Green evidence markers showed where the incident happened on the south sidewalk.
