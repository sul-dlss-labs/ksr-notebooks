A state trooper fatally shot a 51-year-old man who walked out of the bedroom of his South Jersey home carrying two long guns and pointed one of them at troopers, the Attorney General's Office said.

Troopers went to the home of James Nelson in Pittsgrove in Salem County early this morning after his son reported Nelson had ingested a large number of pills and was suicidal, authorities said.

When troopers arrived, they found Nelson holding a handgun to his head. "Nelson then retreated into a bedroom," the Attorney General's Office said in a written statement. The troopers called for backup, and a State Police tactical unit and crisis negotiation team responded.

Nelson came out of the bedroom "carrying a rifle or shotgun in each hand and pointed the guns in the direction" of troopers in the tactical unit, the statement said. Trooper Sam Cappuccio then "fired a single shot from his gun, striking Nelson in the head." Nelson was pronounced dead at the scene at about 1:46 a.m.

The incident is being investigated by the attorney general's shooting response team.

"It sounds like a very unfortunate situation," Pittsgrove Mayor Peter Voros said. "It seemed this gentlemen was under extreme stress. We have 100 percent confidence in the State Police. They're well-trained and were trying to defuse the situation. It seemed to end up where they did the only thing they could do."
