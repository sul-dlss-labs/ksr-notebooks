GARY | Lake County police are investigating a fatal shooting involving Gary police officers and at least four suspects, Lake County Police Chief Marco Kuyachich said Monday.

The shootout was the result of a drug-related incident gone bad, Kuyachich said. Police have three people in custody and one person is dead, but Kuyachich declined to release the suspects' identities.

Kuyachich said the investigation is ongoing and more information wasn't available Monday. A Gary police spokesman couldn't be reached for comment Monday evening.

The Lake County coroner's office identified the deceased as 28-year-old Gary resident Darnell Russell.

Russell, who lived in the 6100 block of East 6th Place, was pronounced dead after sustaining multiple gunshot wounds in the 5500 block of East 5th Avenue at 1 p.m.

An autopsy is scheduled for Tuesday.
