Hunkin died on April 22 outside of a Randall's grocery at William Cannon Drive and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) in Southwest Austin after police say he charged the officer while brandishing two knives. Paredes was the first to arrive at the scene after a 911 caller reported a man in the grocery store parking lot threatening people with knives.

Paredes was placed on administrative leave, per standard Austin police policy.
