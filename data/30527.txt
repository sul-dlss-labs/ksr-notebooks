A man is dead following a stand-off at a home in Grant, according to the Marshall County Sheriffâ€™s Office.

Assistant Chief Deputy Steve Guthrie said deputies, along with Grant police, were dispatched Monday to a domestic violence call at 370 Wooten Rd. in Grant.

Upon arriving, they were met by a woman who told them she fled her home due to an altercation with Robert George Kitelinger, who she said was intoxicated, armed and still inside.

Guthrie said deputies attempted to make contact with Kitelinger through the doorway in hopes he would come out, but he did not respond. The SWAT team was also summoned.

After several hours, authorities found Kitelinger with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, Guthrie said. He was transported to Huntsville Hospital, where he died.

Police with Guntersville, Arab and Grant, along with the Marshall County Drug Unit, took part in the incident.
