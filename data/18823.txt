A man was shot and killed by a California Highway Patrol officer responding to a report of a pedestrian on the freeway in Santa Monica early Monday, authorities said.

The CHP received a report of a man walking on the 10 Freeway near the Centinela Avenue offramp about 12:20 a.m., said Officer Alex Rubio.

When officers arrived, they found the pedestrian walking along the center median with a knife in his hand, Los Angeles County sheriff’s Lt. Joe Mendoza told reporters at the scene.

The man then ran off the freeway and south toward Pico Boulevard, Mendoza said. When officers closed in, the man ran at them still holding the knife and they opened fire, Mendoza said.

The man was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. At least two officers fired their weapons and another used a Taser, KABC-TV reported.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is investigating the shooting.
