Topeka police fatally shot armed homicide suspect Jesse B. Lees about 11:15 a.m. Friday near the 700 block of S.W. Polk, said Interim Topeka Police Chief Bryan Wheeles. No officers were hurt.

Lees was taken to a local hospital, where police public information specialist Gretchen Spiker said he died Friday evening.

Multiple officers fired gunshots during the confrontation, Wheeles said. Police weren't releasing the names of any of the officers involved.

The shooting of Lees was thought to be related to vehicle crashes that occurred in the same area at about the same time, Wheeles said. Crime scene tape surrounded two damaged vehicles early Friday afternoon near S.W. 8th and Polk.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation was investigating to determine circumstances of the shooting, including how many officers fired their guns, he said.

The Topeka police officers involved had been placed on paid administrative leave, as is the department's standard practice and procedure, Spiker said.

Police encountered Lees while following up on a tip, Wheeles said.

Police had been seeking Lees, 33, of Topeka, in connection with the homicide death of Jennifer A. Morris, 25, of Topeka.

Morris' body was found shortly after 5:30 p.m. Wednesday inside a home in the 3400 block of S.W. Briarwood Lane. Her cause death wasn't being made public.

Briarwood Lane runs north and south and is located about one block west of S.W. MacVicar Avenue.

Topeka police on Thursday put out a public request for information that would help them locate Lees for questioning in the case.
