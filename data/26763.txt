SPENCER COUNTY, Ind. â€” A Missouri man died Wednesday, three days after he was taken into custody by law enforcement officers in Spencer County.

State Police are investigating the death and what lead up to it.

Here's what they said happened in a release:

Taylor Ware, 24, of Kansas City, Missouri, was seen at a rest area near the 58-mile marker on Interstate 64 in Spencer County on Sunday. Dale Police first responded after a 911 call report of an agitated adult male.

The Dale K-9 officer tried to reason with Ware several times but was unsuccessful, and a struggle between the two began, during which Ware reportedly battered the Dale officer. The Dale officer deployed his K-9 partner "in efforts to gain control of the situation."

A Santa Claus Police officer arrived moments later and saw Ware continue to resist the officer and his K-9. The Santa Claus officer used his taser, but couldn't subdue Ware who then began to choke the K-9 with one hand and grabbed at the Santa Claus' taser with the other. With the taser in his hand, Ware tried to use it on the Santa Claus officer.

Troopers from the Jasper Post arrived on the scene and were able to help get Ware into handcuffs and "temporarily subdued" until an ambulance waiting nearby arrived a few minutes later. Ware continued to resist while being provided medical attention at the scene.

Ware was taken to Jasper Memorial Hospital before being transferred to the University of Louisville Hospital where he died. The cause of his death is unknown at this time. An autopsy is planned for Saturday morning.

Anyone witnessing the struggle at the rest stop is asked to call Indiana State Police Jasper Post at 1-800-742-7475.
