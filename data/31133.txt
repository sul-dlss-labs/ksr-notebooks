San Antonio police say one person is dead following a pursuit of a robbery suspect late Monday night.

SAN ANTONIO – A suspect wanted for several felony offenses led officers on a multi-county pursuit before he fatally shot himself in the head in a South Side neighborhood, according to San Antonio police.

Police said the man in his 20s was found in his vehicle with a self-inflicted gunshot wound at the end of the chase around 10 p.m. Monday at Interstate 35 and Sims Avenue. He has not been publicly identified by SAPD.

Earlier that night, officers attempted to pull him over, but he left San Antonio via Interstate 10 East, police said.

Before the vehicle left the city limits, a male passenger exited the car and was taken into custody. That man, who has not been identified, had a handgun and confirmed the driver was the person that officers were looking for, police said.

The driver continued on Interstate 10 toward Seguin and deputies with the Guadalupe County Sheriff’s Office attempted to stop him.

He then turned around near Seguin and headed back to San Antonio on Interstate 10, where deputies with the Bexar County Sheriff’s Office tried to stop the vehicle with spike strips.

The attempt by BCSO was unsuccessful, police said, and SAPD took over the pursuit when the vehicle entered their jurisdiction.

The driver headed westbound on Interstate 10 and then onto Interstate 35 South. He exited the Division exit and police used a maneuver to stop the vehicle.

Police said the vehicle came to a stop in the front yard of a home in the 200 block of Sims, and the driver did not exit the car.

Officers approached the vehicle to check on the driver, as they couldn’t see inside, and found him dead, according to SAPD.

No SAPD officers shot at the suspect, according to a preliminary report.

It is unclear what charges the suspect was wanted for.
