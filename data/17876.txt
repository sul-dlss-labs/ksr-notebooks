FRESNO, Texas – A man turned a gun on himself Saturday afternoon after he shot and killed his girlfriend at her home in Fresno, according to investigators with the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office.

Jonas Nelson, 35, called a family friend seconds after he shot and killed his 30-year-old girlfriend at a home in the 1800 block of Purple Cherry Lane near Acorn Glen, according to deputies.

“My brother said he was shot in the chest and that he killed his girlfriend,” Nelson’s sister, Yano Kelly said.

Deputies said once they arrived, they heard a gunshot fired. The Fort Bend County SWAT team showed up and quickly discovered the couple dead.

"Everybody can't be fixed. If he's threatening to kill you — leave," Kelly said.

Kelly tried contacting the victim, but by that time it was too late.

"I texted her, 'hey please call me (or) text me. Let me know you are OK because my brother is saying that he killed you," Kelly said.

Kelly said she told the victim to get a restraining order, but the woman told her she loved Nelson and couldn't do it. Kelly added that the victim just wanted Nelson to come by and get his clothes.

Officers said they pinged the woman's cellphone inside the home. FBCSO officials said deputies went door-to-door urging all residents to stay inside their homes.

Kelly said the couple had a history of domestic violence that came to light this week. She said the two were breaking up.

"She just thought he was salvageable, and he wasn't," Kelly said. "He was just too far gone."
