A predawn police pursuit that continued for 37 miles and exceeded 100 miles per hour ended early Sunday when a Farmington man crashed into a tree in Red Wing and died.

The driver was Cody James Swanson, 24. Farmington Police Chief Brian Lindquist said an officer tried to stop Swanson near 220th Street W. and Canton Court after noticing that the car, a 2011 Buick sedan that had been reported stolen from the Shakopee area, had only one headlight and was being driven ­“suspiciously.”

Instead of pulling over, Swanson took off, leading the officer 37 miles before crashing on Cannon River Avenue, just off Hwy. 61, about 4:30 a.m. The State Patrol said he was not wearing a seat belt and it was not immediately known if alcohol was a factor. The road was dry at the time, the patrol said.

Authorities twice deployed speed sticks to try to stop Swanson’s vehicle. He evaded the first set, at Dakota County Road 47 and Hwy. 50, Lindquist said. It’s unclear whether he hit or evaded the second set near Red Wing.

Lindquist said that police have had previous contact with Swanson, but he would not go into detail.

The chief said Farmington police do have a pursuit policy and that the officer chasing Swanson followed that policy.

The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave while the crash is investigated, Lindquist said.

State court records show that Swanson had been convicted of several drug offenses, burglary and driving after suspension.
