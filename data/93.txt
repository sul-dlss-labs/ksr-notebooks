Chicago police today ruled that officers were justified in fatally shooting a Chicago man early this morning after he allegedly fired at them during a foot chase on the South Side, according to police spokesman Pat Camden.

Eugene Guy, 21, of the 4500 block of South Federal Street, was killed about 1 a.m. in a shootout with two unidentified police officers, Camden said.

The shooting occurred shortly after a squad car pulled up to three men who were talking at the corner of 43rd Street and South Michigan Avenue. Police said Guy had a gun in his hand and took off running to avoid arrest.

During a foot chase with one of the officers, Guy allegedly fired several shots, Camden said. The other officer was following the pursuit in his squad car.

Initially, the officers did not return gunfire, police said.

Guy then scaled a wrought-iron fence near 45th and South Michigan and allegedly started shooting at the officers from the other side of the fence, according to police. This time, police returned fire, striking Guy in the chest and killing him.

Camden said a police department meeting after the shooting found that the officers followed regulations.

Between eight and ten shots were fired during the incident, said Steve Williams, 45, a security guard at the Inner City Youth Foundation, located at 4500 S. Michigan Ave., near the scene of the shooting.

Williams said that when he went outside he saw a body on the ground in the rear parking lot of the Chicago Urban League, 4510 S. Michigan Ave., and 10 to 12 officers standing over the body. Guy died at the scene, police said.
