Investigations are underway in the deadly police shooting of a Basin man. The man’s name was released Tuesday. He was identified as 55-year old Ed Farlow. The name of the officer involved has not been released.

Police said the officer responded to a parking complaint from Farlow’s neighbor Sunday afternoon. Chief Chris Kampbell said Farlow pointed a gun at the policeman when he approached Farlow’s home. Kampbell said the officer shot Farlow, who died in the hospital later.

The police chief said the officer did as he was trained to do, but Basin Police the State Department of Criminal Investigation are investigating the incident.

Chief Kampbell said, “This is completely to be expected in this sort of thing. Everything is being done right now in accordance to what would happen in any type of shooting.”

The officer involved is on administrative leave. Kampbell said the shooting is the first in Big Horn County in nearly two decades. The last one involved a Basin police officer in 1996.
