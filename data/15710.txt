Desmond Luster Sr. was no criminal — in fact, he was fed up with crime.

“He was ranting and raving because he was tired of people breaking into his house and getting away with it,” said one neighbor, who asked not to be identified for fear that she would be targeted by burglars herself.

She said that on Monday afternoon — after two recent break-ins — Luster, 45, “must’ve just snapped.” Luster got in his pickup and chased people who he believed had broken into his home. He instead wound up shot to death by a police officer. The officer told dispatchers that Luster told him he was trying to run down the suspects.

Luster’s friends, neighbors and former co-workers said they were stunned by the uncharacteristic behavior Monday of a man they described as a calm, humorous family man who had grown increasingly concerned with crime in his neighborhood in recent years.

“He was fiercely loyal when his family was concerned,” said a longtime friend, Dwayne Traylor.

Luster reported to police Friday night that someone had kicked in his back door around 10:30 p.m. in the 6700 block of Shadow Creek Drive in southeast Oak Cliff. He visited a neighbor to ask if she heard anything — she heard a loud boom — and he complained that the thief had “cleaned out” his 17-year-old son’s room.

He also told her he was angry because his house had been broken into previously and he felt the police response was slow and inadequate, said the neighbor. The neighborhood has been plagued by a rash of burglaries, records show.

Police records show eight burglaries, two thefts and two reports of criminal mischief or vandalism in the last year at homes on Luster's quarter-mile-long street.

Luster’s neighbor said he had complained of about three break-ins prior to the one Monday. Police records show at least two other 911 calls from Luster’s house in recent years. He was listed as a victim of criminal mischief in June 2014. The report shows his garage door sustained about $200 of damage.

“He had mentioned to me that some of the neighborhoods in Dallas were not what they used to be ... more crime,” said Anthony Henderson, 45, who now lives in Cincinnati and knew Luster and Luster’s wife since they were all students at the University of North Texas.

Witnesses said frustration over that rising crime forced him to take matters into his own hands Monday. Police say that about 1:30 p.m., Luster fired shots and jumped a curb in the 7400 block of Bonnie View Road in his blue Dodge pickup while chasing juveniles who were running from his home.

Officer Aaron Tolerton, a six-year veteran who was working off-duty security at Flying J truck stop, went to investigate the reported gunfire and saw a teen running, police said. The officer arrested the teen and then saw a blue Dodge pickup speeding toward them off the road. Tolerton fired repeatedly into the truck, striking Luster.

The officer noted in a recorded exchange with a dispatcher that someone was wounded. Then, with information he apparently received from the mortally wounded Luster, he explained what happened.

“He’s telling me the two males that ran off were breaking into his [house] and he tried to ram them and me,” Tolerton said.

The officer has been placed on routine administrative leave. He has not yet given a statement to investigators, but will probably do so later this week, according to department policy.

The dead man’s mother, Beverly Luster-Brown, told KDFW-TV (Channel 4) on Tuesday that she made the 911 call Monday after Luster called her and told her someone had broken into his house. She said she told the 911 operator that her son was a process server and was authorized to carry a weapon and that he had fired it while chasing the thieves.

Luster was described as an “active shooter” over police radio. “That active shooter, he’s gonna be wearing a black shirt, blue jeans, jumping into a black pickup truck,” a dispatcher said.

Luster had no record of criminal history. In 2006, he was embroiled in a cheating scandal at Dallas Fire-Rescue. Investigators accused an instructor of helping Luster, who did poorly in his recruit class, cheat on the final exam, in which he scored at the top of his class. Luster resigned under investigation.

He had a son who starred at football at Skyline High School. Desmond Luster Jr., accepted a scholarship last week to play at Southeastern Oklahoma State University.

For about seven years, the elder Luster worked as a delivery driver for Oak Farms Dairy. He left late last year, former co-workers said.

Stephanie Sanders, an Oak Farms employee who worked with Luster, said Tuesday that she was shocked by the news of his death.

“The guy I always saw at work was always smiling, laughing and joking around,” she said. “I don’t even see him being aggressive or carrying a gun. I guess if your home’s been broken into that many times, you have to take some type of action.”
