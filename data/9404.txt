Two 15-year-olds are dead and three more people are in critical condition after a police chase in Calumet City ended in a crash in Chicago early Friday, officials said.

Clarence Rounds and Brittany Johnson, of Blue Island, were killed in the one-car wreck at 115th and Halsted streets, the Cook County medical examiner's office said. Rounds' hometown wasn't immediately available.

According to Calumet City Capt. Dan Zorzi, at 1:16 a.m., a woman told police she was driving in the 1900 block of Sibley Boulevard when another vehicle drove alongside her and someone inside pointed a handgun at her.

The woman told police she saw the silver Buick pull into the parking lot of the McDonald's restaurant there. She saw a Calumet City police squad at Sibley Boulevard and Madison Avenue and relayed the incident to the officer.

That officer saw the car westbound on Sibley Boulevard and began following it. The officer chased the vehicle through portions of Dolton, Riverdale, Calumet Park and Chicago, Zorzi said.

At 115th and Halsted streets in Chicago, the driver of the Buick lost control after hitting the median and slammed into a pole. Johnson was pronounced dead at the scene and Rounds died a few hours later at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn.

Three others in the vehicle are in critical condition, Zorzi said. One woman was transported to Advocate Christ and two others, whose gender were not immediately known, were taken to Stroger Hospital, he said.

Zorzi said the car involved in the chase and crash was reported stolen in a carjacking Thursday in Chicago. Police recovered a gun at the scene of the crash, he said.

Chicago police are assisting Calumet City detectives in the investigation.
