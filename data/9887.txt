Stephen Bullock, a 33-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy Friday, Feb. 18, in the 900 block of East New York Drive in Altadena, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Deputies stopped two men in a vehicle for a traffic violation about 11:30 p.m., Sgt. Debra Herman said. Bullock got out of the passenger side of the car and ran, and deputies chased him.

After a couple hundred yards, Bullock stopped and struggled with one of the deputies, Sheriff’s Capt. Ray Leyva said. When he pulled a gun from his waistband, the deputy pulled his weapon and fired one shot at the suspect, Leyva said.

Bullock was pronounced dead at the scene. A gun was recovered from the location.

The deputy’s name was not released.
