LAWRENCE COUNTY, Ala. (WHNT) — A high speed chase in Lawrence County ended in a deadly wreck.

Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputies stopped a vehicle around 9:00 Saturday night on Highway 24, east of Moulton. When law enforcement went to check the driver’s information, deputies say the driver took off, getting up to speeds of 100 miles per hour.

Emergency workers say the deputies lost sight of the car on County Road 331, but found tire tracks going off the road. They say the vehicle lost control and crashed through a fence and tress, flipping several times.

The driver, Gregory Johnson, 30 of Danville, was thrown from the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene.

His 5-year-old daughter was also in the car. We’re told she was taken to Lawrence Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.

State Troopers are investigating.
