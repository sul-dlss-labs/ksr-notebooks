Pam Cupps had planned to retire in two years from her job at the Alabama Department of Human Resources, a relative said.



"But a thief took care of that," said Cupps' sister-in-law Donna Terry.



Cupps was killed Saturday night, and her husband seriously injured, when a car driven by a shoplifting suspect ran through a red traffic signal and struck their vehicle. Fultondale police had ended a chase of the car containing the suspect just prior to the crash.



Efforts to reach Fultondale Police officials for comment have been unsuccessful.



"I just don't think the police should be chasing thieves at such high speeds," Terry said.



David Cupps works at Tile Plus in Gardendale and Pamela Cupps had worked at DHR for 23 years, Terry said.



Pamela and David Cupps have two children and one 5-year-old grandson.
