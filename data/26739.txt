ANTIOCH — Authorities have identified the Brentwood man killed July 18 in an early morning police chase in Antioch.

Omar Jalal Harb, 21, died after crashing an allegedly stolen silver SUV into a tree around 1 a.m. July 18, according to police.

The crash occurred in the 1100 block of Buchanan Road after the car the man was driving crossed over the raised divider, police said. The chase started after officers were tipped off by another city about a vehicle stolen during a residential burglary and spotted it on Somersville Road. Harb had prior arrests for burglary, according to public records.

Public records indicate Harb may have suffered from a mental illness. In 2018, he was one of more than a dozen people who petitioned for sanctions against the Department of State Hospitals for not transferring them to a mental institution after they had been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.

The officers turned on their vehicle’s lights and sirens, but the SUV accelerated south on Somersville Road to Buchanan, where it then went east. The chase went on for about 1½ miles on Buchanan before the crash.

The chase and crash are being investigated by the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s office, per a county policy regarding all deaths involving law enforcement officers. At some point, a coroner’s inquest will review the death in a hearing where involved officers will be called to testify.
