Rockport police found a man dead inside a house early Thursday after a more than three-hour standoff with SWAT.

While en route to a domestic disturbance call about 10 p.m. Wednesday, officers received more calls about multiple shots fired inside and outside one of the buildings at a town homes complex on Farm-to-Market Road 3036, according to a Rockport police news release.

Police said Elvin Clyde Loyd III, 28, barricaded himself and his 8-month-old son inside an apartment. During the first hour of the standoff, several shots were fired inside and outside the house by the man, police said. The man's family members told police he had access to multiple weapons and ammunition, including a shotgun and AR-15 gun.

About 2 a.m., SWAT members with the San Patricio Sheriff's Office entered the home. Police said the man was dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound when they found him. It appears the gunshot wound occurred more than an hour before SWAT entered the home, the release stated. The child was found unharmed.

The baby's mother was at the home when police first arrived, said Rockport police Cmdr. Larry Sinclair. She and the boy are staying with family in Rockport.

Neighbors were evacuated to the Fulton Volunteer Fire Department and the road was closed in that area to traffic. The Aransas County Sheriff's Office, Fulton VFD, Fulton Police Department, Rockport Volunteer Fire Department, San Patricio Sheriff's Office, Texas Department of Public Service and Allegiance emergency medical services assisted in the hourslong incident.
