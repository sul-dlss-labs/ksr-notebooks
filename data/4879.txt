Fullerton police Wednesday identified a man killed last week during a confrontation with two officers as Manuel Mondragon, 30.

Officers fired at Mondragon about 6:30 p.m. Feb. 2 when he brandished an assault rifle after being ordered to stay away from the gun, police said.

The officers, identified as Sam Contino and Adrian Wardle, were responding to a call of shots fired at a Camino Escondido home.

They saw Mondragon, who did not live at the home, through a window and fired when he grabbed the rifle.

Police surrounded the home for more than six hours before discovering Mondragon’s body inside shortly after midnight.

His motive for being in the house remains under investigation.
