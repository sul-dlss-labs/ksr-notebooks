ST. LOUIS • A chaotic shooting and standoff scene in the Old North St. Louis neighborhood Sunday afternoon was a murder-suicide that left a female victim and the gunman dead, and three others critically injured, police said Monday.

They identified Marlo Boyd, 41, as the suspected shooter in the incident that saw an area in the neighborhood cordoned off while negotiators and a SWAT team tried to gain entry to an apartment. He and Deanna Williams, 18, were found dead inside the apartment when officers entered, about three hours after shots were first fired.

Both lived in the 1900 block of North 14th Street, where the shootings took place. Critically injured were a girl, 15, and two women, ages 39 and 42.

Authorities did not give a motive in the shooting, but said the gunman and victims were all connected.

Police say they were first called to a reported shooting just after noon. They found the injured 15-year-old and 39-year-old, who said they had been shot by Boyd inside an apartment. They were taken to a hospital in critical condition.

Officers heard gunshots from inside the apartment while on the scene. A hostage response and SWAT team was called in. They could be heard calling Boyd’s name with a bullhorn, and later sent a robot into the apartment.

Police eventually entered the apartment about 3:30 p.m. and found Williams and Boyd dead and the 42-year-old victim critically injured.

Boyd had shot the others and then shot himself in the head after police arrived at the scene, according to the investigation.
