Man dies in car crash during police chase

A northwest Iowa man is dead after leading authorities on a chase and crashing a stolen car. The Iowa State Patrol says 21 year old Jameson Sierck was pronounced dead at the Palo Alto County Hospital in Emmetsburg. Patrol cars from Spencer and Clay County attempted to stop a car reported stolen out of Sanborn Saturday morning. Troopers say Sierck fled from law enforcement to avoid capture. The high speed chase led authorities from Clay County into Palo Alto County where the suspect lost control of the car on a gravel road. The car Sierck was driving went into the ditch and rolled several times before coming to rest in a cornfield. The chase and fatal accident occurred around Saturday morning 7 miles south of Ayrshire.
