COLUMBUS (WCMH) — The Columbus Division of Police has released the name of the officer involved in a shooting death Wednesday morning.

Officer Andrew Hawkins is an 11-year veteran of the Division, according to CPD.

The Bureau of Criminal Investigations is combing through the scene on the 2400 block of Kimberly Parkway. So far, police believe a domestic dispute led to the shooting around 9:30 a.m. after a man threatened a woman with a knife.

Officers ordered Kyle Anthony Veyon to drop the knife several times, and even attempted to use a Taser, according to CPD.

However, when Veyon approached the woman, investigators said one of the officers opened fire.

“The officers, multiple times, attempted to get the suspect to drop the knife,” said Columbus Division of Police Sgt. James Fuqua. “Those attempts were unsuccessful, and one officer did discharge their firearm multiple times, striking the suspect. And unfortunately, the suspect ultimately succumbed to their injuries from the gunshots.”

Veyon was transported to Grant Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

No police officers were injured, according to CPD.

Investigators said both responding officers were wearing body cameras and that once the information is reviewed, the footage will be released to the public.
