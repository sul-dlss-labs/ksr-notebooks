EARLHAM, Iowa — A motorcyclist and passenger died Saturday afternoon when their vehicle crashed near U.S. Interstate 80 east of Earlham shortly after trying to outrun a Dallas County Sheriff’s Deputy in pursuit.

The deputy terminated the chase a short while before the wreck occurred about 5:15 p.m. on 360th Street (County Road F90) just south of 360th Place, according to Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Alex Dinkla.

The motorcyclist apparently continued to operate at a high rate of speed following the pursuit and lost control of the vehicle on a curve of 360th Street, Dinkla said.

The male driver and female passenger were pronounced dead at the scene, he said.

Radio traffic indicated the motorcycle was traveling westbound on 360th Street at about 75 mph prior to the crash.

The Iowa State Patrol, Earlham First Responders, Earlham Volunteer Fire Department, Van Meter First Responders, Van Meter Volunteer Fire Department, Dallas County Sheriff’s office, Madison County Sheriff’s office and Dallas County EMS responded.
