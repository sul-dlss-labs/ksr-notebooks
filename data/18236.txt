TUCSON (KGUN9-TV) - A woman killed her father, then herself in an incident on the west side of Pima County.

The Pima County Sheriff's Department has identified the man as 71-year-old David Vystricl, and the woman as 45-year-old Marie Weber.

It all happened at a home in the 4200 block of South Old Windmill Lane, near Bopp and San Joaquin.

Deputies say the incident started late morning on Friday.

A woman called her brother and told him to come over. He found his father dead. He and his son had to run for their lives as the woman shot at them.

Sheriff Chris Nanos says the brother's story convinced deputies they'd better turn out in strength because they could be headed into an especially dangerous scene.

"They go into the residence and they find the father deceased and go to the back bedroom and find his sister armed with a handgun. She fires at them as they flee the residence. As they get out of the residence they call 911," said Nanos.

The situation brought in the Pima County Regional SWAT Team, and a robot that finally resolved what deputies treated as stand-off that lasted from mid-morning to mid-afternoon.

Sheriff Nanos says the family says the woman has a history of mental illness. "That she also suffers severely from drug addiction and that she has been a problem for the family for a number of years," said Nanos.

Deputies tried to make contact inside the house but got nothing. That's when they sent in a robot to search that found the woman, and her father dead.
