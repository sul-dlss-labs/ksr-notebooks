SAN BERNARDINO >> The San Bernardino County District Attorney determined the fatal shooting of a 34-year-old San Bernardino man by a police officer in October 2015 was justified, officials announced Thursday.

Around 3:30 p.m. Oct. 15, 2015, 911 operators received a call from a 7-year-old girl who said a man with a gun threatened to kill her father.

When San Bernardino police officers arrived on scene the victim pointed out two men. One of the men was cooperative with police while the other man, Joe Ortiz, who was presumed to be armed, fled from officers on a bicycle.

One of the officers chased Ortiz on foot through Seccombe Lake Park and into the alleyway south of Fifth Street, between Interocean Way and Waterman Avenue.

Officer Dominick Martinez was directed by another officer to “Stop the guy on the bike, black shirt,” the report states. Ortiz ignored police commands and led the police into an alley, and fell to the ground. He appeared to reach for something under his shirt.

Martinez fired out of fear that Ortiz was reaching for a gun. Ortiz died at the scene, and no gun was ever found.

“Officer Martinez claims he acted in self-defense because he actually and reasonably feared Ortiz was reaching for a gun,” the report says. “The evidence supports Officer Martinez’s claim of self-defense. Accordingly, this office declines to file criminal charges for the shooting.”

During the autopsy conducted on Ortiz, a toxicology analysis detected methamphetamine and cannabinoids in his system. Coroner’s officials said he was shot seven times and concluded the cause of death was multiple gunshot wounds.
