Mother wants answers about son’s death by deputy

BATH COUNTY, Ky. (WTVQ) – The mother of a man who was shot and killed by a Bath County sheriff’s deputy is speaking out.

Pamela Moore says two months later, her grief is worse because she’s still trying to figure out why her son had to be shot.

In April, KSP says Emory Moore was in a high speed chase with a Bath County sheriff’s deputy.

According to the medical examiner, Moore Ultimately stole a cruiser and deputy shot him once in his torso while he was in the car.

The chase ended on Lyons Road which is not far his mom’s house.

As she waits for answers, Moore wishes her son was still here.

“I would’ve rather seen him in jail then out here and what happened. I just can’t picture it,” said Pamela Moore.

State police are still investigating this case.
