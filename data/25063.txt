From staff reports

The Monroe County Sheriffâ€™s Office has released the names of the suspect and victim in Sunday's standoff in Hamlin.

Richard Paige, 62, stabbed his neighbor, Adam Burley, 36, in the chest with a knife, then retreated to his house, where, after a 10-hour standoff with authorities, he took his own life, deputies said.

Burley was transported to Strong Memorial Hospital, where he remains in guarded condition.

Deputies were sent to 56 Curtisdale Lane in Hamlin at 1:09 p.m. Sunday to respond to a report of a fight between two male neighbors.

After he stabbed Burley, Paige barricaded himself inside his home and was armed with long guns. The Sheriff's Office SWAT and hostage negotiation teams were in communication with Paige but he refused to leave the home and persisted with threats, deputies said. He died at midnight.

Area residents were alerted to the situation through 911 and its Hyper-Reach system. Residents were instructed to stay inside their homes and away from windows.
