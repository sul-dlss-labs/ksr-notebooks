BURBANK, Calif. (KABC) -- A suspected car thief is dead following an officer-involved shooting in Burbank after he led police on a chase that began in North Hollywood.

It all started when officers noticed the suspect driving erratically near the intersection of Magnolia Boulevard and Riverton Avenue. When officers tried to pull the driver over, the suspect stepped on the gas.

Los Angeles police said the suspect drove into a cul-de-sac in Burbank, where officers cornered him near National and Pass avenues around 1 a.m. Thursday.

Police initially said the suspect repeatedly rammed his vehicle into the passenger side of a patrol car, and that's when the shooting took place. However, officials later said the car collision was an accident.

Sir Giovanni witnessed the pursuit before it ended in the cul-de-sac.

"It was pretty shocking, actually, and scary," he said. "They obviously swarmed this car and I went back into the neighborhood to find out what was going on. I saw the chopper in the air and heard a gunshot."

Investigators said the suspect got out of the vehicle and tried to run off, but he only made it a few feet. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Witnesses told Eyewitness News that they heard anywhere from one to four gunshots. The LAPD have not confirmed if the suspect died from being hit by gunfire. The incident remains under investigation.

Following the shooting, LAPD determined that the suspect's vehicle was stolen. The suspect's identity was not immediately released, but was described as a Hispanic man in his 20s. Authorities also said he did not appear to be armed.

The officers in the patrol car involved in the crash sustained minor injuries. They were treated at the scene and released.
