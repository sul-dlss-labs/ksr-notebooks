Madison, WI: June 14, 2008. At approximately 1:00 a.m., 06-14-08, the Fitchburg police received a report of a disturbance at 2286 High Ridge Trail. The first Fitchburg Police Officer to arrive at the scene was confronted by an uncooperative and combative individual who was holding a length of coaxial cable. The officer used verbalized commands in an effort to calm the man down and also drew his Taser. The suspect knocked the Taser out of the officer's hand. Next, the suspect struck repeated blows about the officer's head and tried to disarm the officer. The officer was able to push the suspect away and fire one shot from his sidearm which fatally struck the suspect in the chest. The Fitchburg Police Department requested the assistance of the Dane County Sheriff's Office investigating this matter. Also participating in this investigation are the Dane County Coroner and Dane County District Attorney, who were present at the scene. The deceased is identified as Juan Manuel Avalos-Cisneros, age 27, from Fitchburg.
