SIDNEY — The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating an officer-involved shooting that occurred in Sidney Sunday.

Cheyenne County Attorney Paul Schaub has released that the shooting occurred after two Sidney Police Department officers were dispatched to a 911 call at a residence at 1363 Clark Drive. The officers saw a woman, identified as Leasa Hlavinka, running away from the house.

The officers entered the residence and confronted her husband, 44-year-old Dana Hlavinka, armed with a knife. Officers fatally shot Hlavinka. Leasa Hlavinka was taken to the Sidney hospital.

The Nebraska State Patrol is investigating and the Cheyenne County Sheriff’s Office is handling the coroner investigation.

Under state law, all shootings involving officers require the convening of a grand jury. Schaub said Judge Derek Weimer has appointed the Nebraska Attorney General's Office as special prosecutor to review the matter and convene a grand jury.
