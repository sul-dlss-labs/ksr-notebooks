A man who had felony warrants out for his arrest is dead after he shot and killed himself Friday during a SWAT standoff in Forsyth County, authorities said.

Deputies went to a home off Pittman Road in unincorporated Cumming to arrest 36- year-old Raymond Chad Hansard, sheriff’s office spokeswoman Stacie Miller told AJC.com.

They assisted the U.S. Marshals Service, which had warrants for Hansard’s arrest in connection with a probation violation and traffic charges related to a recent vehicle pursuit in which he successfully eluded law enforcement, Miller said.

When they tried to take him into custody, Hansard barricaded himself inside a neighbor’s house, she said. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

According to Georgia Department of Corrections records, Hansard served two stints in prison for a string of burglaries and intentionally set fires in Forsyth and Gwinnett counties.

According to multiple media reports, Hansard and another man were accused of setting dozens of fires to homes and businesses in the spring of 2004 and swiping valuables as they ran from the burning buildings. Hansard was 20 years old at the time.

He ended up serving a five-year sentence from 2006 to 2011 and another 2½ years behind bars from late 2013 to mid-2016, prison records show.
