Michael Phillip Uccello, a 48-year-old white man, was fatally shot by a U.S. Marshal on Thursday, Oct. 10, near the intersection of 10th Street West and Holguin Street in Lancaster, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

A U.S. Marshal Fugitive Apprehension Team with a South District of Ohio warrant accusing Uccello of conspiracy to traffic narcotics had been following the man that morning, said Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Brandon Dean.

When Uccello pulled into a gas station around 9 a.m., eight marshals tried to make a traffic stop to arrest him, Dean said. Uccello allegedly initially pulled over, but then quickly drove into a nearby residential area, he said, with the marshals in pursuit in seven different vehicles.

During the chase, Uccello struck two parked cars and a marshal's, causing his car to spin around. "It was such a tight space, it was a little like bumper cars," Dean said. "Once his car spun around, the officers assumed he would stop, so the officers got out of their car to detain him at gunpoint."

But Uccello apparently did not stop, and instead drove directly toward the officers, Dean said. One of the marshals, fearing for his colleagues, began shooting at Uccello, firing off eight to 10 shots, Dean said.

Uccello was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10:02 a.m., according to coroner's records. The cause of death was listed as multiple gunshot wounds.

Some residents were out on the street during the chase, Dean said, but no one else was injured.

Uccello was listed as a Sherman Oaks resident, according to coroner's records. Dean said investigators aren't sure why he was in Lancaster.
