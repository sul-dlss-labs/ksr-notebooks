TOLEDO, Ohio — Police say one person is dead and another is in critical condition after crashing a car into a central Toledo duplex late Tuesday night.

The crash happened on the 1600 block of Nebraska Avenue at Brown just before midnight.

Toledo police say they were attempting to stop the vehicle when the driver fled, leading police on a chase before crashing into the duplex. The vehicle ended upside down in the home.

The 20-year-old passenger was killed in the crash and the 27-year-old driver was taken to the hospital with serious injuries. Police say the names of those involved are being withheld pending notification of their families.

Toledo Fire and Rescue crews worked for nearly three hours to get the car out of the heavily damaged home. Firefighters used jacks and wood to make sure the building wouldn't collapse.

No one in the duplex was injured, but the building is not habitable due to the large hole in the side left by the car.

A 60-year-old woman who lives on the second story of the duplex had to be rescued by firefighters out of her bedroom window by climbing down a ladder. WTOL 11 talked to the woman's sister Vickie Ross, who said she was terrified.

"When I got here and they were bringing my sister out of the window, that was a scary feeling,” Ross said. "I'm just thankful to God that my sister's still here."

Crews say the woman was the only one in the home at the time of the crash. She had been living in the duplex for 16 years and now plans to live with her mother.
