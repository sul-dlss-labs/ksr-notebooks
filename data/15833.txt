The man shot multiple times during a late-night confrontation with a Baldwin County sheriff's deputy succumbed to his wounds Thursday, according to officials.

Authorities said Gilbert Fleury, 54, died at Baptist Hospital in Pensacola, Florida, one week after the shooting. The Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit is investigating the case.

"The Baldwin County Major Crimes Unit would like to extend our sympathy and prays to the family of Mr. Fleury," authorities said Friday in a news release.

According to the release, detectives are working with Florida law enforcement officials and planned to be present during Fleury's autopsy.

Officials did not say when the autopsy was expected to take place.

Anyone with information on the events leading up to the officer-involved shooting on March 11 can contact Lt. Rex Bishop with the Robertsdale Police Department or Detective Mike Gorum with the Daphne Police Department.

Late on March 11, Baldwin County sheriff's deputies Austin Welch, Brandon Brown and Nicholas Richerson responded to a report of a disorderly man who was apparently destroying his home in the Cliff's Landing area of Bay Minette. The man was identified as Fluery.

Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Hoss Mack said a neighbor reported that shots may have been fired in the area. When the deputies attempted to make contact with Fleury, he pointed a shotgun at one of the men and is believed to have gotten at least one shot off, he said.

A deputy opened fire and struck Fleury multiple times.
