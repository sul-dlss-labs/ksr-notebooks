BLANCHARD, LA (KSLA) - One man is dead and a Caddo Sheriff's deputy is on leave after a deputy-involved shooting Wednesday night in Blanchard.

Deputies confirm that 28-year-old Joseph Hanegan is dead. The deputy involved in the shooting will be placed on paid administrative leave, which is routine procedure, as the investigation continues.

The incident happened about 8:15 p.m., when deputies responded to a disturbance call at a residence on North Colony Drive in Blanchard near Dixie-Blanchard Road and Enchanted Lane.

Deputies say the call was about a man who had threatened to set himself on fire with a blowtorch as he sat in his vehicle on the front lawn of the residence.

Authorities say the first deputy to respond was the deputy involved in the shooting. A review of dashcam video reveals that Hanegan was sitting in a car with a woman. According to deputies, he told the deputy several times that he had a gun.

Hanegan then is said to have gotten out of his car and aimed what the deputy thought was a weapon.

The deputy fired three times, hitting him once. The weapon turned out to be a metal tool.

Deputies also say that the roof of the car had been burned. Deputies are still investigating what torched the roof.

There is no word yet on the woman's role in the incident and why Hanegan and the woman were in the car together.

Deputies, as of Wednesday night, still hadn't determined what prompted the shooting.

Hanegan's family members were at the residence when the incident occurred, but it's too early to tell who called 911.

Caddo deputies say this is not the first time that they've had to respond to the location, adding that they are familiar with the residence.

Crime scene investigators are at the scene, sweeping the area and looking for clues.
