Paul Aguilar, a 21-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy Friday, Nov. 15, in the 2400 block of Earle Avenue in Rosemead, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

Family members called deputies to the home about 6 p.m. because they said that Aguilar, who lived in a detached garage in the back of the home, had been drinking alcohol and was causing a disturbance, said Lt. Eddie Hernandez with the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

Family members said they would try to handle the situation, and deputies determined that Aguilar hadn’t broken any laws and left. About 10 minutes later, deputies were called again by family members who stated that Aguilar broke a television, Hernandez said.

Deputies spoke to Aguilar’s brother and a 26-year-old female family member who said she would walk back to the garage to try to calm Aguilar down.

Moments later, deputies heard, “He’s stabbing me, he’s stabbing me, he’s cut my throat,” Hernandez said.

Deputies went to the back of the home and saw that the woman’s throat had been cut and she had been stabbed in the back. Aguilar was approaching her from behind with a steak knife raised above his head.

A deputy fired one shot, and Aguilar was wounded in the chest. The woman was not in the line of fire, Hernandez said.

Aguilar was pronounced dead at the scene at 6:50 p.m. said Ed Winter, a coroner’s spokesman.

The woman was taken to the hospital and is expected to survive. A steak knife was recovered at the scene.
