BRISTOL, Va. — A special prosecutor will likely review the findings of an investigation being conducted by the Virginia State Police into a fatal, officer-involved shooting in Bristol Monday night.

The State Police continue to investigate the death of Paul B. Meade, 71, of Hillside Avenue. A neighbor heard Meade speaking about harming himself, so she called her husband, who then called 911, Bristol Virginia Police Department Capt. Maynard Ratcliff said Tuesday.

When police arrived, Meade was sitting in a wheelchair at the back of the house with a shotgun across his lap, Ratcliff said. Meade did not heed calls by police to drop the gun, instead pointing it toward two officers, who shot and killed him, he said.

The VSP will present its findings to Bristol Virginia Commonwealth’s Attorney Jerry Wolfe, who said Tuesday that a special prosecutor will likely review the findings.

Neighbors and police told the Bristol Herald Courier that Meade was ill.

Ratcliff said police have encountered Meade in the past, but he has no apparent criminal record in the city.

Monday’s officer-involved shooting was the first in the city since 2009, when an officer shot and injured a man at the Hickory Knoll Apartments during a domestic disturbance call.

In officer-involved shootings, Ratcliff said officers are placed on administrative leave and the Virginia State Police is called in to investigate.

Typically, the officers involved are offered counseling services.

Ratcliff noted that police administrators have been speaking with other police officers to make sure they have not been affected by the shooting.

“It can affect people who are not present,” Ratcliff said. “It can affect a lot of people.”

Meade’s body has been transported to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Roanoke for autopsy.

Ratcliff declined to identify the officers involved in the shooting.
