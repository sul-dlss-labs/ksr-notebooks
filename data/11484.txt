Later testing showed it was emitting higher voltage than manufacturer specifications.The family’s attorney, Al Gerhardstein, said North College Hill police agreed to change some of their Taser policies, including adding the manufacturer's preferred target zone and implementing reforms through a neutral expert, with input from Gerhardstein.One of the biggest reasons Corey McGinnis' family sued was to help improve Taser policies and training.Gerhardstein commended North College Hill police for agreeing to changes and hopes others will follow suit.“We're trying to get all 47 law enforcement agencies in Hamilton County to do the same thing,” Gerhardstein said.The family says the $650,000 settlement will help support Corey McGinnis’ eight children; however, his family said it was never about the money and the settlement two years after his death is bittersweet.Referring to Corey McGinnis’ ashes, Lisa McGinnis said, “We shouldn't have to talk to a box, we shouldn't have to.”The officer involved was investigated and cleared of any wrongdoing.
