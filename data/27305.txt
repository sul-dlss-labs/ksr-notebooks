SUWANNEE COUNTY, Fla. (WTXL) â€” A 15-year-old girl is dead after her mother lost control of her car while going more than 100 mph on I-75 in Suwannee County, crashing into several trees.

The Florida Highway Patrol says the crash happened around 1 a.m. Tuesday on I-75 North in Suwannee County.

Troopers say a 2006 Chrysler 300 was traveling north on I-75 when it was clocked by a trooper going 103 mph. Two troopers then began following the car, but they say the car began driving recklessly.

They say the driver passed on the emergency shoulder, made improper lane changes and continued going at speeds over 100 mph before abruptly getting off I-75 at the S.R. 47 exit.

The driver then got back onto I-75 north and kept driving, troopers saying the driver refused to stop for law enforcement who had their emergency lights activated.

FHP says the driver again got off I-75, this time at the C.R. 136 exit in Suwannee County. However, the driver lost control of the car, crashing into several pine trees on the shoulder.

Troopers say the driver's daughters, a 15-year-old and a 17-year-old, were with her at the time of the crash. The 15-year-old was killed in the crash while the 17-year-old suffered minor injuries.

The driver, a 34-year-old woman, was taken to UF Shands in serious condition.

It's unknown at this time if the crash was alcohol related. Troopers say the 15-year-old girl was the only person wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash.

FHP says charges are pending investigation.
