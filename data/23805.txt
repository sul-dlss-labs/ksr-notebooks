A 24-year-old Memphis man shot and killed himself after a police chase in DeSoto County on Wednesday morning, according to the DeSoto County Sheriff's Department.

In the car with him was a juvenile whom authorities were seeking.

Authorities Wednesday afternoon confirmed the victim's identity as Wesley Andrew Brandon. His body was sent to Jackson for an autopsy.

Chief Inspector Roger Hutchins said the sheriff's department assisted Hernando police in the chase within the Hernando city limits. Police pursued the vehicle because of a broadcast concerning an endangered juvenile from out of state.

"The suspect eluded Hernando officers and eventually wrecked his vehicle at the intersection of Slocum and McCracken Road," Hutchins said. "At this time, the suspect driver produced a firearm and shot himself."

Brandon was taken to the hospital, but later died of the self-inflicted wound. The juvenile was unharmed and taken into protective custody.

No additional details are being released at this time.
