A domestic dispute in Lake Park ended in a man's suicide Wednesday night, according to Naples police.

Naples police received a call around 7 p.m. Wednesday about a fight taking place between a man and woman in the street in front of their home.

When police officers and fire-rescue got to the scene, the man ran into his house. As medical personnel treated the woman for minor injuries, police heard a gunshot fired, Naples Police Chief Tom Weschler said.

The man was in his 70s and the woman was in her 50s.

A SWAT team was called and went into the house to make sure the scene was safe. They found the man had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Weschler said.
