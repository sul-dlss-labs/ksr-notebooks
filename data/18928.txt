(Moncks Corner-AP) July 13, 2006 - State investigators say a Berkeley County sheriff's deputy was justified in shooting and killing a domestic violence suspect who stabbed another deputy last month.

Forty-five-year-old Joel Terron Rueda was killed June 11th after he stabbed Deputy Danny Jones in the left armpit during a domestic dispute call in Ladson.

Jones and Corporal Brian O'Rourke fired at Rueda. An incident report states the shots fired by O'Rourke hit Rueda in the lower back and chest.

Jones was hospitalized for two days.

He and O'Rourke were given administrative duties until the State Law Enforcement Division finished investigating the shooting.

Sheriff's Major Ricky Driggers says SLED determined Rueda's death was justifiable homicide and both deputies returned to patrol Wednesday.
