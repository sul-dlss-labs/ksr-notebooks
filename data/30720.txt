Seattle Police on Friday released bodycam and dashcam footage showing the deadly shooting of a homicide suspect near White Center. Police said they were forced to fire when serving a search warrant when the man came out of the home and fired at officers.

Police and SWAT were called to a home on 21st Ave. SW just around 5:45 p.m. to serve an arrest warrant for a suspect wanted out of Seattle for a homicide that occurred earlier in the year.

Officers used a PA system from outside the house to tell the suspect to surrender when a man came outside, allegedly armed with a handgun.

"We believe from the preliminary reports that he actually fired upon officers," Seattle Assistant Police Chief Deanna Nolette said.

Police later said three officers returned fire, striking the man.

Officers used flash-bang devices when they went inside to clear the residence, she said. Police attempted life-saving efforts, but the Seattle Fire Department declared the 22-year-old man dead at the scene, she said.

The involved officers were placed on paid administrative leave in accordance with SPD policy while the investigation is ongoing.

Seattle Police released bodycam video of the incident late Friday. It is SPD's policy to release video of the incident within 72 hours.

As with all police shootings, it will be investigated by Seattle police's Force Investigations Team (FIT) with oversight from the Office of Professional Accountability (OPA) and the Office of the Inspector General.

This is the first deadly officer-involved shooting since Washington state enacted stricter use-of-force rules for police.
