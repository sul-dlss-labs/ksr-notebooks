A 32-year-old armed man, who refused to comply with police commands, died yesterday after he was shot by police officers responding to a domestic disturbance in Renton.

The shooting ended a 12-hour standoff at the man's estranged wife's home.

Renton police investigators responded to a call at 5:30 a.m. in the 1900 block of Queen Avenue Northeast. A 24-year-old woman, who is the man's estranged wife, summoned the neighbors for help.

Renton police spokeswoman Penny Bartley said officers went to the house to arrest the armed man for felony violation of a no contact order and suspicion of burglary, but he managed to barricade himself inside the home.

Police spent most of the morning speaking with the man, but he stopped responding to negotiators by the afternoon.

At 3:30 p.m. police sent a Port of Seattle robot with a camera into the home but failed to find the man. Police then tossed in canisters of pepper spray and tear gas to try to force him out. At 5 p.m. a team of six King County law enforcement agencies entered the home.

Investigators said officers found him hiding in the attic, armed with a handgun, and he refused to comply with commands. It is unclear what the commands were. Investigators said the man was shot multiple times by a Tukwila police officer on the team.

The man was taken to Harborview Medical Center, where he later died.
