A man with a gun was shot and killed by a plainclothes police officer in a busy courtyard after a quick chase through a housing complex in Harlem late Friday, the police said.

The man, Ronald Battle, 25, died after being shot once in the lower back, according to the police, who said two officers had chased him between buildings at the Ralph J. Rangel Houses on Harlem River Drive. The police said Mr. Battle had been holding a gun, a 9-millimeter semiautomatic Ruger, that was found at the scene, loaded with one round in its chamber. Some witnesses, however, insisted that there was no gun in Mr. Battleâ€™s hand.

The police said that the two plainclothes officers were responding to a 911 call from a woman who lives at Rangel Houses and reported, around 11 p.m., that two men were walking around the complex with guns.

When the officers approached the men, who were wearing hooded sweatshirts, the men started to run away. It was unclear when the officers saw the gun they said Mr. Battle was holding.
