HOME INVASION: One man was arrested and another injured in a home invasion and assault early Tuesday. Michigan State Police at Marshall reported the incident at 6:15 a.m. in the 4000 block of 9 1/2 Mile Road in Burlington Township. Troopers said the suspect, a man, 26, from Burlington attempted to break into a home. The resident, 38, and known to the suspect, attempted to stop the home invasion and a struggle began. A second man, 22, from Litchfield, was armed with a handgun and went to the aid of the resident and struck the burglar with the butt of the handgun. The burglary suspect then choked the Litchfield man until he was unconscious. The Litchfield man was taken to the hospital in Coldwater for treatment and is expected to recover. A woman, 20, and infant, also at the home, were not injured. The suspect was taken to the Calhoun County jail on charges of assault less than murder and home invasion. Troopers were assisted by Calhoun County Sheriff Department deputies.

SELF-INFLICTED SHOOTING: A 43-year-old Springfield man died after shooting himself despite efforts by deputies from the Calhoun County Sheriff Department to convince him to put down the gun. Deputies were called to Wyndtree Apartments in Springfield at 8:20 p.m. for a man with a gun. Deputies found the man with a gun and determined his girlfriend and children had fled and were with neighbors. Deputies talked with the man about 45 minutes, trying to convince him to put down the gun. When talking appeared futile, deputies shot the man with beanbag rounds but instead of giving up, the man went into the apartment but then returned and continued to talk with deputies. Deputies tried to use beanbags a second time but the man did not give up the gun and a short time later shot himself. He died later at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Kalamazoo.
