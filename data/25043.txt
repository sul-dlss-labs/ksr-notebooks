Officers used home security cameras and talked to witnesses to track the suspect to the house, Wiesman said.

“Officers went to the address, went inside the actual address — the residents were cooperative. The individual was in a back bedroom, they asked the individual to come out. At that time a shot rang out.

“Officers didn’t know if the person was shooting at them or where they were shooting so they evacuated the house. We surrounded it and as it turned out the subject inside was deceased,” Wiesman said.

The incident remains under investigation.
