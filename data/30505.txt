The Texas Rangers are taking over investigation of a shooting incident involving the Canyon Police Department early Friday morning, after the death of a suspect.

According to the Canyon Police Department (Canyon PD), two officers stopped a vehicle for a traffic violation around 12:30 a.m. on June 25, at Hunsley and FM 2590.
