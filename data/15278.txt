17-year-old killed after running into path of North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper's car in Fayetteville

FAYETTEVILLE (WTVD) -- A 17-year-old is dead after being hit by a North Carolina State Highway Patrol trooper's car in Fayetteville.

It happened around 7:45 p.m. Monday on the All American Freeway near the Cliffdale Road interchange.

Investigators say Trooper B. J. Holder was traveling south on the All American Freeway towards Cape Fear Valley Medical Center to finish an accident report when Christopher Mason McCray, of Emmerson Grove Court, ran into the roadway and into the path of his vehicle.

McCray, a Cape Fear High School student, died at the scene. Holder was not hurt.

Troopers say it is unclear why McCray ran into the travel lane of the patrol vehicle. He was wearing dark clothing.

Investigators say preliminary evidence shows Trooper Holder was not at fault in the accident, but they continue to look into how it happened.

Police are investigating what happened before the 17-year-old was hit and killed.

Counselors were at Cape Fear High School Tuesday helping students deal with the loss.
