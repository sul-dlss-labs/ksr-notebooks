LADY LAKE, Fla. â€“ A man died on Friday following an altercation with two deputies at the Sumter County Sheriff's Office that saw the deputies shoot the man.

The incident stemmed from a domestic dispute between Anthony Coleman, 38, and his wife in Lady Lake on Friday.

Deputies responded to a call regarding a domestic dispute at NE 105th Lane, and then met the wife at a local church, who told deputies Coleman had punched their dog in the face three times.

Capt. Tony Prevatt of the Sumter County Sheriff's Office said the wife told him that Coleman started acting strange, shooting a gun in the air 10 times and firing at people's dogs in the neighborhood. Prevatt said the wife also told him that Coleman shot one dog and dragged it to the house.

The wife fled the scene with her children and while police were interviewing her, deputies responded to gunshots heard nearby.

Deputies said they confronted Coleman, who then raised a firearm at deputies. The two deputies then fired shots and struck Coleman, who has taken to Ocala Regional Medical Center. He later died.
