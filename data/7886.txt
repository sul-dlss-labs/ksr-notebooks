The death of a Shakopee man at the hands of police over the weekend was the final stage in a deeply troubled marriage headed for divorce, court records show.

Jennifer Denmark accused her husband of an assault in September serious enough to make her feel she could be killed. But "there is a history well before then," her attorney, Kristine Anderson, said Monday. "It has been volatile for the entire duration. She tells me, 'It was 17 years and I still love him and I am grieving for him.'"

A long-delayed pretrial hearing in a criminal case against Gordon William (Bill) Denmark, 36, for assault and other charges was scheduled for March 3. On Friday, Shakopee police were summoned to the home where Jennifer Denmark was living, only to hear of another assault, from which she had escaped and after which her estranged husband, who police said was carrying a knife, had fled.

With a search for him still on, they returned with her to the house on Saturday and found signs of a break-in. Police told her to stay in the car while they went through the home, her attorney said. Police say they found the estranged husband hiding in an attic space off a bedroom. They ordered him to drop a knife he was holding, they said, Tasered him without effect and shot him to death when he continued to wield the knife.

Shakopee police did not return calls seeking comment about the shooting on Monday. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating.

Bill Denmark's attorney, James Hanvik, said Monday that Jennifer Denmark cooked up the original charges to remove her husband from a troubled marriage, saying she spent time with him after she leveled the assault charges.

"You'd think it would be difficult to put aside if someone were so traumatized and frightened," he said.

But it does not seem possible, he conceded, to dispute that his client turned up at her place over the weekend and was carrying a knife.
