The Nueces County Medical Examiner's office identified a 26-year-old man who was shot in the head by his 32-year-old cousin, who later turned the gun on himself.

About 3:15 a.m. Sunday officers responded to a shooting at the Misty Winds Trailer Park. When they arrived, they found Benny Vela, 26, dead in the driveway next to a trailer on Gentle Breeze, police said.

Witnesses told officers Jacob Vela, who was Benny Vela's cousin, shot him in the head after an argument and left in his 2016 Chevy Silverado pickup. About 15 minutes later an officer saw the pickup at the intersection of Power and North Chaparral streets Downtown, police said.

The officer followed the pickup onto the Harbor Bridge, then North Beach and the Nueces Bay Causeway. Police said the officer did not try to stop the pickup because there were no other patrol units in the area for backup.

As the officer followed Jacob Vela into Portland and Gregory Vela turned to State Highway 35 toward Aransas Pass. While on that highway the officer tried to stop the vehicle with the help of other officers. On County Road 91A the pickup veered off the roadway and rolled into a field knocking down power lines.

When officers approached the pickup they saw him shoot himself in the head. He was taken to Christus Spohn Hospital Memorial, where he later died.
