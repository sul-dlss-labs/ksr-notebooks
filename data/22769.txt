UPDATE 1:30 p.m. Saturday

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is investigating an officer-involved shooting in Sun City, Kansas.

The shooting happened around 7:30 p.m. Friday night.

According to a press release from the KBI, Barber County Sheriff's Office received a call around 6:30 p.m. about a man threatening individuals with a gun outside a bar on Main St. in Sun City, Kansas.

When deputies arrived, other people in the area said the man left.

Deputies searched several locations and properties looking for the man and eventually found him in a shed in the 200 block of W Main St.

KBI says when the man exited the shed, he did not comply with commands from the deputies on scene.

At that time, one deputy fired a less-lethal bean bag round towards the man, hitting him.

Both law enforcement officers and EMS on scene attempted to save the man; however, despite first responders' efforts, the man died.

KBI identifies the man as Steven Myers, 42 of Sun City.

No law enforcement officers were injured in the incident.

The KBI plans to continue investigating the shooting. Once the investigation concludes, findings will be turned over to the Barber County Attorney for review.
