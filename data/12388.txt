Anchorage Police shot and killed a man they were pursuing earlier Tuesday. The man who died is 25 year old Carl Richard Bowie the III of Anchorage.

The incident started around 10 a.m. when the Anchorage Police Department received a call about a man prowling around cars at the Dimond Center parking lot. Officers followed the man who was driving a truck that was reported stolen from a southwest Anchorage neighborhood Tuesday morning. Officers attempted to stop the vehicle but the driver continued into a residential neighborhood in South Anchorage. Anchorage Police Chief Mark Mew says that’s when officers fired.

“The suspect vehicle apparently turned around the cul-de-sac, rammed a patrol car, then rammed another patrol car and at some point two officers fired at the vehicle and driver, both were struck. The vehicle lost control and ended up in its current position in a driveway. The driver was killed,” Mew said.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene at 10:52 a.m. A female passenger inside the vehicle was uninjured and was taken into custody. This case is still under investigation. The police department’s policy is not to release the names of the officers involved in the shooting for three days.
