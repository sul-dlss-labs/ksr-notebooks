FAR SOUTH SIDE â€” An off-duty Chicago police officer fatally shot a man who threatened to kill her while attempting to break into her vehicle Wednesday night in the city's Roseland neighborhood on the Far South Side.

The Gresham District officer was sitting in the vehicle at a stop sign at 109th Street and Wentworth Avenue at about 7:45 p.m. when the man jumped up onto the hood, said Chicago Police Department spokesman Pat Camden.

"He told her, `I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna kill you!' and she backs up her vehicle and he slides off the hood," he said.

The officer tried to drive around him, but he jumped onto her hood again, Camden said.

He tried to enter the vehicle through the sunroof and the officer drew her gun, Camden said. She told him that she was a police officer, but the man reached for the gun, Camden said. She then fired several shots at him, Camden said.

The man, described as in his late 20s or early 30s, was shot in the chest and died at the scene, authorities said. The officer was not hurt.

Calumet Area detectives and the Police Department's Office of Professional Standards are investigating, Camden said.
