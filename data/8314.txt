AT 9:11 P.M.: A man with a history of violence is dead and an officer is injured after a shooting Friday morning on the Centennial Bridge.

Steven Tyrone Mallory, 39, of Davenport, died after he was shot by Davenport police officer Clif Anderson about 11:20 a.m., Police Chief Frank Donchez said. Anderson, 41, is recovering from his injuries.

The incident began when the Davenport officer stopped the suspect in the middle of the bridge to question him regarding an assault 15 minutes earlier at the Cafe on Vine coffee shop, a free meal site at 932 W. 6th St., officials said.

The victim of the assault was a 53-year-old Scott County man who was volunteering at the cafe. The volunteer was hit on the head and taken to Genesis Medical Center-West Central Park, Davenport, for treatment of injuries. A citizen followed the suspect to the Centennial Bridge.

Anderson, a 14-year veteran of the force, crossed the bridge, turned around in Rock Island and then returned to talk to Mallory in the middle of the span.

Anderson told Mallory to get down on his knees several times, orders that Mallory did not heed, according to police officials and video released Friday. The officer deployed his Taser, which appeared to have no effect on the suspect because one of the two prongs missed him and the electrical connection was not completed, Davenport police Capt. David Struckman said.

Mallory then attacked Anderson, punching the officer, biting the officer's face and slamming the officer's head against the concrete, officials said. The suspect was on top of the officer and choking him when East Moline police Det. Jim Weakley arrived on the scene.

The Davenport police officer unholstered his gun and shot the suspect, Donchez said. Officials declined to say how many times the suspect was shot. They released a portion of the video taken from the police car. However, officials chose to stop the video portion before the shooting occurred.

Police said they believed Mallory was unarmed.

Both men were taken to Genesis Medical Center, East Rusholme Street, Davenport. Mallory died there. Anderson was released after treatment of injuries to his head and torso.

Struckman credited Weakley with saving Anderson from further harm or worse.

"His quick action, without hesitation, undoubtedly saved officer Anderson from serious injury or death and he needs to be commended for taking that action," Struckman said.

"We extend a collective 'thank you' from the Davenport Police Department to detective Weakley and the East Moline Police Department."

The incident closed the Centennial Bridge for several hours.

The Scott County Sheriff's Office will be the lead agency investigating the incident, assisted by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation, officials said. An internal review also is under way.

Mallory's record of violence goes back several years.

He went to prison in the mid-1990s on drug and assault charges. The assault was against three Davenport police officers who went to Mallory's home to arrest him for an earlier assault. He refused to be handcuffed. Officers sprayed him with pepper spray, and Mallory charged at the officers. In the ensuing fight, one officer received a bruised back, broken glasses, a scraped arm and a bite on his arm. A second officer was cut on the head. A third officer's thumb was smashed.

More recently, according to police records, Mallory was charged with two counts of domestic assault in January after he hit his aunt in the face, which caused her to fall and break her hip. He was living with her at the time. He then beat his cousin, who attempted to intervene, chasing him around the house, kicking him in the chest and stomach, police said.

The last fatal officer-involved shooting in Davenport was in 2007, records show. Frank Elfgen was shot in February 2007 after officers responded to a call about Elfgen threatening to kill himself at his home.

Officer Jonathan Tatum tried to use a stun gun to incapacitate Elfgen but was not successful. Elfgen tried to take a swipe at Officer William Hurt with the knife, and the officers backed out of the room with Elfgen pursuing them.

Elfgen then charged at Jason Ellerbach, who was backed into a corner. Ellerbach fired his weapon three times striking Elfgen twice. Hurt fired two rounds striking Elfgen two times. At the time, six officers were in the small room or nearby.
