ST. CHARLES COUNTY • A 21-year-old man who was intoxicated and threatening to commit suicide was fatally shot Saturday after he pointed a handgun at a deputy who responded to the scene, police said.

The man, Anthony Kovac, of Raytown, Mo., died of his injuries at a hospital. Kovac was visiting his grandparents at their home in the 2000 block of Old Highway 79 at the time of the incident.

According to St. Charles County Sheriff’s Lt. Dave Tiefenbrunn, four deputies arrived at the home about 8:30 p.m. Kovac was in a back bedroom, and officers gathered in a narrow hallway and planned to try to talk Kovac out of the room.

Two of them had less-lethal weapons: a Taser and a gun that fires beanbag rounds.

“But before they could do anything, he came out wielding a small-caliber handgun,” Tiefenbrunn said.

Kovac refused to drop the firearm, and he drew the gun up and pointed it in the direction of one of the officers, Tiefenbrunn said. The officer fired several shots.

“They were going to try to talk him out and get him to drop the gun and seek medical help,” Tiefenbrunn said. “When we get in a situation like that, some of the officers have lethal force just in case like what happened here did happen.”

The officer involved in the shooting is 29 and has been with the department for 18 months, Tiefenbrunn said. He has an extensive military background.

The shooting appears to be justified, Tiefenbrunn said, but as a matter of routine, the deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave until an investigation is completed.
