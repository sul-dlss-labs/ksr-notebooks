According to Cambria, they spoke on the phone briefly and exchanged, "I love you's" before the fatal encounter.

Just before 6 a.m. Friday, members of the Regional Task Force were attempting to take Tyree into custody in connection with a federal probation warrant.

"We're still investigating the reason for the parole violation, but I believe it was something minor -- not murder or anything," Cambria said.

When the task force approached the front door, they observed thick smoke coming from the apartment and notified the FDNY.

Responding firefighter Lt. James Hayes was then shot twice before an officer shot back once and removed Hayes from the scene, Bratton said.

Hayes was taken to Richmond University Medical Center in West Brighton and is expected to make a full recovery.

"I think he's in very good spirits," FDNY Commissioner Daniel Nigro said. "I think he realizes that he came very close to not being with us and seeing his family. He's very happy.
