Neighbors say they watched first responders cut someone out of the car.

"Came outside to look and saw that car down there smoking and the police were closing in on it," said Steve King.

"It was really loud, like a really sudden thud and metal crashing," said Carly Siege.

"The officer followed the vehicle from a distance. The vehicle attempted to make a left turn at the intersection of Shade and Florence and it looks like it lost control and hit a telephone pole," said county homicide Lt. Venerando Costa.
