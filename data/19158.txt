Names have been released of the two teenagers who died after prosecutors say they stole an SUV, then crashed during a police pursuit in South Bend.

The teens who died are identified as 16-year-old Samuel Phillips and 15-year-old Jermaine Fleming. Fleming died at the scene while Phillips died at the hospital. The two were brothers.

A third teen suffered broken bones while a fourth was ejected from the vehicle when it hit the garage. He suffered a head injury. Both are in stable condition.

The chase and collision happened early Tuesday morning. Police say the teens stole the vehicle which was left running, warming up, unattended from the 1500 block of Lincolnway.

The crash happened at a detached garage near the intersection of Humboldt and College.

“This was at tragedy to everyone involved, including the officers, EMT folks, and neighbors,” Cotter said. “This is a horrible thing that anyone has to go through. Our hearts who were involved, but the officers had to do their job.”

Cotter says no charges will be filed for fleeing from police, but didn’t say if other charges could be filed.
