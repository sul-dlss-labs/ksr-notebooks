[April 11, 2012] Sheriff and deputy shoot, kill man in Newton County Tweet

VIDOR, Apr 11, 2012 (The Orange Leader - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- A man with weapons was shot and killed after threatening law enforcement personnel Tuesday morning.



Sheriff Joe Walker of Newton County issued a press release Tuesday afternoon stating James Weldon was shot and killed earlier that day after he "drew weapons" and threatened Walker and Sgt. Matthews.



Information provided by the Newton County Sheriff's Office stated both Walker and Matthews responded to a disturbance at approximately 10 a.m., Tuesday, at an undisclosed address on County Road 2116, which is approximately six miles east of Burkeville.







Neighbors had reported the man, James Weldon, was armed and had already told the neighbors to "get out of the area" because "he had bombs and booby traps." Sheriff Walker and Sgt. Matthews made contact with Weldon, at which point, according to the press release, Weldon "drew weapons on the Sheriff and Sergeant." Walker and Matthews both reportedly fired upon Weldon, striking and killing him. Weldon was pronounced dead by Brenda Smith, Newton County Justice of the Peace, Precinct 2 at 10:46 a.m., Tuesday.



The Newton County Sheriff's Office notified the Texas Rangers of the situation as well.





Also, the department of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms was contacted as explosive devices were determined to be on Weldon's property. Bomb technicians were called in to defuse any potential explosive devices.



No other details were immediately available.
