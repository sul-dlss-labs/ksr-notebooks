GUNTERSVILLE - A man found dead after an early morning shooting today here has been identified as Justin Lane Kelley, 20, according to Marshall County Coroner Marlon Killion.

Killion said Kelley's body was sent to a state forensics laboratory in Huntsville for an autopsy.

Guntersville Police Chief Jim Peterson said the man's body was found in a bedroom at his father's mobile home at 602 Dixon Road after an officer fired into the room after hearing a gunshot.

Peterson said the officer and another officer, whom he declined to name, were responding to a 911 domestic disturbance call of a man with a gun in the home when a shot was fired and the officer fired shots through the bedroom wall and open door. The incident occurred about 3 a.m., he said.

Peterson said he could not say whether the officer could see the man inside the bedroom and if the man was struck by the officer's gunfire. But he said "it's entirely possible" the man's death was a suicide.

At the time of the shooting, Peterson said, the man's girlfriend was also in the bedroom and that his father and another woman were in the kitchen.

Because his officer had fired his gun, Peterson said he turned the investigation over to the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. He said the officer has been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.
