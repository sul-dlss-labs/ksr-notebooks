HPD patrol officers responded to an assault call at a residence at the above address. Officers arrived and found a male suspect acting combative and restrained on the ground by his family members. The suspect was taken into custody, with assistance from the suspect's brother, without incident. The suspect was then placed in a patrol vehicle and transported to the hospital to be treated for injuries he sustained while his brother attempted to subdue him.



Upon arriving at the hospital, the suspect was escorted out of the patrol vehicle, at which time his condition worsened. He later died at the hospital. Family members later told investigators the suspect had a history of narcotics use.
