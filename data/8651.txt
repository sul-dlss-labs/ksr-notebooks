CALDWELL, Idaho -- Officials say police in Caldwell shot and killed a 40-year-old man while attempting to serve an arrest warrant for a parole violation as well as a search warrant for suspected firearms theft.



Nampa Deputy Police Chief Craig Kingsbury said David Valdez Banda died at the scene Wednesday night.



During a press conference this morning, Kingsbury said Banda had a lengthy criminal history and was holding a handgun when he came out of the home and made an aggressive move, refusing orders to drop the weapon.



"I'm very confident the officers reacted the way they're trained," Caldwell Police Chief Chris Allgood said. "It's tough for me because I care deeply for these officers, and I know they're having a difficult time, as well as the family of Mr. Banda -- I know they're suffering. I want to assure them that they will get answers when this is done."



The Canyon/Owyhee County Critical Incident Task Force is investigating the fatal shooting.



Police say they were trying to serve an arrest warrant for Banda, who was wanted on a parole violation, when the shooting occurred. Officials refused to say how many officers fired on Banda and how many shots were fired, but several officers are on paid administrative leave, a standard procedure after an officer-involved shooting.



Officers said it is too early in the investigation to speculate whether Banda, 40, wanted police to shoot him, but Banda's sisters said he made a phone call that indicated he expected to die.



"He called my husband and told him to tell us he loves us, and this was the end for him," Banda's sister Irene Prieto told The Idaho Statesman. "He was too afraid to go back to prison."



Four others in the home, including three children, were not injured, police said.



Wednesday's fatal shooting is the fourth officer-involved shooting in Canyon County this year and the first in Caldwell.
