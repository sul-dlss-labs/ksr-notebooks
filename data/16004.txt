Crime & Safety Police Continue To Look For Suspects, Vehicles in Outlet Mall Burglary Two suspects led officers on a high-speed chase that ended with a fatal wreck in southwest Cherokee County. Reply

Detectives with the Woodstock Police Department continue to look for additional suspects and vehicles possibly connected to an early morning burglary that ended in a fatal high-speed pursuit. Officers believe there are four to six other individuals of interest related to the burglary, which occurred during the pre-dawn hours Monday at True Religion Brand Jeans at the Outlet Shoppes at Atlanta.

Woodstock police spokesperson Brittany Duncan said investigators also believe the suspects are not from the area. Investigators are also looking for a white passenger car and a dark-colored SUV as possible vehicles involved in the incident. “Detectives are still working to gather more information,” she said.

Officers responded around 4:43 a.m. April 20 to a burglary call at the store, which is at 915 Ridgewalk Parkway. Duncan said evidence suggests a van “was backed into the glass of the store to gain access.” That action caused extensive damage to the store, and the suspects were able to make off with an undisclosed amount of merchandise.

The suspects involved allegedly “fled from the scene after security approached them,” Duncan stated. A description of three vehicles involved was given to patrol units. Duncan stated one of the vehicle was “spotted driving erratically,” almost striking two other vehicles, before exiting Interstate 575 at Highway 92.
