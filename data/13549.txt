One person died after a short chase from the city of Meridian into Lauderdale County Monday afternoon.

Coroner Clayton Cobler identified the man Tuesday as 33-year-old Jason Stevens of Meridian.

Mississippi Department of Public Safety spokesman Warren Strain confirmed the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is looking into the death but would not release any other information.

The chase happened a little before 2 p.m. Monday when a Meridian police officer tried to make a traffic stop, and the driver took off near Old 8th Street Road. The driver lost control of his car just outside city limits on North Lakeland Drive and went into a ditch.

Sgt. Dareall Thompson says multiple passengers bailed out of the car and ran away while the officer tried to arrest the driver. Chief Deputy Ward Calhoun says a Mississippi Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks officer came by and tried to help the officer. There was a struggle to take the man into custody while the subject tried to get into the Wildlife and Fisheries truck.

The man was finally arrested and put in the back of an MPD vehicle. Calhoun says sometime later, an officer realized the man was in distress. He was taken to the emergency room and later declared dead. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is now handling the investigation.
