One person is dead and a Harrison County Sheriff's deputy is in the hospital after a shoot-out in Gulfport Satruday afternoon. It happened at the Crystal Inn off of I-10 and Canal Road.

Check out time at the Crystal Inn in Gulfport is 12, noon. Manager Stephanie Wilson said it's her policy to call police when any guest refuses to leave. Saturday, she enforced the policy.

Two sheriff's deputies arrived at about 12:50 p.m. They went up to the guest's room, asked for ID, but instead of an ID the man produced a gun.

"There was an exchange of gunfire between the two deputies and the subject. The subject was deceased at the scene," Harrison County Sheriff George Payne said.

AMR rushed the wounded deputy to Garden Park Hospital where he underwent surgery. Sheriff George Payne helped console the family at the hospital.

"Well it was tense, especially when the deputies wife and children get there. They didn't know his condition, they just knew he'd been shot, but we got a good strong support team, took care of the situation. The local hospital treated him, the staff, were excellent," Sheriff Payne said.

Many fellow officers and friends stood by and waited for the prognosis.

"This is a big family, law enforcement, and they take care of each other, real proud of that. Thank God this deputy wasn't hurt worse than he was," Payne said.

Late Saturday night, Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove identified that the shooter is 26-year-old, James Taylor, Jr. of Wilmer, AL.

The name of the deputies involved will not be released until after the case is reviewed by a grand jury.
