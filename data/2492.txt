A plainclothes narcotics detective shot and killed a Brooklyn man yesterday afternoon minutes after he saw him fatally shoot another man on a crowded Bedford-Stuyvesant street, the police said. It was the second fatal police shooting in Brooklyn in two days, and it sparked a series of tense confrontations through the afternoon between friends of the man killed by the police and officers who were guarding the crime scene.

In one instance, several young men stood nose to nose with the officers, their faces contorted in rage, screaming threats and shouting obscenities and later violently kicking the sides of patrol cars. Earlier in the afternoon, shortly after the shooting, wailing and inconsolable relatives of the man, who lived nearby, were hugging police community affairs officers.

But police officials said that a preliminary investigation had found that the shooting, like the killing of a 28-year-old man by a police officer on Wednesday in nearby Fort Greene, was within police guidelines. That man had been shot after firing a gun in the air, apparently to celebrate a friend's birthday.

At a news conference yesterday, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly played halting images from a security camera videotape. Mr. Kelly said the tape showed the man who was killed by the detective firing a gun into the lobby of 685 Gates Avenue at 1:30 p.m., and, moments later, a second man staggering out. That man, who later died, was identified as James Hodge, 21, also known as James Oxendine.
