A man who was shot by a Fort Myers police officer on Saturday has died.

The man, who has not been officially identified, was shot after he fired at officers responding to a call at Mahogany's Beauty Salon, 3440 Fowler St., about 11:30 a.m. Saturday after multiple shots were reportedly fired.

In a news release Monday, police called him "clinically dead."

Police said the man apparently shot his wife at the salon and exchanged fire with police before being shot himself. Police cited Florida's Marsy's Law in not identifying the victim or the suspect.

However, Sunday friends working at the salon identified Mahogany Mouzon, 41, as the victim and her husband, Ronnel Mouzon, 41, as the shooter.

Mahogany Mouzon's friends also said the woman had been shot 17 times but was recovering. Police said the victim is alive and being treated at Lee Memorial Hospital.

Jama Jeangilles, who was helping several other friends and co-workers of Mouzon clean up the Fowler Street salon, confirmed that it was Mahogany who was the victim on Saturday.

"She's going to be just fine," she said.

A gofundme account has been set up for Mahogany Mouzon's recovery, friends said.

Fort Myers police directed questions about the shooting to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which is investigating the incident, or the State Attorneyâ€™s Office.

The State Attorney's Office also referred questions to the FDLE.

An FDLE representative confirmed that FDLE is investigating the officer-involved shooting but city the case's active status and declined to provide details.
