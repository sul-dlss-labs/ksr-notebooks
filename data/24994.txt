The man who died in a gunfight with police Wednesday died of a gunshot wound that was not self-inflicted, the Cowlitz County Coroner’s Office concluded after an autopsy that ended Thursday afternoon.

The finding likely means that transient Weston Willow Well Cole, 29, died from a shot or shots fired by Longview police and Cowlitz County sheriff’s deputies in a shootout at the El Patio Mobile Home Park in the 600 block of California Way.

Coroner Tim Davidson declined to say how many shots struck Cole. He ruled the death a homicide, which in this case means he died at someone else’s hand, not his own.

“This is homicide as a medical finding,” Davidson clarified. “It does not in any way establish criminal intent.”

A toxicology report was submitted, but results are not expected for five to six months, Davidson said, due to a backlog at the Washington State Toxicology Lab.

Police were called to the park on a report of an unwanted subject just before 3 a.m. According to Longview PD, Cole barged into an occupied home and then began firing at officers. The residents fled and Cole then engaged in a brief gunfight with police.

Cole two years earlier had threatened to kill a police officer, according to police records.

When arrested on suspicion of shoplifting in 2016, he told a Kelso officer that he wanted the officer and the officer’s family to die “slow and painful deaths.” Cole told that officer, “You are the cop that people shoot and kill,” according to his probable cause statement, and “you are lucky I’m in jail, because I would get you.”

He was convicted of threatening to use force against a police officer with a deadly weapon along with third-degree theft, obstructing a law enforcement officer, and a felony drug offense. He served one year in prison.
