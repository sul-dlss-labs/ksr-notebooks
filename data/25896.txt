CLINTON — Officials say the 28-year-old man killed in the Friday night officer shooting in Clinton was armed with two guns and a civilian witness reported seeing an exchange of gunfire among him and two officers.

Myron Flowers was a back-seat passenger in a vehicle stopped late Friday in Clinton for an equipment violation, and though the driver complied with officers, Flowers did not, according to East Feliciana Sheriff’s Chief Criminal Deputy Greg Phares.

“The driver of the car ... was apparently compliant and cooperative, but when the officer attempted to question Mr. Flowers, who was in the rear seat, he noticed a gun in Mr. Flowers’ pocket,” Phares said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “He attempted to secure that gun, and Mr. Flowers struggled with him, and that’s how it started.”
