Mario Jaramillo, a 43-year-old Latino, was shot by police after stabbing himself Saturday, March 27, in the 10800 block of Prairie Avenue in Inglewood, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The confrontation took place about 9:30 p.m., after officers were called to City Farm Market by employees who reported that a man was in the store threatening people with a knife, according to an Inglewood Police Department statement. Upon arrival, officers were informed that the man had been stabbing himself and was hiding on the premises. Following a trail of blood through the store, the officers arrived at a walk-in refrigerator.

The suspect exited the refrigerator holding an ax that he had found inside and made a movement toward an officer, the statement said. Two officers shot the man multiple times, police said.

The officers have been identified as Sgt. John Knapp, a 28-year veteran of the department, and Sgt. Greg Held, a nine-year veteran of the department. Investigations will be conducted by Inglewood police and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.
