Detroit â€” Authorities have identified two people who died Sunday evening in a motorcycle crash following a police chase.

According to police, Gemel Deshawn Brown, 26, of East Lansing was on a 2003 Honda motorcycle with a passenger, Lakreisha Marie Johnson, 15, and pulled out of a private business at a high rate of speed in front of a state police patrol car.

Brown sped down Seven Mile and a state trooper turned around and activated his lights and siren trying to stop the motorcycle, police said. Before the patrol car could catch up with the motorcycle, Brown failed to stop at the intersection of Seven Mile and Huntington Road and struck a 2008 Pontiac passenger vehicle at about 5:18 p.m.

Brown and Johnson were transported to a local hospital and were pronounced dead.

The driver and passenger of the Pontiac sustained minor injuries and were taken to a hospital.
