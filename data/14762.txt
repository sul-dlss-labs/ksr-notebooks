An Ankeny police officer shot and killed a woman after she reportedly pointed a gun at the officer Saturday, according to an Ankeny Police Department news release.

Police went to the 900 block of Southwest Springfield Drive in Ankeny at about 5:15 p.m. Saturday after receiving a report that a suicidal woman was there.

Officers found Marilyn Denise Boyd, 59, with a semi-automatic firearm, the news release said.

Police said that Boyd refused to drop the weapon and pointed the gun at an officer. The officer then shot Boyd, authorities said.

Boyd was taken to Mercy Medical Center, where she later died.

Police declined to identify the officer. The news release said the officer has been with the Ankeny Police Department for five years.

Ankeny police called the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation to investigate the shooting.

The release stated "no further information will be available until the DCI concludes their investigation."
