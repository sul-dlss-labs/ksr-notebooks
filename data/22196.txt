A knife-wielding township man was fatally shot by police early Saturday morning, officials said.

A resident at the building at 83rd Street and Kennedy Boulevard said Daniel Plato-Jacobo, 47, cut himself in the throat with a shard of broken glass prior to police arriving.

At 5:39 a.m., police units responded to a report of a man threatening to harm himself and others at the building, Hudson County Acting Prosecutor Guy Gregory said.

Police officers located Plato-Jacobo inside an apartment holding a knife, Gregory said.

The officers tried unsuccessfully to disarm him using pepper spray and a baton and when he lunged at them, the officers shot him in the chest, Gregory said.

Plato-Jacobo was pronounced dead at 6:42 a.m. at Palisades Medical Center in North Bergen, officials said.

An autopsy showed Plato-Jacobo had additional wounds to his head, neck, and abdomen that may have been self inflicted, Gregory said.

“At this stage of the investigation, it appears the officers’ actions were reasonable,” said Gregory, adding the investigation into the matter is continuing.

Saul Cavero, 60, a resident at the building, told The Jersey Journal he called 911 after he saw Plato-Jacobo smash a bottle of liquor at the entrance of the building and then pick up a piece of the shattered bottle and cut his own throat.

Plato-Jacobo then ran into the building and into the third-floor apartment where he lived, Cavero said.

Neighbors said Plato-Jacobo was a Guatemalan immigrant who worked as a landscaper and lived by himself.

In a separate incident Saturday, another apparently emotionally disturbed man, Salvador Rosario of Paterson, was fatally shot by police in that city. Rosario was shot after he lunged at officers holding a hammer, according to officials.
