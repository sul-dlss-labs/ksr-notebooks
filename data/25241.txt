Law enforcement in Barrow County said a man police were chasing Sunday night shot and killed himself before he could be arrested.

Capt. Ryan Sears with the Barrow County Sheriff's Office said the incident unfolded around 10 p.m. when Winder Police Department officers attempted to stop a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro on South Broad Street because of suspended registration on the vehicle.

"The driver of the Camaro failed to yield to the Winder Officer and Barrow County Sheriffâ€™s Office Deputies took the lead of the pursuit while it was traveling southbound on Loganville Highway," Sears wrote in a press statement.

"The driver of the Camaro encountered stopped traffic at the intersection of Loganville Highway and Highway 316 where he attempted to negotiate a U-turn and ultimately the Camaro became stuck in a muddy construction area."

Sears said when deputies approached the vehicle, they broke out a window to arrest the driver.

"At this time the deputies on scene determined the driver had sustained a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his head prior to the deputies approaching on foot," Sears wrote.

The Barrow County Sheriff's Office has asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to assist with the investigation.

The name of the driver has not yet been released.
