A 17-year-old died and the man driving the stolen car they were riding in was hospitalized after speeding away from a deputy, losing control and then crashing into a signal pole in Colton Saturday night, Nov. 7, authorities said.

The teenager was a Colton resident and the passenger of a Nissan Altima driven by an 18-year-old Loma Linda man, San Bernardino Sheriff’s officials said in a news release. A deputy was following the stolen vehicle they were traveling in when it took off east on Barton Road.

The Nissan traveled less than a mile before going into a shoulder and slamming into a signal pole at the intersection of Barton and Washington Street at about 11:29 p.m., Sheriff’s officials said. Its passenger died at the scene of the wreck, and the driver was taken to a hospital.

Their identities were not immediately released. Further details were not available Sunday afternoon.
