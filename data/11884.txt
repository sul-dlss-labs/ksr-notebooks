HAYWARD (CBS SF) -- A suspected car thief who was fatally shot by a Hayward police officer in a confrontation on Friday was identified Monday as 21-year-old Mohammed Shah of Hayward.

Hayward police Lt. Roger Keener said Shah had a criminal arrest record that includes an arrest for allegedly stealing a vehicle in a prior incident in early September.

Keener said that at 11:12 a.m. on Friday, a patrol officer who was checking license plates in response to a citizen's report of a speeding vehicle spotted a parked car in a residential area near the intersection of Briergate Way and Vanderbilt Street that he confirmed had been stolen.

According to Sgt. Mark Ormsby, the officer ordered Shah, who was the sole occupant of the green Honda Accord, to show his hands several times but Shah refused to comply.

He said Shah then reached for a weapon inside the stolen car so the officer fired at him, thinking that his life was in danger.

The officer, who was on his own initially, then called for assistance and a second officer arrived and helped him detain and treat Shah, Ormsby said.

Shah was taken to Eden Medical Center in Castro Valley where he was later pronounced dead, Ormsby said.

A weapon was found inside the Honda but Shah did not fire it, according to Ormsby.

Hayward police obtained a warrant to search the Honda but Keener declined to disclose the results of the search because the car's owner hasn't yet been contacted so police can clarify which items belonged to the owner and which items might have belonged to Shah.

The vehicle had been stolen from elsewhere in Hayward, Ormsby said.

The shooting occurred near Treewood Elementary School, which was placed on lockdown for about 15 to 20 minutes, he said.
