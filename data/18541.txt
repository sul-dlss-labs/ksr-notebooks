Original Post: At 8:21 a.m., South Hilo Patrol officers responded to a report of an injured woman at an apartment complex on the 100 block of Banyan Drive.

Arriving officers found a 41-year-old woman with severe lacerations. Hawai‘i Fire Department personnel took her to Hilo Medical Center, where she was reported to be in critical condition.

Her condition was later upgraded to serious but stable.

Detectives from the Area I Criminal Investigations Section are investigating the case as an attempted murder.

At about 9:02 a.m. Friday, patrol officers responded to an address on the 1800 block of Kaumana Drive after receiving a call from road surveyors in the area, who reported that a local male drove up in a grey Honda sedan.

The male suspect exited the Honda and entered the workers’ vehicle that was parked near them, and then drove off.

Police determined that the Honda had been stolen from a home on Ocean View Drive in Hilo.

They recovered the car, along with evidence suggesting the two cases are related.

Police are looking for the worker’s vehicle, which is a grey 2010 Nissan Frontier pickup truck, license plate 318 HDS. It has a white camper shell and aluminum racks.

Police are also looking for 30-year-old Stephen Joshua Whitney. He is described as Hawaiian, 5-foot-8, 170 pounds with brown eyes and short black hair. He has tattoos on his neck, left ear, inner forearm and one on his left temple that says “Do or Die.”

Police caution the public not to approach him if they know his whereabouts but, instead, to call the Police Department’s non-emergency line at 935-3311 or contact Detective Kayne Kelii at 961-2378 or [email protected].
