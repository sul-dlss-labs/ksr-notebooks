LAFAYETTE, La. (KPEL) -- The Lafayette Parish Sheriff's Office has decided to settle with the mother of a Lafayette man who died shortly after being tased by a sheriff's deputy in October 2010.

KATC TV-3 reports the mother of 28-year-old Javon Rakestrau and sheriff's office have chosen to settle a federal wrongful death lawsuit.

Authorities said Lafayette Parish Sheriff's deputy Chris Guidry used a stun gun while trying to arrest Rakestrau in connection with a suspected drug sale.

A pathologist's report indicated the ultimate cause of death was complications from bronchial asthma, though the report did state that stress from the altercation with Guidry may have contributed to Rakestrau's death.

The sheriff's office released the dash cam video from Guidry's patrol car, which officials said proved he followed protocol.
