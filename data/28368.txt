Hopewell Road resident John Reading looks at a new utility pole that was installed in front of his home. It replaced a pole that was destroyed early Monday by a driver who reportedly slammed into it while fleeing police. A passenger in the vehicle, 21-year-old Zachary Carter of Clear Brook, was killed in the crash.
