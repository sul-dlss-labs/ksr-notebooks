The man who was shot and killed last week by a U.S. Forest Service officer had sprayed bear repellent in the face of the officer just before the shooting.

According to the Coconino County Sheriffs Office, on Sept. 19, Forest Service officer Douglas Pederson was called out to a report of a man camping of Forest Service Road 616 near the junction of Highway 260 and State Route 87 in far southeastern Coconino County.

When Pederson arrived he found Courtney James VanRiper, 66, from Oklahoma City camping in the area. Pederson asked VanRiper to turn down the volume on a DVD player so he could speak to him.

VanRiper started rummaging around in his vehicle. After several minutes, Pederson asked VanRiper to come out of the vehicle. VanRiper continued to rummage through the vehicle and Pederson asked him several more times to come out of the vehicle.

When VanRiper did leave the vehicle, he sprayed Pederson in the face with a can of bear repellent or pepper spray, according to the report. Unable to see, Pederson drew his gun and fired multiple rounds at VanRiper, striking him twice.

Pederson told emergency dispatchers that shots had been fired and called for an ambulance. He administered first aid to VanRiper until medical personnel from the Pine/Strawberry Fire Department arrived. Officers from the Forest Service, the Arizona Department of Public Safety and FBI also responded to the shooting.

VanRiper was transported to Payson Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. Deputies have been unable to locate next of kin for VanRiper, who was also known as Van Ripper.

According to the Coconino Sheriffâ€™s Office, the vehicle VanRiper was using had been reported stolen from Flagstaff. A stolen handgun was also found in the vehicle. A records check showed that VanRiper also had an outstanding felony warrant for a probation violation issued out of Yavapai County Superior Court.
