A parolee fatally shot following a sheriff’s pursuit in Hemet was identified Friday as a 27-year-old San Jacinto man.

According to sheriff’s spokesman Deputy Michael Vasquez, deputies spotted Vallejo about 4:30 p.m., driving in the area of California Road and state Route 74, on the outskirts of Hemet, and recognized him as a convicted felon wanted for alleged parole violations.

When deputies attempted to stop Vallejo, he punched his accelerator, heading east into the city, Vasquez said.

“After a brief pursuit, the suspect vehicle collided with a fence at the intersection of Cawston and Acacia avenues,” he said. “Immediately after the collision, the suspect emerged from his vehicle and pointed a firearm at deputies, causing an officer-involved shooting.”
