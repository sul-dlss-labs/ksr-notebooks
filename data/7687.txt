In-Custody Death Investigation at 1312 Tabor December 08, 2008 - Houston police are awaiting autopsy results in the apparent suicide of a man at 1312 Tabor about 1:30 p.m. on Saturday (Dec. 6). The victim, identified as Peter Kosta Ioannidas, 50, of Houston, suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant R. Torres and Officer S. J. Anderson reported: Patrol officers responded to a burglary of a residence in progress call at 1312 Tabor and determined the incident was an argument between Mr. Ioannidas and his landlord over rent payments. Escorted by the landlord, officers entered the residence and confronted Ioannidas inside of his bedroom. Since the bedroom had no light, officers asked him to step outside to discuss the matter. Wearing only boxer shorts, Ioannidis asked officers if he could put on some pants before coming out. Officers then walked out to the living room to wait and about 30 seconds later, heard a muffled gunshot. Officers quickly exited the residence, took cover, and called for back-up and a supervisor. The HPD Special Weapons And Tactics team responded, checked the residence with a remote controlled camera and found Ioannidas apparently deceased. SWAT officers then made entry into the residence and determined Ioannidas had a gunshot wound to the forehead. According to witnesses, Ioannidas had a prior medical condition and this was his fourth known suicide attempt. The investigation is continuing. VHS/JC
