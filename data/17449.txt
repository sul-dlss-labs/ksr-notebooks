A man at the center of a child molestation investigation fatally shot himself as detectives made their way into his martial arts studio to serve a search warrant Wednesday, police said.

Sean Curtis, 38, armed himself with a pistol when detectives entered his business at 1746 S. Victoria Ave., according to the Ventura Police Department. As police rushed to get back out, they said they heard a gunshot.

Curtis was later found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, police claim.

Police say Curtis owned and operated a Kenpo-based martial arts school - a franchisee of a larger, national chain called United Studios of Self Defense.

Police said there are two alleged victims in the case - both 10-year-old girls - with one claiming an incident happened a week ago. Detectives urged parents of children enrolled in classes at the dojo to speak with police.

Anyone with information was asked to call the Ventura Police Department.
