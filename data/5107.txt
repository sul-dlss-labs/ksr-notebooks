LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) - A 30-year-old man died from unknown health problems after a brief struggle with Lafayette police officers during an undercover narcotics operation.

Officer Jennifer Taylor, spokeswoman for the department, says Dameon Keith Harmon died after he allegedly ingested what police believe to be cocaine while being pursued by officers through a known drug area.

Taylor says Harmon and officers struggled briefly Wednesday while they attempted to apprehend him but she did not believe officers used excessive force during the arrest.

Investigators are awaiting an autopsy from the Lafayette Coroner's Office to determine exactly how Harmon died.
