PHOENIX — A suspect was shot and killed by an officer in southern Arizona over the weekend after he allegedly moved toward police while armed with knives.

Jason Demarcus Larkin, 35, was pronounced dead at a Yuma medical center after the Saturday afternoon shooting, Yuma County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Alfonso Zavala said in an email.

Officers were called to the scene in Gadsden, a border town about 15 miles southwest of Yuma, around 1 p.m. in response to calls that Larkin was armed with two knives and blocking traffic.

The San Luis Police Department officers gave multiple commands to Larkin to drop the knives, but he did not comply.

Police then used a TASER in an attempt to subdue Larkin, but he continued to move toward the officers.

Zavala said one San Luis officer fired at Larkin, but did not say how many shots were fired.

No further information was provided.

The Yuma County Sheriff’s Office Criminal Investigations Bureau is investigating.

Anyone with information regarding this case is asked to contact the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office at 928-783-4427 or 78-CRIME.
