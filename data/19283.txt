According to investigators, the shooting was a result of an illegal drug transaction that didn't go as planned at the Waffle House on Sumter Highway back on Nov. 8.

Investigators say a man ran across the parking lot and shot into an SUV. The SUV drove away and the gunman got into another vehicle that fled the scene. The SUV then arrived at the KershawHealth Emergency Room where Mendoza later died due to injuries.

McMillan, who is considered armed and dangerous, was last seen driving a dark-colored 2013 Kia Optima with a South Carolina license plate tag listed as LIK 223.
