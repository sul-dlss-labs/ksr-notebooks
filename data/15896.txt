A 29-year-old man suspected in the fatal shooting of a woman died Wednesday morning after he was shot by deputies in a South Los Angeles alley.

Officers confronted the man, armed with a shotgun, at an alley near 102nd Street and Vermont Avenue at around 1:30 a.m, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman said. He opened fire on the lawmen and they returned fire, authorities said.

"He shot at the deputies, and a deputy-involved shooting occurred as a result of that," said Capt. Rod Kusch.

Deputies had earlier been at the 1000 block of 106th Street, where they found a female victim who had been shot dead. The report of the initial shooting came in at 1:14 a.m, police said.

The victim was identified only as a woman in her 20s or 30s. Witnesses reported the sound of gunfire after what sounded like an argument.

"I woke up to the shots," said resident Elehondro Powell. "I heard the police cars coming, and pretty much at the same time you hear the shots."

Deputies then found the gunman in the alley. He was ordered to drop the weapon several times, according to the sheriff's department.

Authorities have not confirmed the relationship between the gunman and victim.
