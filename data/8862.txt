A relative told investigators that Mr. Singh had a history of emotional problems, the police said. Several people who live near Ms. Balbir said in interviews that her son appeared to have emotional trouble.

Four officers, including a sergeant, arrived at an apartment on the second floor of 3055 Third Avenue, near 156th Street in the Melrose section, around 11 p.m. Sunday after the authorities received a call from another of Ms. Balbir’s sons, who said that he had not heard from his mother.

The officers heard noises from inside the apartment but nobody answered. The building’s superintendent opened the door, but it was chained shut from the inside. Through the door’s opening, the officers saw Mr. Singh standing over his mother, who was covered in blood and sitting on a couch, the police said, adding that he was repeatedly hitting her with a pan.

The officers broke the door down, entered the apartment and told Mr. Singh repeatedly to drop the pan, the police said.

Mr. Singh did not do so, and as he raised the pan to strike his mother again, one of the officers fired two shots at him, the police said. He staggered away from his mother but then moved back toward her and raised the pan again to strike her. The sergeant fired once, and the officer who fired the first shots fired two more times, the police said.
