MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- A grand jury cleared a Minnesota State Trooper from any charges after he shot and killed a woman back in September 2011.

Trooper David Kalinoff shot 48-year-old Debra Doree of Landfall, Minn. on Interstate 94 near Oakdale, Minn.

It started as a routine traffic stop, until Doree jumped back into her car and hit the gas.

Kalinoff reached into the car to try and remove the keys, but wasn't fast enough.

He was dragged 200 feet before he opened fire. Doree died.

The grand jury ruled Kalinoff was forced to shoot to save himself from death or great bodily harm.

Kalinoff, a 12-year veteran of the Minnesota State Patrol, was put on paid administrative leave during the time, which is standard procedure.
