Footage filmed by a bystander shows Eric Garner being wrestled to the ground in a chokehold by an NYPD officer before turning limp. The father, 43, can be heard gasping 'I can't breathe'. He was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Protests have erupted in New York after a grand jury failed to indict the officer responsible
