PUNTA GORDA, Fla. â€“ The Charlotte County Sheriff's Office held a press conference Wednesday with further details about a deadly officer-involved shooting earlier this week.

The incident happened on Marcum Street in Englewood Sunday night, and ended with Jacob Taulbee dead.

According to Sheriff Bill Prummell, a woman called 911 hysterically in fear of Taulbee, saying he would kill the cops. The caller locked herself in a bathroom, and Taulbee was able to put knife holes in the door and gain entry.

The 911 caller was able to talk Taulbee into going outside.

Three deputies arrived and heard a rustling in the woods next to the house, then saw Taulbee come out in a threatening manner with two knives, a 14-inch knife and a 5-inch knife.

The deputies ordered Taulbee to stop with firearms drawn. Taulbee came within 10 feet of deputies before Deputy Scott Sarver, a 23-year veteran of the force, opened fire, striking Taulbee all 8 times.

"You meet deadly force with deadly force, and that's how we're trained," said Sheriff Prummell. "There's been a lot of chatter about why we did not use less lethal. Well, you meet lethal force with lethal force. If you take out a taser, there's a chance you can hit them with a taser, but if the prongs miss or you're off target, it takes time to reload that taser."

An autopsy revealed that Taulbee was highly intoxicated at the time.

A 13-year-old girl was also in the house at the time, locked in her bedroom.

Deputy Sarver, as well as deputies Tony Soltis and Adam Freitas, have been placed on administrative leave during the investigation, as is customary in cases where shots are fired by deputies.
