A 77-year-old man shot by a Birmingham police officer conducting a welfare check has died, according to the Jefferson County Coroner's Office.

Douglas Harris died Friday, according to the coroner's office.

Harris was shot by a Birmingham police officer Feb. 20 when the officer and firefighters went to his apartment at the East Lake House in the 7900 block of First Avenue South.

Police said in February that when the officer went to the door on the fourth floor and knocked, Harris pointed a gun at the officer. The officer then fired shots and hit him.

Harris was taken to UAB Hospital and was in stable condition that night.

The shooting is being investigated by the State Bureau of Investigation, as is standard procedure with officer-involved shootings.
