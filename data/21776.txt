ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – The Albuquerque Police Department has released video of the deadly police shooting that happened Monday.

Things escalated quickly two nights ago after an officer tried pull over a man driving a moped. Police said he was driving the moped that didn’t have plates.

“This one is cut and dry,” Officer Tanner Tixier said. “Mr. Savelli produces a firearm, police officer shoots Mr. Savelli.”

Wednesday, police released lapel video from that officer’s camera. You can see he’s headed west down Phoenix Avenue, trying to pull 43-year-old Robert Savelli over. He passed the officer and refused to stop.

“He actually used his vehicle to block the path of the scooter,” Ofc. Tixier said.

Then, the officer got out of his SUV and ran around it. Savelli took off on foot, but at one point turned toward the officer while running.

“Witness reports state that Mr Savelli was armed with a firearm and pointed it at the officer,” Ofc. Tixier said.

The officer then pulled his gun and fired several rounds, hitting Savelli.

When the officers got close to him, what appeared to be a gun was just below Savelli’s right hand.

Police said Savelli was wanted on three separate felony warrants at the time. The officer is a nine-year veteran of the department.
