A Sheboygan police officer was justified in shooting a man who he had pulled over after a Sept. 3 traffic stop because the man was carrying a handgun and had threatened the officer's life, the Sheboygan County district attorney said in an opinion released Tuesday.

Officer Brandon Munnik, a seven-year veteran of Sheboygan's police department, shot and killed James L. Knee, 52, of Two Rivers after Knee's Pontiac led Munnik and his squad car on a chase through residential areas of Sheboygan.

After Knee's car was stopped, he left his car and walked toward Munnik while holding a silver handgun behind his back, according to Munnik and witnesses in a nearby apartment. Munnik told Knee to stop and used a Taser to try to stop Knee, but the man did not drop his gun.

"The evidence clearly establishes that Officer Munnik's use of deadly force was justifiable," according to a release from District Attorney Joe DeCecco. "Officer Munnik's professionalism and adherence to department policy were the result not only of his training and experience but also reflect his character and dedication to a profession that few citizens fully understand."
