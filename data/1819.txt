A standoff with police in Welsh ended with an exchange of gunfire and the fatal shooting of a man who briefly held a woman and her children hostage. Neighbors identified the man as 55-year-old Lewis Gray.

The shooting occurred last night after police responded to a domestic disturbance call. Police say when they arrived the man had a gun on the woman and her children.

A state police SWAT team and hostage negotiator were called in to diffuse the situation. The man, however, would not answer the telephone in the house.

Authorities surrounded the home, blocking off the street leading to it. Three minutes after authorities cut electrical power to the house, the man came out. There is conflicting information about what happened next. A neighbor says the man did not fire any shots. Police say the man fired his handgun and that officers returned fire, hitting the man.

Authorities say the man died shortly after 3:00 Monday morning at Lafayette General Hospital.

The hostages escaped unharmed.
