A deputy-involved shooting left a Rancho Santa Margarita man dead Tuesday afternoon after Orange County sheriff’s deputies encountered him inside a home.

The shooting occurred just after 2 p.m. at a townhome in the 00 block of Paseo Viento. The deputies received a call from the home saying that Alec Ouzounian was attempting to kill himself, Lt. Jeff Hallock said.

Deputies responded and found the 40-year-old man with several self-inflicted stab wounds, the Sheriff’s Department said.

After a confrontation, Ouzounian was shot, and later died after being taken to a hospital, Hallock said. Information wasn’t immediately available on who called the Sheriff’s Department and what led to the shooting.

“At some point a deputy-involved shooting ensued,” Hallock said.

Resident Giselle Shirley, who lives across the street, said she arrived home around 2:30 p.m., when she saw five or six sheriff’s patrol cars. She heard what sounded like deputies trying to barge through the front door of the home, and then a gunshot.

No deputies were injured. The Orange County District Attorney’s office has taken over the investigation.

The last shooting involving a sheriff’s deputy in south Orange County occurred last June in Ladera Ranch during a response to a domestic violence call. A district attorney report released in February cleared the deputy of any wrongdoing.
