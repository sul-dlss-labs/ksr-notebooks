Sacramento police officers shot and killed a 20-year-old gunman during a standoff early Sunday morning, a spokesman for the police department said.



Just after midnight, police received a call from a private security firm that a man with a gun was walking around the apartment complex at 6730 4th Avenue. When officers arrived, they confronted the man who was pointing the barrel of the gun toward his head and pacing in front of the building. When he saw the officers, he went into an apartment, apparently at random, and fired his gun, according to police department spokesman Terrell Marshall. The people inside the apartment fled, unhurt.



"We were hanging out, a guy barged in and told us to get out. Nobody really moved, no one knew what to do because we didn't know if it was a real gun and then he fired off," said Tyler Rossi who was in the apartment.



Officers called for the department's SWAT team, which contained the man in the complex's parking lot. For about half an hour, officers tried to convince the man to drop his gun, but he did not respond, Marshall said.



The man then pointed his gun at police and bystanders, and officers, fearing he was about to fire on the crowd, shot him, according to Marshall. The man died at the scene. Police have identified him as 20-year-old Apieta Suapia, a student at Sacramento City College.



Police continue to investigate the motive for the man's behavior. The officers involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave and the circumstances of the shooting will be investigated, as is routine in police-involved shootings.
