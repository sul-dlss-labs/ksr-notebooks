A man in New Jersey who was allegedly walking on roofs and attempting to break into homes Saturday died soon after being briefly handcuffed by police, according to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office.

The man’s name was withheld and only limited information was provided in a press release Sunday from the attorney general’s office, which investigates any death that occurs during an encounter with police or while in custody.

The Paterson Police Department received multiple 911 calls at approximately 5:26 p.m. Saturday, in which the callers reported a man walking on roofs on Madison Avenue and attempting to break into homes.

When officers and medical personnel responded, they “encountered a man who appeared injured at the exterior rear of the residence,” the attorney general’s office said.

“Two officers of the Paterson Police Department attempted to aid the injured man. The man was agitated and officers briefly handcuffed him to permit them to secure him and get him onto a stretcher,” the attorney general’s office said.

The man was placed on a stretcher and taken to St. Joseph’s University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 6:22 p.m.

“The investigation is ongoing and no further information is being released at this time,” the attorney general’s office said.
