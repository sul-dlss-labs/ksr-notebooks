COLDWATER, MI (WTVB AM/FM) â€“ A police standoff ended sadly overnight when a 43-year-old Coldwater man died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after firing at Coldwater police officers from a house on Park Place.

Police responded around 9:40 p.m. on Wednesday evening after receiving a call from the home.

The Coldwater Department of Public Safety stated in a news release that officers responded to a reported domestic situation involving a violation of bond.

A condition of the bond stipulated no unwanted contact between the suspect and the female resident and was issued after the man was arrested for misdemeanor assault in January.

When police arrived, the suspect barricaded himself in a bedroom. A noise was heard by officers that sounded like he was loading a firearm.

A woman and her children were hurried out of the house to safety by police.

Coldwater Police Sgt. Korin Bordner reports a series of gunshots rang out from inside the house with bullets whizzing past them. She says officers did not return fire.

A Quincy Police officer and several Michigan State Police troopers arrived and formed a perimeter around the house. The State Police Emergency Services Team was called in to help safely resolve the situation.

As they were gathering, officers heard what sounded like two more gun shots from within the house.

The Emergency Services Team surrounded the house and tried to contact the suspect but they got no answer. They then used a remote camera and found the man in the bedroom dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. His name has not been released pending the notification of relatives. The case remains under investigation.
