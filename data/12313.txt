SECTION, Alabama - A Section man who kept police in a standoff for more than five hours overnight was shot and killed by officers this morning after he fired on deputies, said Jackson County Sheriff Chuck Phillips.

Jeremy Gregory, 31, of 1723 Jackson County Road 48, went to his home and barricaded himself inside at about 11 p.m. Monday after someone reported he was driving erratically and Section Police tried to stop him, Phillips said.

Section Police called Marshall County deputies for backup and officers tried to talk Gregory out of the home. Gregory had a rifle and fired shots at the officers, Phillips said.

After trying to talk Gregory from the house for about four hours, the sheriff called Madison County's SWAT team for assistance.

Just before daylight today, the SWAT threw tear gas inside the home, the sheriff said.

"That's when Gregory began firing at the deputies and deputies returned fire and Gregory was killed," Phillips said.

The Alabama Bureau of Investigation was called and is now in charge of the case.

Phillips said he did not know why Gregory barricaded himself or why he was driving recklessly.

"The body will be sent for an autopsy," he said.
