A Tulsa man was killed after he was thrown from his pickup truck during a crash while leading police on a overnight high-speed chase, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.

Kevin Hilburn, 34, was traveling eastbound on Interstate 44 just east of 33rd West Avenue about 11:50 p.m. Thursday and being pursued by Sapulpa police, OHP said.

Hilburn, who was driving a 2000 Chevrolet pickup, failed to negotiate a curve at the 33rd West Avenue exit and overturned multiple times before he was ejected, troopers said.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, troopers said.

Michiko Henderson, 19, a passenger in the truck, was taken to St. John Medical Center for treatment and later released.

No other injuries were reported at the scene, troopers said.
