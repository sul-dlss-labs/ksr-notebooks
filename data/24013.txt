A fatal crash between a Lee County Sheriff's Office cruiser and a Fort Myers bicyclist at U.S. 41 and Estero Parkway in south Lee County Saturday night is being investigated by the Florida Highway Patrol.

An FHP report said the 2009 Ford Crown Victoria cruiser, driven by LCSO employee Tyler Davot, 29, was southbound on 41 in the center lane approaching a green light for Estero Parkway around 9:30 p.m.

It was not clear if Davot is a deputy or another rank.

The bicyclist, Steven Mammarella, 29, was crossing U.S. 41 on the north side of the intersection traveling east.

Mammarella traveled into the center lane and into the cruiserâ€™s path, the FHP said, with the right front of the cruiser hitting the left side of Mammarella's Ozone model bicycle.

The FHP report also said witnesses told investigators that they saw a white van traveling southbound after the initial crash with sparks coming from the bottom of the van. It was unknown, the FHP said, if the van struck the cyclist or debris.

Mammarella, who was not wearing a helmet the FHP said, was transported to Gulf Coast Medical Center by Lee County EMS and later pronounced dead.

The FHP said that at the time of the crash, the cruiser was not traveling to a call and did not have any emergency equipment activated.

If anyone has information about the white van they are asked to call the Florida Highway Patrol at 239-938-1800.
