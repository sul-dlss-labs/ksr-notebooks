Officers were summoned to The Medical Center of Southeast Texas in reference to assisting family members and medical staff with an uncooperative mental patient who was identified as Manuel Delacruz. Upon arrival officers found Delacruz roaming outside of the hospital.

Delacruz was detained and returned to his room without incident. Once inside of his room and while officers were completing the emergency mental detention forms to lawfully detain Delacruz for a mental evaluation Delacruz became violent, combative and punched one the officers in the nose. While officers were attempting to gain control of Delacruz, he was able to gain control of one officers pepper spray.

The pepper spray was able to be taken away from Delacruz. Delacruz then attempted to take one of the officer's duty pistol but was unsuccessful. During the struggle before Delacruz was secured a Taser drive stun was applied for pain compliance. After a brief struggle, Delacruz was placed into handcuffs and secured for his safety.

After Delacruz was secured, it was immediately apparent that he was unresponsive. His handcuffs were immediately removed and medical staff stepped in to begin treating Delacruz for his unresponsiveness. The medical staff was unsuccessful in reviving Delacruz and he was pronounced deceased after all medical efforts failed.
