SPARTA — A 65-year-old man shot himself Monday afternoon during a standoff with authorities in Sparta, according to police.

The man, whose name was not released, refused to cooperate with an officer trying to serve him with a warrant about 1:45 p.m. at 100 Avon St., Lot 113.

He displayed a gun, and the officer left the home before the man continued to threaten police with additional firearms, police stated.

Neighboring residences were evacuated, and the man refused to cooperate with negotiators on the Monroe County Tactical Team. La Crosse County’s BearCat and robot responded to the scene, and pepper spray was used inside the residence.

Tactical teams members found the man dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after entering the home.
