A homeless man, from Clinton, allegedly fired a gun at another person, and pointed a handgun at a deputy, before he eventually took his own life, according to police.

Casey Van Armstrong, 32, had reportedly fired a gun at another person and was then chasing another vehicle, in rural Andover, when police got a 911 call about the incident just after 1 p.m. Sunday, December 20, 2015.

When a deputy arrived there, Armstrong allegedly pointed a handgun at the deputy who then pursued Armstrong’s white Dodge pickup truck. The pursuit went through northeastern Clinton County and ended in the 400 block of East 11th Street in DeWitt, near the high school. The street was blocked off and police surrounded Armstrong’s vehicle.

Armstrong allegedly fired a shot and waved a handgun as he remained in his truck for nearly two hours, investigators said. At around 3:30 p.m., police said they heard a gunshot from inside the truck and then found Armstrong suffering a gunshot wound to his chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
