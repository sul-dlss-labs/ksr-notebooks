A man was killed Saturday after he jumped out of a moving vehicle during a police chase in Red Bluff, police said.

Officers tried to stop a vehicle at about 6:45 p.m. in the 1000 block of Walnut Street for a traffic violation, however, the driver failed to pull over, police said.

When police pursued the vehicle down Paskenta Road a passenger jumped out of the vehicle and was run over by the vehicle he jumped out of, police said. The man was killed during the incident, police said.

The man's name is not being released until his family has been notified of his death, police said.

However, the vehicle chase continued to the 300 block of Paskenta Road when the driver, Brian Son, 40, of Red Bluff stopped, got out of the vehicle and ran into a nearby garage where he had been living, police said.

Red Bluff police officers and Tehama County sheriff's deputies chased him and arrested him in the garage, police said.

Officers found several stolen firearms in the garage, police said. Also in the garage were Jeremy Swain, 38, of Red Bluff and Pedro Avila, 42, of Gerber. They were arrested on suspicion of obstructing officers, police said.

Son was arrested on suspicion of hit and run resulting in death, evading police while causing serious bodily injury or death, being a felon with a firearm and resisting arrest.

Policle said Son was scheduled to be released from prison in December, but he was released July 14 due to COVID-19. After he was let out of prison he did not report to probation, police said.
