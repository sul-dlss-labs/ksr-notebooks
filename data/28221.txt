A man described by the Orange County Sheriff's Office as a wanted suspect, 39-year-old Lewis Ruffin Jr., was shot and killed by deputies on Tuesday. A tip about the wanted man's whereabouts brought deputies to Pendleton Drive around 11 a.m. Tuesday.Sheriff John Mina says the call came from Ruffin's girlfriend. "Obviously, she was frightened. He made statements that he was not going back to prison," Mina said. A newly-released arrest warrant shows last Thursday, Ruffin was arrested in Polk County for allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a kitchen knife and trying to run her off the road as she tried driving away.He bonded out of jail and the girlfriend told police she was walking her dog in her neighborhood Sunday, when Ruffin forced her into a car while holding a gun.On Monday, a report says he texted her saying he was going back to the apartment so that police could kill him.Five deputies arrived to find Ruffin holding a gun, according to Mina, and he allegedly shot at them twice. Mina said the deputies, possibly all five, shot back several times. It's not known how many shots were fired, but neighbors reported hearing several. "I told my family to stay away from the window," one man told WESH 2. "As soon as it was over, about a minute, I went outside to find a man on the ground with police all over him, guns drawn."Several neighbors said they did not recognize the man who was shot and killed. No deputies were hurt during the shooting.
