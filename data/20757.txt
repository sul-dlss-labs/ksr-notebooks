KOUTS â€” A Winamac man died late Sunday night following a collision with a Kouts police car on Ind. 8 and Baums Bridge Road.

Porter County sheriff's officers responded to the crash involving a green 1998 Buick Regal and a Kouts police vehicle at 9:17 p.m. Sunday.

Based on witness statements and initial investigation, Kouts police Officer Brock Moore, 24, was eastbound on Ind. 8 approaching the area of Baums Bridge Road, according to Porter County sheriff's spokesperson Sgt. Jamie Erow.

The Buick, driven by Robert Lindsey, 45, of Winamac, was northbound on Baums Bridge Road. Police said initial investigation indicates Lindsey failed to yield the right of way to the 2008 Chevrolet Impala police car and entered the intersection. The Buick was struck on the driver's side by the police car, Erow said.

Kouts Town Marshal James Smith said Moore was on duty Sunday night when the accident occurred. However, Smith said he has turned the investigation over to the Sheriff's Office and does not have any additional details.

Also in the Buick was a 4-year-old girl who was ejected. She was airlifted to Parkview Hospital in Fort Wayne with serious injuries.

Lindsey was transported to Porter Regional Hospital, where he was pronounced dead by the Porter County coroner's office at 11:36 p.m., according to Porter County Coroner Chuck Harris. Routine toxicology will be performed to determine whether drugs or alcohol were factors in the accident, Harris said.

Moore was transported to Porter Regional Hospital with head lacerations and later released. He has been on the department since February.

The sheriff's accident reconstruction team is continuing to investigate the accident, Erow said.

Assisting at the scene were Hebron Police Department, Kouts Fire Department, Porter EMS, Samaritan Medical Transport from Fort Wayne and H&A Towing.
