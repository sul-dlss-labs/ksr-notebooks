â€” Authorities said Friday morning that a burglary suspect had been shot by a Little Rock police dectective.

Sgt. Cassandra Davis said officers responded to burglary in progress about 9:40 a.m. at 4521 W. 16th St. and noticed one man loading items from the duplex into a gray Toyota Camry, driven by a second person. Both suspects fled the scene in the vehicle, and officers pursued them.

The suspects stopped in an alley near South Brown Street, where the chase continued on foot. One suspect appeared to surrender before he purportedly charged one of the officers, Davis said. The officers, who Davis declined to identify, said a struggle ensued. The second officer shot the suspect after it appeared he was attempting to take hold of the first officer's firearm.

The second individual was later arrested without incident.

The deceased suspect was identified as Michael W. Daniel, 25, of 1504 S. Pine St. The second suspect, identified as Marcus Davis, 26, of 4115 S. Malloy St. has been charged with capital murder, theft, fleeing and burglary.

Davis said the officers involved in the shooting have been placed on paid leave. One of the officers received minor injuries in the incident.
