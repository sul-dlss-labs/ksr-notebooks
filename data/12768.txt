EUREKA • A man fatally shot here by police after a pursuit Friday was identified by authorities Saturday as Jose H. Garcia, 49, of Des Plaines, Ill., near Chicago.

Police said Garcia had fled from Illinois State Police after multiple traffic violations earlier Friday and fled again when a Missouri Highway Patrol trooper spotted him southeast of St. Clair on Interstate 44.

Authorities used tire spikes to try to stop his car, near Augustine and Williams roads in Eureka. Officers fired multiple shots after Garcia accelerated his car and pointed a gun at them, the highway patrol said.

He died at Mercy Hospital St. Louis, in Creve Coeur.

Officers from the highway patrol, St. Louis County police, Eureka police and Franklin County sheriff’s department participated in the pursuit. The shooting is being investigated by the highway patrol.

Five nearby schools, Blevins Elementary, Geggie Elementary, Eureka Elementary, LaSalle Springs Middle School and Eureka High School, went on "modified lockdown" at 1:15 p.m. Friday for about 15 minutes because of proximity to the chase.
