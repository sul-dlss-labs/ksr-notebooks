GILLETTE, Wyo. (AP) – A police officer who shot a man to death last Monday will not face criminal charges, the Campbell County prosecutor said.

Officer Brent Wasson was defending himself and his partner, Sgt. Steve Hamilton, when he shot Randy Lee Linder, 42, Campbell County Attorney Mike Fuller said.

Linder died at Campbell County Memorial Hospital of a gunshot wound to his chest. He was shot after a struggle in which he drew a gun on Hamilton, Fuller said.

There was an imminent and immediate threat of death or serious bodily harm to the two officers, Fuller said.

Wasson works for the Gillette Police Department and Hamilton works for the Campbell County Sheriffs Office. Both are agents for the Northeast Wyoming Drug Enforcement Task Force.

The officers planned to serve Linder with a warrant for domestic violence at his estranged wifes house. As they waited for him outside, Linder, who was known to carry a handgun, pulled up in a pickup, Fuller said.

Hamilton approached him with an arrest warrant. Linder put his hands under the coat he was wearing and ignored Hamiltons orders to show his hands, Fuller said.

As Hamilton approached Linder, Hamilton kicked Linder, attempting to take him to the ground, but Linder regained his balance, turned and ran, Fuller said.

Both officers chased him with guns drawn and tackled him. Hamilton pinned Linders left hand to the ground while Wasson reached for Linders right hand. As Wasson reached for Linders hand, he felt the back strap of a handgun Linder was holding, Fuller said.

Wasson felt Linder raise the barrel of the gun up toward Hamilton, Fuller said. Wasson fired his own handgun once, striking Linder in the lower chest.

Linder was holding a Glock 9mm pistol with a round in the chamber and a full magazine of ammunition, Fuller said.

Wasson has been on paid administrative leave, said Police Chief Ric Paul. Wasson met with a counselor who specializes in police stress and plans to return to work in about a week.

The department will conduct an internal review of the shooting, Paul said.

I dont have any reason at this point to believe that the officer acted outside of the scope of our policy, Paul said. Obviously, its been determined he was within the scope of state statute.
