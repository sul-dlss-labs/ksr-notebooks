MIAMI, OK — The Oklahoma Highway Patrol has identified an Ottawa County man who was killed Friday after he reportedly brandished a handgun at a trooper.

Gary Timmie Collins, 63, of Miami, was stopped during a traffic check in a Miami neighborhood, said Lt. John Vincent, a patrol spokesman.

While stopped at the checkpoint a trooper waved Collins over, Vincent said. Instead of stopping, Collins started to flee, leading troopers on a 6-block pursuit, Vincent said.

When Collins stepped out of his vehicle he showed a weapon in a manner said to be threatening and was fatally shot by a trooper, Vincent said.

The trooper’s name was not released but he has been put on administrative leave, Vincent said.

According to court records, Collins was ticketed in 2001 for transporting an open container and in 2005 for failure to wear a seat belt.
