PHOENIX â€” A trespassing suspect has died following an officer-involved shooting in central Phoenix on Tuesday, authorities said.

No officers were injured in the incident.

The suspect was identified Wednesday as 34-year-old Alexandre J. Aldrich.

Phoenix police initially responded to a trespassing call at the Extended Stay America on Osborn Road near Third Avenue.

A police spokesman said there were two confrontations with the suspect, one at the hotel and a second about a block and a half to the east.

Officers first tried to subdue the suspect using Tasers.

The suspect was shot after advancing toward officers while holding an object that was perceived as a threat. Police later said the object was an open-ended handcuff.

Osborn Road was closed in both directions between Central and Third avenues for most of the day while the investigation was ongoing.

The Phoenix Police Department has been involved in more shootings this year than in all of 2017.

After officers fatally shot a man who was brandishing a handgun on a bus near Metrocenter Mall in May, the department said there had been 23 officer-involved shootings in 2018. In 2017, there were 21 such events.
