Moultrie -- The investigation continues into a fatal shooting involving a Moultrie Police Officer.

Sgt. Bruce Hamm remains on leave for shooting a man with a knife who charged at a fellow officer.

This is the second time Sgt. Hamm has fired fatal shots in the line of duty. In 1997, Sgt. Hamm was involved in a shootout with a man at a Subway Restaurant. The man shooting at officer Hamm was killed.

Last Thursday, when Sgt. Bruce Hamm shot Willie Banks, it was because police say Banks pulled a pocket knife as they were serving a bench warrant.'

People close to his family say Banks was handing over a knife he used as a box cutter for work.

Police tell a different story. They say Banks was charging at one of the arresting officers.

Sgt. Bruce Hamm joined the Moultrie Police Department 12 years ago.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is looking into last week's shooting death.
