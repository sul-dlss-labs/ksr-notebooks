Roanoke police have identified the 67-year-old man who fatally shot himself Wednesday after engaging in a three-hour standoff with police outside his northwest Roanoke home.

Spokesman Scott Leamon said officers were sent to Carl Anderson Clingempeel’s home in the 1800 block of Angus Road at about 1:20 p.m.

The call was initiated by a friend who reported that Clingempeel was suicidal. Leamon said Clingempeel fired one shot about the same time that police arrived, but no injuries were reported.

Clingempeel remained in the woods behind his home throughout the standoff. Police brought an armored vehicle and tactical response team to the scene. About 30 minutes later, they entered Clingempeel’s back yard, and a single shot was fired.

Leamon said the man shot himself about 4:35 p.m. No officers fired their weapons during the incident.

Clingempeel was taken to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 5:24 p.m.
