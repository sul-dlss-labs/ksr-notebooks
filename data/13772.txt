Lorenzo Cesar Aguilar, a 23-year-old Latino man, was shot by an Asuza police officer Friday, Nov. 29, 2013, in the 700 block of East Alosta Avenue in Azusa, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 9:30 p.m., Azusa Police Department officers tried to pull over a person suspected of drunk driving, according to a news release from the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department, which is assisting in the investigation.

The driver, later identified as Aguilar, didn’t stop the car, and “evaded officers for a brief time.” Officers were able to find the car again and the driver stopped.

Right after Aguilar pulled over, he exited the car, allegedly armed with a handgun and began to walk away from the officers. Aguilar allegedly “failed to comply with orders,” and turned toward the officers with the gun in hand, “at which time, the officer-involved shooting occurred.”

Aguilar was struck several times in the torso area and was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:45 p.m. A handgun was recovered at the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
