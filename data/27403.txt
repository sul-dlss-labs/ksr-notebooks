ST. PETERSBURG — The two men killed in an Interstate 275 crash early Tuesday morning are brothers, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Andreis Lamont Hayward, 28, of Safety Harbor, and Lorenzo Alexander Hayward, 33, of Clearwater, were identified as the men killed in the crash, troopers said, which took place at about 1:30 a.m. on northbound I-275 approaching the 38th Avenue N pedestrian bridge.

The Highway Patrol publicly released the men’s names on Wednesday.

Troopers said that prior to the crash, St. Petersburg police officers pulled over the 2012 Hyundai Genesis that the men were in, but that the driver took off.

St. Petersburg police said officers had reported seeing the vehicle driving the wrong way on Fifth Avenue S. Officers pulled the car over near Fourth Street S, police said, by the entrance ramp onto I-175.

The car stopped, troopers said, but suddenly took off again and sped away on the interstate. St. Petersburg police did not pursue the car, the Highway Patrol said, but the Hyundai was traveling at a high rate of speed.

Troopers said the driver lost control of the car while trying to negotiate a curve on northbound I-275. The car entered the median, collided with a tree, overturned multiple times and caught fire.

Troopers said Andreis Hayward was the driver. He died at the scene. Lorenzo Hayward was ejected from the vehicle and also died at the scene, troopers said.

Neither man was wearing a seatbelt, troopers said.
