In a confrontation between the unit and gunmen on Tuesday night, one man was killed, a second was arrested and a police officer, Patrick Gonnella, was facing surgery on Thursday, after his protective vest saved his life.

On July 10, another police officer, Richard Borges, also with the task force, was shot while serving an arrest warrant. He is recovering from gunshot wounds to the back and chest.

The task force got its nickname because the officers are dispatched into high crime areas and arrive in a caravan, or train, of five to six police cars. The police said they concentrate on areas that citizens complain about or have a history of crime.

''Crime has gone down, murder has gone down, attacks on police officers have increased,'' said Mayor Sharpe James, defending the unit. ''As police become more visible to bring about a decrease in crime, to bring about a decrease in murder, they themselves are becoming exposed more to lawless individuals who have, what? Who have weapons.''

But many residents see it differently.

''I've been assaulted by members of the train, and nothing was done about it; friends of mine have been assaulted by members of the train, and nothing was done about it,'' said Marcus Allen, the Democratic leader of the 19th District, who lives down the street from where the shooting took place on Tuesday night.
