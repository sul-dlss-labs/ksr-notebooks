A high-speed pursuit spanning two counties ended in a fatal crash Saturday.

Cabarrus County Deputies say that at approximately 5 p.m. they tied to pull over the driver of a 1996 Jaguar XJ-6 on I-485.

Police say the driver, Jashavius Everick Williams, got out of his car but then got back in his vehicle and sped off.

The 22-year-old then led Cabarrus County deputies on a chase traveling at a speed of 90 mph.

The chase went from I-485 to Robinson Church Rd in Charlotte. During the pursuit Williams lost control of his vehicle and ran off the road by Alanbrook Rd.

The car then hit and wrapped around a tree. Williams was pronounced dead at the scene. Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers did assist after the crash in Mecklenburg County, but were not involved in the pursuit.

The Cabarrus County Sheriffs Office has not released what initially led them to pull Williams over.
