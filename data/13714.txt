A San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office review of a fatal November 2013 officer-involved shooting concluded San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department deputies’ use of force was justified under the circumstances, according to a report issued Tuesday, Feb. 16.

On Nov. 18, 2013, Chino Hills sheriff’s deputies were called to a residence at 7:52 pm on Tern Street after a woman told a dispatcher that her boyfriend, Peter John Oien, 47, may be under the influence of methamphetamine and was stabbing himself in the chest with a kitchen knife, according to the district attorney’s staff memo.

They ordered Oien, who was covered in blood, to drop two knives, but instead he came out of a bedroom charging at deputies with knife-wielding hands raised. Fearing for their safety and lives of themselves and others, they fired their weapons at Oien and he fell to the ground, according to the memo.

Oien was taken to Chino Valley Hospital, where he later died. Before she called for help, the girlfriend said Oien kept repeating that he “wanted to die,” had been depressed, suffered from medical and mental health issues and had been talking about committing suicide.

The involved officers were identified as deputies Julius McChristian and Hector Tobar and Sgt. Jason Hendrix.
