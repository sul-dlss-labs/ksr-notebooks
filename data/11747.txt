"Six. Six months. And I mean, he can get probation and get out," said Deloise's friend, Sherry Farmer. "I mean, a person killed a dog got more time than that."

(WMC-TV) - A former Memphis police officer pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and aggravated assault after a car wreck that killed two people and injured one.

As part of the plea deal, Alex Beard was sentenced to six months in jail and six years probation.

Records indicate Beard was on duty, driving his squad car 94 miles per hour five seconds before the accident. He was still going more than 60 MPH .1 second before impact. Deloise Epps and 12-year-old Mackala Ross died in the wreck while Mackala's father, Michael Ross, was seriously injured.

Now that a plea deal was agreed upon, Ross and his family are now in agony all over again.

"This is a slap in my face," said Michael Ross, who is still recovering from the crash.

"Six. Six months. And I mean, he can get probation and get out," said Deloise's friend, Sherry Farmer. "I mean, a person killed a dog got more time than that."

Defense attorney Leslie Ballin says Beard never intended to hurt anyone and that his client is remorseful.

"Justice, in my humble opinion, was probably reached today," said Ballin. "The sign of a good resolution is that neither side is totally satisfied with the result."

Prosecutors acknowledge that the victims' families were never on board with the deal, but say even a conviction could have resulted in straight probation with no jail time.

"I understand," said Prosecutor Billy Bond. "If I were in their situation, I wouldn't think that it was justice either."

He continued, "In the end, this was the best that could be done."

But Michael Ross disagrees.

"That's b-------. That ain't the best they can do," he said. "This ain't no kinda justice. This is injustice."

Alex Beard is free for now. He will report to jail on September 17 at 9 a.m. to begin his sentence.
