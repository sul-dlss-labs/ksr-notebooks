On August 22, 2015, Subject De Veyra was involved in a one vehicle accident at the corner of Olive Street and Flora Street. Investigator Sulps and Investigator Doty, who were working off duty nearby, saw the accident and ran to the scene. Due to Subject De Veyra's behavior, the investigators placed him in handcuffs.

Once DFR Rescue 3 arrived, the subject was placed in the back of the ambulance where he became combative. The subject appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance. Rescue 3 transported Subject De Veyra to Baylor Hospital. Subject De Veyra remained combative with the hospital staff and assaulted a paramedic.

Shortly after this, Subject De Veyra died. Dallas Police officers arrived at, and worked, the accident scene. Dallas Police officers also responded to Baylor Hospital to assist with the offenses. No Dallas Police officers were involved, they are all witnesses. The Dallas County District Attorney representative, Mr. Randall Johnson, requested Dallas Police SIU investigate the incident.
