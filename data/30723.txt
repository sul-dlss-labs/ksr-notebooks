COEUR d'ALENE - A man police say had repeated threatening contact with a Coeur d'Alene family over the past year was found dead in his Carrington Lane residence after gunshots with police were apparently exchanged Friday.

According to a Coeur d'Alene Police press release issued Saturday, Hayden McIlvain had repeatedly violated a no-contact order with the family and their minor children. Police records show several criminal reports over the past year against McIlvain, including stalking and witness intimidation.

Police said that on Friday, McIlvain violated the no-contact order again by showing up at the family's residence and making threatening comments. He had multiple weapons with him, police said.

After CDA police moved the family to safety, the press release said, officers went to McIlvain's residence with a warrant for first degree stalking.

"McIlvain was not compliant and indicated he would not be arrested," the press release said. "He also made several statements about 'shooting it out' with officers. Officers worked for several hours, unsuccessfully, to try to resolve the incident without force."



When McIlvain barricaded inside his house, SWAT officers from multiple agencies responded to the scene, police said. At some point, it was reported that a shot was fired from inside the residence toward the surrounding officers.

A Coeur d’Alene Police Officer fired one shot at the suspect, police said, and McIlvain was later found dead inside his residence.



According to the press release, the Northern Idaho Critical Incident Task Force was contacted to investigate the incident. The Kootenai County Sheriff’s Office is the lead investigating agency.

No further information was available Saturday.
