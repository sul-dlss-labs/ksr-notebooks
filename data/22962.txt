A 50-year-old Crystal man died Saturday afternoon when his motorcycle crashed on Interstate 494 at Hwy. 169 after a police chase, according to the State Patrol.

Christopher Lee Sundholm was speeding south on Hwy. 100 just before 3 p.m. by an Edina police officer who gave chase, the patrol said. The cycle fled west on 494 traveling more than 100 miles per hour, according to Edina police. The officer stopped the pursuit near West Bush Lake Road after losing sight of the vehicle.

As the cycle sought to exit on Hwy. 169 south, it hit a concrete barrier. Sundholm was thrown off onto 494 and died at the scene, the patrol said.

It was the second fatal motorcycle crash in Bloomington this week. Late Wednesday, motorcyclist Andrew J. Fisher, 27, of Prior Lake, died in a crash while being chased by police.

Also Saturday, authorities released the names of two motorcyclists who died last week in Minnesota crashes.

Craig M. Cassman, 56, of Rochester, was killed Thursday when his bike collided with a dump truck on Hwy. 16 near Hokah, in southeastern Minnesotaâ€™s Houston County.

Cassman was on a westbound 2012 Honda motorcycle that was hit head-on in the eastbound lane by an eastbound 1991 Ford dump truck at 2:34 p.m. Thursday. The truck driver, James H. Botcher, 83, of Houston, Minn., was not hurt.

Robert G. Bloom, 21, of White Bear Lake, died Wednesday when his motorcycle was struck by a sport-utility vehicle at an Apple Valley intersection.

The SUV driver ran a stop sign and hit him at 155th street and Embry Path, authorities said. The motorist, Sharat Koppula, 41, of Rosemount, may face charges. Police say he cooperated with authorities and did not appear to be impaired by drugs or alcohol.
