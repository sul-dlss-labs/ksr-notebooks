GULFPORT, Mississippi -- A 53-year-old Gulfport man died after being tasered by a Gulfport police officer outside a popular coast restaurant.

According to Gulfport Sgt. Damon McDaniel, officers were summoned to Shaggy's on east Beach Boulevard Sunday afternoon around 4:30 in reference to an male subject behaving erratically/disorderly inside the restaurant.

When they arrived, officers learned the man -- later identified as Bradford Macomber of Gulfport -- had gone outside. They located the subject, but Macomber resisted the officers, prompting one of them to subdue Macomber with a taser.

Police took Macomber into custody and handcuffed him, but the erratic behavior continue and paramedics were called to the scene. He was transported to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove released Macomber's identity Monday and said an autopsy would be performed, with the results turned over to the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, which will investigate the case along with the Harrison County District Attorney's Office.
