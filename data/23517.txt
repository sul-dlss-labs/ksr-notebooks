POCATELLO — Bingham County Prosecuting Attorney Cleve Colson announced Friday that no criminal charges will be filed against police in the Dec. 22 officer-involved shooting that left 62-year-old Laurence McClellan dead.

The Bingham County/City of Blackfoot Joint Detectives Division received a detailed account of what happened from police, and compiled a report, photos and audio recordings to hand over to Colson.

“I have concluded that the shooting was a justified use of deadly force necessitated by the threat Mr. Laurence McClellan posed to a Bannock County Deputy and a Pocatello Police Officer and the public,” Colson said.

Pocatello Police say the incident started with a hit and run report around 7:30 p.m. Officers say a Ford pickup hit four or five cars on Fairmont Avenue. They tracked the Ford to McClellan’s home on 1540 Homer Drive in Pocatello.

A woman in the home confirmed that the car belonged to McClellan. The woman led police into McClellan’s room, where he was sitting on the bed holding a black handgun. McClellan pointed the gun in the direction of officers, who immediately left the home. The woman also left safely at a later time.

Police set up a perimeter to keep the officers and the pubic safe, and a trained PPD negotiator began speaking with McClellan over the phone. Bannock County Deputies and an Idaho State Police Trooper responded to assist PPD.

Around 8:30 p.m., McClellan walked out the back door of the house and raised his gun in the direction of a Bannock County Deputy and a PPD Officer. Both gave McClellan commands, but he continued to point his gun at the Deputy and Officer.

At 8:33 p.m., a Bannock County Deputy shot three times at McClellan. He died at the scene after lifesaving efforts were performed from officers and an ambulance crew.
