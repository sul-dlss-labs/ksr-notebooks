A 41-year-old Helena man who was hospitalized following a Sunday altercation with law enforcement officers has died, according to Lewis and Clark County Coroner Mickey Nelson.

Roger Chandler died early this morning at a Great Falls hospital, he said.

Nelson said an autopsy will be performed this afternoon but it will be weeks if not months before toxicology and other testing results will be completed.

A coroner's inquest will be held concerning the death.

Chandler was transported from St. Peter's Hospital to Great Falls late Monday night following an incident in which a Taser was used twice to subdue him.

Lewis and Clark County sheriff's deputies and Montana Highway Patrol officers were responding to a report of a man acting violently at a residence on Ross Road. They tried to talk the man out of a camper next to the home, then eventually used a Taser to bring him into protective custody.

Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton said Chandler continued to be combative after the Taser was first used, so he was stunned again and restrained.

Chandler became unresponsive eight minutes later. Officers began CPR, which was continued as he was transported to St. Peter's Hospital.

Dutton noted the officers responded appropriately and that he suspected a substance caused Chandler's erratic behavior.

As a matter of protocol when serious injury or death is a result, Dutton has called in state detectives from the Criminal Investigations Division to conduct an inquiry.

Dutton said a total of five sheriff's deputies and two troopers responded to the incident. He declined to release the names of any of the officers involved.
