A family is now looking for answers. Their loved one died following an incident with Colorado Springs police.

Jeffrey Melvin was brought to UCHealth Memorial Hospital on April 26th. His family members say they did not find out he was there until Tuesday.

"We all knew, we just have a feeling somethings not right," Jeffrey’s sister Taneesha Melvin said. "My brother's always over here.”

Taneesha says she got a Facebook message Tuesday from a social worker letting her know he was at the hospital.

"We got to the hospital, my family. When we got there we were just stunned. The doctors were saying, his nerves were damaged. A doctor said it could be consistent with tazing to his body,” Taneesha Melvin said.

They said they rushed to be by his side, but on Thursday, he died.

When they got there, police say there was no disturbance. But they say one of the men eventually ran into the apartment, tried to barricade the door and then started fighting with officers. Police say they shocked him with a stun gun and pepper sprayed another man.

Jeffrey's friend Jordan was there.

"He tried to get away and jump out the window. They pulled him back in. Then immediately he asked for my help, when I tried to help him out the cops pepper sprayed me, they kept on tazing my friend. Just to hear somebody screaming and hearing it again, and again, and again. I've heard shots before but I've never seen somebody tased so many times in my life,” Jordan told 11 News.

Police say they are not releasing any information at this time because it's an active investigation. They are waiting for information from the coroner's office.

Jeffrey leaves behind four children.

"I'm just saddened, I'm angered. My nephews will now be without a father,” Taneesha Melvin said.

A Memorial Hospital representative said because of privacy laws, they cannot comment.
