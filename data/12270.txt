Oxford Police on Monday identified a man shot by police Friday in a mini-mall on Snow Street.

Anthony Scott Brown, 50, was killed after he threatened officers with a knife in Dr. Phonefix and Accessories store across from the Quintard Mall on Friday afternoon, police Chief Bill Partridge said. Partridge said Brown had recently graduated from the Oxford Tri-County Outreach drug and alcohol rehabilitation program; police are unsure where Brown had been living after his completion of the program. State records show Brownâ€™s last known address was in Gadsden.

Oxford police say that Friday, Jan. 18 they received a tip that Brown was inside the Mister PhoneFixit store in Oxford. After officers approached Brown and asked him to exit the store, Police Chief Bill Partridge says that Brown pulled a knife and lunged at one of the officers.

Officers used a Taser to try and subdue Brown, but to no effect. Partridge says that an officer then shot and killed Brown.
