A man who was in custody of Fountain police became unresponsive and was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The incident happened Monday morning while police were investigating a disturbance call in the 1500 block of Prado Dr., near Carson Boulevard and Highway 85.

Police said the man, identified as Jeremy Thompson, was being uncooperative. While being placed into custody "he became unresponsive and required medical attention," police said.

Thompson was then taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Because he died while in police custody, Fountain police asked Colorado Springs police to help investigate.

Police said the investigation was ongoing and did not release any other information.
