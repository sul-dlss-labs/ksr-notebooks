The Los Angeles County Coroner’s Office identified the man who led police on a chase before fatally shooting himself in north Long Beach Thursday afternoon.

He is 21-year-old Marquis Jackson. His city of residence was not known to coroner’s officials late Saturday.

The incident began at about 1 p.m. Thursday, when a CHP officer tried to conduct a traffic stop for a carpool violation on the eastbound 91 Freeway, west of Long Beach Boulevard.

Police said Jackson, driving a gold Ford Taurus, exited the freeway at Long Beach Boulevard and ran a red light. After traveling at a slow speed, he suddenly sped up and drove off.

The CHP officer pursued him for three to four minutes before the Ford crashed into a cinder block wall at South Street and Cherry Avenue.

Jackson exited his vehicle and ran eastbound on South Street. When the CHP officer attempted to contact him, he turned and fired a handgun at the officer, who took cover behind his motorcycle. Jackson fled southbound between businesses on South Street and out of the officer’s line of sight.

Long Beach police report they received calls from businesses in the area, describing a man trying to rob employees at gunpoint and carjack a vehicle as he tried to run from officers on foot.

A short time later, police found Jackson lying near railroad tracks north of Market Street with a handgun nearby. Long Beach firefighters pronounced him dead at the scene from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot injury.
