A 47-year-old shotgun-wielding man who was shot by a Kenosha County sheriff's deputy Saturday has died, authorities said Sunday.

The Sheriff's Department identified the man as Darren Myron Fude of Paddock Lake. He died in the emergency room at St. Catherine's Medical Center Campus, according to a news release.

The Sheriff's Department said the man was shot shortly before 6:30 p.m. Saturday by a deputy after confronting officers with a shotgun in Paddock Lake and refusing to drop the weapon when ordered to do so.

The Kenosha News reported that Fude had been in a motorcycle accident and the confrontation occurred when deputies went to his house to investigate.

The deputy has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the state Justice Department's Division of Criminal Investigation.
