A police chase in Parke County ends in a fatal crash.

On Friday, August 25th at 12:16 PM, an officer just coming on duty observed a suspicious vehicle and subject on Voorhees St. in Rockville and ran the plate.

The vehicle returned as stolen from the previous day from Terre Haute.

Officers immediately started looking for the vehicle again and located it in front of the parking lot at Burger King at the intersection of US 36 and US 41. A Rockville officer from the Sheriff’s Office approached the rear of the vehicle in his marked vehicle and started to pull in front of the subject.

The vehicle then pulled out at a high rate of speed east on US 36, with two marked police vehicles with the emergency lights activated in pursuit, reaching speeds in excess of 80 MPH across the Town square and through two red lights, and continued east accelerating in excess of 100 MPH as it crossed Sill St.

At the top of Billie Creek Hill just west of Nyesville Rd, the suspect was passing a semi in the no passing zone with oncoming traffic and lost control of the vehicle in loose gravel on the north side of the roadway. It then went off into a wooded area striking several trees and rolled onto the passenger’s side of the vehicle.

The lone occupant was not wearing a seat belt and was partially ejected into some trees.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene by the Parke County Coroner.

An autopsy will be performed Saturday and the identity of the driver is not being released at this time pending notification of all family members. The identity of the driver is known and it was found that he had pending warrants for his arrest for Auto Theft out of Vigo County as well as a warrant for a Parole Violation.
