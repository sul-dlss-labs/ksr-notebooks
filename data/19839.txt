CASPER, Wyo. (AP) â€” Authorities say a 22-year-old man has died after a vehicle led police on a high-speed chase and crashed in southeast Wyoming.

Nathan Pieper died after the Friday crash in Laramie. The Casper man was a passenger in a vehicle driven by 21-year-old Tyler Lane, who was arrested on suspicion of aggravated vehicular homicide and driving while impaired.

The Wyoming Highway Patrol says a Laramie officer tried stopping the Ford Mustang that Lane was driving because the vehicle's headlights were not on.

Authorities say Lane eluded the officer and struck a piece of wood while trying to use an Interstate 80 on-ramp.

The car slid, left the roadway and rolled.

Pieper was ejected from the vehicle and taken to a hospital where he died.

Lane and another 21-year-old passenger were hospitalized and later released.
