LOUISVILLE (WAVE) -- One year ago on January 6th, 11-year-old Demetra Boyd was killed after a suspect fleeing an officer slammed into the car she was riding in. Family and friends returned to the scene of the crash on the anniversary of her death to hold a vigil in her honor. WAVE 3's Lindsay English was there.

The remembrance ceremony was held at the intersection of First and Breckinridge, where Donta Jones, ran a red light while fleeing police. He struck a car full of children, including Demetra Boyd, who did not survive.

Her two half brothers and four cousins were also injured in the crash. Those young survivors attended Sunday's vigil to honor Demetra's memory.

Demetra's uncle, Terrance Randolph, says hearing Donta Jones apologize for his actions during his sentencing has helped the family move forward

"We do accept his apology," Randolph said. "I've talked with his mother and sister and other relatives in our family and we have learned to accept his apology. And we want him to know we are praying for him."

On Friday, several members of Demetra's family filed a wrongful death civil lawsuit, naming LMPD Officer Thomas Pugh for pursuing Donta Jones.

Demetra's own father, who was driving, was also named in the suit because there were seven people riding in a car designed for five, and none of the children were wearing seatbelts.
