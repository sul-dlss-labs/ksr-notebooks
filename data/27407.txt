ARVADA, Colo. â€” A man is dead after being shot by Arvada police officers Wednesday night following a call for a possible domestic violence situation, police spokesman David Snelling said.

No officers were injured.

The shooting happened near West 56th Avenue and Marshall Street, which is between Sheridan Boulevard and Wadsworth Boulevard.

Just after 10 p.m. Wednesday, officers were advised a man was attempting to break into an apartment.

When officers arrived on scene, the man, later identified as Jon Phillip Bryant, 40, had left the home.

Police located him about two blocks away and when they approached him, Bryant was armed with a pipe and was threatening suicide by cop, Arvada police said. Officers attempted to use less lethal force in order to place Bryant into custody including a baton and Taser, but their attempts had no effect on the suspect.

Bryant then armed himself with a knife and ran at officers. Bryant was shot by law enforcement and pronounced deceased on scene, Arvada police said.

Five officers discharged their weapons to stop the threat.

Prior to police arriving, police learned Bryant had broken out apartment windows in the building and had assaulted his girlfriend. Bryant has over 30 contacts recorded with the Arvada Police Department alone, the department said.

The Jefferson County Regional Critical Incident Response Team is conducting an investigation per procedure.
