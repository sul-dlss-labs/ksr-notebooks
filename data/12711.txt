Crime & Safety Officer Cleared in Fatal Shooting of St. Pete Woman A state attorney has said Officer Christopher Dolch was justified in his shooting of Pamela Dale Kirk. Reply

A St. Petersburg Police officer has been cleared by a Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney in the April 28 shooting death of Pamela Dale Kirk.

State attorney Bernie McCabe wrote in his ruling: "As a result of the investigation conducted by this office, I have determined that Officer Christopher Dolch was in the lawful performance of his legal duty when he responded to a call for a welfare check on Pamela Dale Kirk. When Pamela Dale Kirk pointed a firearm at Officer Dolch he had reason to believe that his life (was in danger)

"It is the conclusion of the State Attorney's Office that the death of Pamela Dale Kirk was the result of having been shot by Officer Christopher Dolch in the performance of his legal duty and the shooting was justifiable homicide, pursuant to Florida Statute 776.012." Officers were originally called to Kirk's house on April 28 after a neighbor said she was acting suspicious when she asked her to look after her dog while crying.

According to the police report, officers knocked on the front door and tried to make contact with Kirk. When they were unsuccessful, Dolch went to the back door with the neighbor.

Police said Kirk pulled open the curtain by the back door and stood in the window. She was holding a silver revolver and mumbled something about a gun, the report said. According to the state attorney's report, Dolch saw Kirk raise her gun and point the barrel at him and said, "boom." That is when Dolch fired his gun three times at Kirk.
