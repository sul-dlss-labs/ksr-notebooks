MIAMI (CBSMiami) â€“ A knife wielding man was shot to death by a Miami-Dade police officer early Sunday morning.

Around 2 a.m. police were called to NE 144th Street and Dixie Highway where a fight had broken out at a large party.

When officers arrived they found 36-year old Timmie Williams armed with a knife and 50-year old John Fisher with stab wounds. When the officers demanded that Williams put down the knife, he refused.

"He did not comply and in fact attempted to stab another individual and that officer discharged his weapon," said police spokeswoman Lt. Rosanna Cordero-Stutz.

"The officer just got out of his car and went to shoot him," said a friend of Williams who only wished to be identified as Lulu. "They didn't tell him to freeze, they didn't tell him to do nothing."

Williams, who was out on parole for second degree murder, died on the scene. Fisher was taken to the hospital, he's expected to be okay.

Police have not said what led to the fight.
