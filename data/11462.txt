Kenneth Rivera III, a 27-year-old Latino died Thursday, June 21, in the 11500 block of Atlantic Avenue in Lynwood, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Lt. Ed Hernandez of the sheriff’s homicide bureau said the incident occurred about noon while deputies responded to the reported kidnapping of a 15-year-old girl.

Hernandez said the 27-year-old man was shot as he put his right hand into his front pocket and charged a deputy who was trying to park her patrol car after arriving first on the scene.

According to the Sheriff’s Department, the deputy fired several rounds from her pistol, striking the suspect in the upper body. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Hernandez said the officer thought the suspect was armed and feared for her safety. No weapon was found on the suspect.

The girl, who suffered minor injuries to her neck and chest, managed to escape before the shooting, Hernandez said.

As is standard procedure for an officer-involved shooting, the incident is being investigated by the sheriff’s homicide bureau, the sheriff’s internal affairs unit, the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office and the Los Angeles County coroner’s office. The review will determine whether the deputy committed a crime or violated official procedures involving the use of deadly force.

Anyone with additional information about the shooting is asked to contact Sgt. Clark at the sheriff’s homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
