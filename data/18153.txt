SANDUSKY, Ohio -- The State Highway Patrol is investigating the death of a 48-year-old Fairport Harbor man who troopers said shot himself during a traffic stop in Northwest Ohio early Friday.

Douglas L. Kapel died from a gunshot wound to the chest about 1:30 a.m. on State Route 2 near Port Clinton, the state patrol said.

A trooper pulled Kapel over for speeding. Kapel told the trooper his license was suspended and a records search found Kapel had felony warrants right before the shooting.

The state trooper called an Ottawa County sheriff's deputy for assistance. When the two officers approached Kapel's car, he was slumped over and they saw blood on Kapel's shirt.

The officers rendered first aid and chest compressions until paramedics arrived, but they were unable to resuscitate Kapel. He was pronounced dead at the scene.
