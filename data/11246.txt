NATCHITOCHES PARISH, LA (KSLA) - The suspect in the shooting of a Shreveport woman late Monday night has died, police say of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Louisiana State Police confirm that 47-year-old O. B. Mitchell, Jr. fatally shot himself, following an hour-long chase that began in Caddo Parish, continued through DeSoto Parish, and ended just outside of Alexandria in Natchitoches Parish.

State police picked up the chase in DeSoto Parish. Officers were advised that Mitchell was armed and dangerous, and reported seeing him reaching under his seat even as he headed southbound in a 2011 Nissan Altima on I-49 at speeds of 90 to 125 miles per hour. Mitchell was able to avoid the first set of spike strips deployed by officers. A second set was deployed near mile marker 119. At that point, Louisiana State Police Trooper Scott Moreau says the car slowed down to 55 mph and headed into the median. That's where officers say it appears Mitchell took his own life.

Mitchell was a suspect in the shooting of 32-year-old Lakesha Robinson, the mother of his child. Shreveport police say the two were involved in an argument in the 1300 block of Lawhon Street when he shot her in the lower abdomen and fled. Robinson ran across the street to a neighbor's house to call for help and was taken to LSU Health, where she is listed in fair condition.

Police also say a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old were present at the time of Robinson's shooting.
