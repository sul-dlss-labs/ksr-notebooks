It happened about three years ago in Lapeer County. Herrington says Lara and Marcel Stutz were happily married at first -- but as time went on, he became verbally abusive.

"He was manipulative, demanding, he was all about 'me,' 'I'm number one' stuff, and about a year or so before this incident happened, my daughter and him had kind of a wrestling match - he wanted to get the phone away from her," said Herrington.

Marcel was arrested after that incident and had to attend anger management classes and go to AA meetings.

But Herrington says things just got worse from there.

In December of 2011, Michigan State Police responded to a domestic violence call, discovering two people dead and a young boy wounded.

When police arrived at that scene that night at the house on Palmer Street in Imlay City, officers could hear gunshots.

Once inside, they found Lara Stutz, 43, and her husband, Marcel Stutz, 42, both fatally shot.

The couple's three children were found inside an upstairs bathroom. One of them, a 9-year-old boy, had been shot in the leg.

Herrington's message to domestic abuse victims -- seek help immediately.
