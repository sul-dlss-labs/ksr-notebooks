Authorities say a suspected drunk driver fleeing from San Bernardino police hit a car and killed a woman inside.

The high-speed pursuit began Sunday morning when officers saw a traffic violation.

Police Lt. Jarrod Burguan says the driver of the Lincoln Towncar did not stop when officers tried to pull him over and the chase ended in neighboring Rialto, where the sedan collided with a Honda Accord, killing 40-year-old passenger Margarita Rodriguez-Dominguez.

The Honda’s driver and two other passengers were injured.

Burguan says police arrested the Lincoln’s 19-year-old driver Johnny Morales on suspicion of murder.

A sheriff’s deputy reached early Monday did not know if Morales had hired an attorney.
