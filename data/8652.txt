— Authorities say a man shot by a Fort Smith police officer has died at a Fort Smith hospital.

Officials say 28-year-old Justin Morehead was shot Wednesday evening by officer Cory Calhoun after pointing a weapon at Calhoun.

Sgt. Levi Risley says the officer was responding to a report of a man on a city bus with a gun. The bus driver faked a breakdown to wait for police and Morehead got off the bus before being approached by Calhoun.

Police say Morehead pulled one gun that Calhoun was able to take away — then produced a second weapon and was shot by the officer.

Calhoun is on paid leave pending an investigation.
