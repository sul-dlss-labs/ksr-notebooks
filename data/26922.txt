The Sacramento County Sheriff's Office has released 911 calls and surveillance video of the violent chain of events in Carmichael that ended with deputies opening fire on a man who shot and killed a woman in front of them. Earnest Easterling, 25, and a 23-year-old woman were killed early Oct. 27, authorities said. The sheriff's office said it received a call around 12:30 a.m. from someone in the 5800 block of Angelina Avenue who said a vehicle had smashed into a tree and that a man who had been in the car was seen waving a gun. Additional callers reported that they saw a man and woman arguing. On private surveillance video released by the sheriff's office, a man, later identified as Easterling, is seeing pulling the woman, who the sheriff's office said was Easterling's girlfriend, toward an apartment and assaulting her while holding a gun. “You got the police called on me!” he’s heard shouting in the video. “Hey, on my mama, when they come, I’m blasting you!” While the assault was happening, neighbors helped women and children in the nearby apartment get to a place of safety next door, according to the sheriff's office. “None of these events or details were reported to the sheriff’s office at the time they were occurring. Deputies were unaware of the gravity of the circumstances as they arrived on scene," said Sgt. Tess Deterding in a narrated video the sheriff's office released about the shootings. Easterling left the area and returned a few minutes later. He had replaced the standard magazine in his handgun with a 50-round drum magazine, the sheriff's office said. Three deputies got to the scene around 12:40 a.m. A woman ran from the apartment and directed the responding deputies to the doorway where Easterling and the victim were standing. The woman told the deputies that Easterling was armed. On the surveillance video, the victim is seen walking away from the doorway with her hands in the air. The deputies are heard telling her to get out of the doorway. As she slowly moves away from the apartment, Easterling is seen running toward the victim and shooting her in front of the deputies. All three deputies fired their weapons at Easterling, “attempting to stop him from killing the female victim," Deterding says in the narrated video. Both Easterling and the victim were declared dead. A Glock handgun with a 50-round drum attached was recovered from the scene, the sheriff's office said. The firearm was legally purchased, authorities said. *** If you or someone you know needs help, you can call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233, TTY 1-800-787-3224 or you can chat online here. ***
