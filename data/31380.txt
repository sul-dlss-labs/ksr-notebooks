Smith lost control of the car on Michigan Avenue. Tire tracks visible throughout the park where the crash occurred lead to Bunker Hill Road, where the car came to rest. The impact caused Smith to be ejected and he died at the scene.

Police said Smith lost control of the car at the same time a supervisor cancelled the pursuit per department policy, which only allows pursuits when a felony has occurred.

Investigators said the crash happened about 43 seconds after Smith allegedly ran from the traffic stop. Internal affairs are investigating the circumstances surrounding the fatal crash to see if department policy was violated.

County police have placed an officer on administrative leave as the investigation continues.
