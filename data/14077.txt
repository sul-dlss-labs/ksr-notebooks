SOLON, Ohio -- Police say a Cleveland man died this morning after losing control of his car and being ejected from it while fleeing from a traffic stop.

A Solon police news release said the man -- later identified as 42-year-old Edward Perry -- was stopped around 2:20 a.m. by police at the intersection of Arthur and S.O.M. Center roads on suspicion that he was driving while intoxicated.

The release said that as the officer approached, the driver restarted the 2008 Chevrolet Impala and headed west on Arthur.

Police said the officer lost sight of the car as it went over a hill, even before the officer returned to the cruiser. A search by police found the car overturned on a front yard on Arthur. The driver had been thrown from the Impala.

Police said they believe the driver lost control after driving through a traffic island. The man was taken to Hillcrest Hospital, where he died.

Solon police said he was driving with a suspended license.
