WATCH BRIEFING:

LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A man who was having a mental episode, according to his wife, was shot and killed by police Sunday afternoon. Metro Police shared additional details regarding the shooting during a briefing held Tuesday afternoon.

Police say the shooting happened in a residential area around 4:20 p.m. in the 2800 block of Cygnus Street, near Cimarron and Sahara.

LVMPD says dispatchers received a call from a woman who said her husband, later identified as 67-year-old Jeffrey Hubbard, was having a “mental episode” and was making politically-charged statements. Prior to officers’ arrival, Hubbard had fired a gun three times, causing his wife to run outside.

Once police arrived on scene, they tried to talk to Hubbard and deescalate the situation. Officers who are CIT-certified, trained to help subjects who are suffering from mental illness or substance abuse, were at the scene.

He then came out of the house holding a handgun.

“After several minutes of attempting to communicate with Mr. Hubbard, he exited the residence concealing his left arm behind his back,” LVMPD said. They issued commands, but he did not comply.

According to police, Hubbard then raised his left hand and pointed the gun at officers.

Two LVMPD officers then fired multiple rounds, striking him.
