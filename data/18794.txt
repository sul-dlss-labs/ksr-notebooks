LYNNWOOD, Wash. — Both directions of Highway 99 are closed after a man was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Lynnwood.

Lynnwood police said the shooting happened near the 19200 block of Highway 99 shortly before 10 a.m. Monday.

Highway 99 is closed in both directions between 118th Street Southwest and 196th Street Southwest.

Video from Chopper 7 showed a body covered by a sheet in the middle of the street. It will not be removed until the medical examiner arrives.

An official source told reporter Joanna Small that the suspect had been in one of the stores along the highway. He was wearing a backpack and made references to both ISIS and the fact he had weapons.

He then ran down Highway 99 and was darting in and out of traffic while holding a knife.

A witness who saw the incident unfold described the interaction between that man and a Lynnwood police officer.

"(Police said), 'Stop! Put the knife down.' He never listen. He's running and the police maybe three times tell him to stop. No listen. That's why the police, I think, shoot," said the witness.

The man died at the scene.

Three Lynnwood police officers were involved in the incident with the man, but only one officer fired. That officer, who fired at the man multiple times, has been on the force for three years.
