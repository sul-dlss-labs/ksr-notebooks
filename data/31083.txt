The barricaded gunman who shot a Brockton police officer “several times” later fatally shot himself Thursday night, according to police.

Investigators also found a dead male gunshot victim in an SUV near the chaotic scene on Taber Avenue.

The wounded officer was rushed to Boston Medical Center and is expected to survive.

Brockton Police responded to 62 Taber Ave., at around 5:45 p.m., after they received reports of a male with a gun. Police officers arrived, and gunshots were fired, according to the Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office.

“A Brockton police officer was struck, several times,” the DA’s Office said in a statement.

The gunman then went into the home, where he remained holed up for several hours as police tried to negotiate with the barricaded suspect.

The gunman was apparently outside the home at about 9:30 p.m. when he shot himself, police said.

He was transported to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The Brockton police officer, gunman and male gunshot victim are not being identified at this time.

Police said this does not appear to be a random act of violence.
