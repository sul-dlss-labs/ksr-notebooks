A 16-year-old pedestrian died Monday after being struck by a Metro Transit Police K-9 unit vehicle in Maryland, officials say.

Maryland State Police say a police officer and his K-9 partner were traveling in their marked vehicle in Brandywine when it collided with the pedestrian, who was crossing the roadway.

Investigators say it happened on northbound Crain Highway (Route 301) at Chadds Ford Drive just before 1 p.m. Monday.

The victim's identity remains unknown at this time, police say.

Maryland State Police have identified the officer as Gary L. Bottalico, who is assigned to the department's K-9 unit. The Metro Transit Police officer and his fellow K-9 were not injured during the incident.

Police say Officer Bottalico was off duty and was on his way to work when the pedestrian collision happened.

Bottalico has been placed on routine administrative paid leave.

Crain Highway was temporarily closed for five hours after the crash as Maryland State Police's CRASH team investigated the incident.

Anyone who witness the fatal collision is asked to call the Forestville Barrack at 301-568-8101.
