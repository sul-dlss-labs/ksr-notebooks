Phoenix police officers have identified the suspect in an officer-involved shooting Saturday in which he held his ex-girlfriend hostage for several hours and shot at police, officials said.

The suspect was identified as 46-year-old Kevin Thomas Snyder, officials said.

The incident began at about 1 a.m. Saturday when the woman returned to her house in the area of 42nd and Morten avenues to discover her alarm system was beeping inside her home. As she attempted to disarm the beeping on the alarm key pad, the woman's ex-boyfriend approached her from behind with a revolver and pulled her into the house, said a Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Trent Crump.

According to Crump, the woman had moved to the neighborhood to escape her ex-boyfriend.

She was held hostage at gunpoint for about six hours inside the home until she managed to use a silent alarm key pad inside the house to alert officers, Crump said.

Responding officers arrived at the house about 7 a.m. and heard the woman screaming inside the home. They were able to get her out of the house and take her to a safe location and began looking for Snyder.

Members of tactical teams, including K-9 officers, found Snyder hiding inside a nearby house's carport-accessible laundry room.

When Snyder was discovered by the police dog, officers at the scene gave verbal commands for him to drop his weapon. Crump said that when a K-9 officer entered the room, Snyder pointed the revolver at him, at which point the officer shot Snyder.

Crump added Sunday that Snyder was later found to have an active felony warrant for a probation violation connected to aggravated assault.
