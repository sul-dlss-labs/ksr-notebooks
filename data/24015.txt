A man died Tuesday afternoon after being shot by a Huntsville police officer.

Around 4:25 p.m., Huntsville police were called to the 6400 block of Deramus Avenue by a man named Jeffery Louis Parker, who said he was suicidal and had a gun. When police arrived, they saw Parker holding the gun.

According to Lt. Michael Johnson, officers briefly talked with Parker once on the scene and commanded him to drop the gun. The altercation led to one of the officers firing at the 49-year-old man.

Parker was pronounced dead a short time later.

The three officers who responded to the scene have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard through department policy. Johnson said there is video of the incident from the officer's body cameras, and within the next two weeks an Incident Review Board will examine whether the officer followed training and policy standards. The board consists of members from the Madison County District Attorney's Office, Huntsville City Attorney's Office, and the police department's Citizen Advisory Council.
