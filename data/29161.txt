A woman was shot in the head by her boyfriend before he turned the gun on himself Wednesday night, Akron police said.

Police said the couple's child was in the home and was unharmed. The woman was in serious condition Wednesday night.

Officers responded to a home in the 400 block of Cross Street for a report of a domestic-related shooting at about 8:15 p.m. Police established a perimeter and tried to communicate with a 30-year-old male suspect who was behind the home armed with a handgun.

Additional officers went inside the home and found a 30-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the head. Her 2-year-old son was with her.

Police said both were quickly removed from the home. The woman, who was conscious and breathing at the time, received treatment from emergency medical personnel and was taken to Summa Akron City Hospital.

Police said officers who encountered the man tried to defuse the situation but the man shot himself in the head. The man was taken to Cleveland Clinic Akron General, where he later died.

Police said none of the officers on the scene used their weapons. The Summit County Medical Examiner's Office is investigating the man's death as a suicide.

Detectives determined the man shot the woman during an argument and later called a relative to report the shooting.

Police said there was not an update on the woman's condition Thursday.

The identities of the man and woman have not been released.
