A plainclothes police officer was shot twice and seriously wounded last night in a gunfight in Harlem with a suspect who was killed, the authorities said. The officer was hospitalized and expected to survive.

The gunfight broke out about 9:30 p.m. after the officer, Robert Tejada, 35, approached the suspect with three other officers at a small restaurant on Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard near West 136th Street called Café 22, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said.

Mr. Kelly said that a four-man team from the Police Department’s Anti-Crime Unit had been dispatched to the cafe after a detective who had been following the suspect for some time as part of a continuing investigation radioed his colleagues that the suspect had been seen with a gun.

When the officers entered the restaurant, Mr. Kelly said, they frisked the suspect, and discovered a 9-millimeter pistol. But a struggle began, Mr. Kelly said, in which the suspect managed to draw the gun and shoot Officer Tejada once in the chest and once in the ankle. The officers returned fire, shooting the suspect four times. He was taken to Harlem Hospital Center, where he died about two hours later.
