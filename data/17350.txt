GAUTIER, Mississippi -- The suspect shot dead in a shootout with Gautier police Tuesday night has been identified.

Jackson County Deputy Coroner Jason Moody said the man killed was 37-year-old Mickey Dewayne Sweatt of Gautier. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday.

The shooting stemmed from a call of a domestic disturbance received by the Gautier Police Department on Home of Grace Road shortly before 7 p.m. Tuesday. When police arrived on the scene, witnesses advised they had heard yelling and gunfire coming from the home and officers set up a perimeter around the area.

During a roughly two-hour standoff, police attempted to negotiate with the suspect over the phone, but to no avail. Ultimately, the suspect fired on the officers, who returned fire and killed the suspect.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is taking the lead on the case, which is standard procedure in any officer-involved shooting. Results from the MBI investigation will be turned over to the Jackson County District Attorney's Office for review.
