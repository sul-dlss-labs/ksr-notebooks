I pray for our victims. I am also inspired by the bravery shown by units yesterday, as they were immediately met with rifle fire (a round lodging in the headrest). An example of the dangers our officers face daily, as they respond to tragedy. Be safe my brothers and sisters. pic.twitter.com/FRHDCeyvjF — Eddie Garcia (@DPDChiefGarcia) February 8, 2021

Police identified them Monday as Tamiko Merriwether, 55, her daughter Marietta Matthews, 26, and Nathan Rashad James, 24. Matthews was in a relationship with James and lived with him at the apartment, police said.

Police said the women died from gunshot wounds and James died from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The police department’s special investigations unit will conduct a follow-up investigation, police said.
