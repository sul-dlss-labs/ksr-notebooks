Christopher Coronel, a 21-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by police Wednesday, May 25, in the 9800 block of San Miguel Avenue in South Gate, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Police responded about 7:10 p.m. to a residence. Coronel had called South Gate police to say he had stabbed himself 20 times.

When officers arrived, Coronel who was outside, claimed he had a gun and ran indoors. Soon after, Coronel ran outside holding a knife, according to an incident report.

Coronel attempted to enter a neighborâ€™s residence, but did not get inside. Officers fired a stunbag gun and a Taser, which they said did not subdue Coronel. Then, still holding the knife, he ran toward one or more officers, who shot him.

Coronel was pronounced dead at the scene. Coroner's records show he sustained several gunshot wounds, multiple self-inflicted stab wounds and abrasions from bean bags.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800-222-8477).
