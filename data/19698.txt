New video gives a new look at the moments before Cleveland Police opened fire on a 30-year-old man.

It was the department’s first fatal officer-involved shooting in more than two years when it happened in April 2017. It was also their first since the city entered into an agreement with the Department of Justice to reform its use of force.

The case continues to be scrutinized.

When officers arrived on Mapledale Ave., they knew there was trouble up the driveway. A man identified as 30-year old Jeffrey Findlay of North Ridgeville had just threatened his girlfriend, who ran to a neighbor’s house.

Audio from the new body camera video reveals officers ordering the suspect multiple times to obey.

“Jeffrey! Cleveland Police! Let me see your hands!” they say.

Within seconds, police have him in their sites and shine lights from two directions. Findlay, however, refuses to drop his gun and ignores their commands. Patrolman Rafael Carrucini and Sgt. Daniel Jopek then both open fire.

For Sgt. Jopek, it was not his first time, either. Two times in the early 2000’s, he shot and killed suspects in what began as traffic stops.

In the first case, the city settled a wrongful death lawsuit in the death of Stephon Moore. In the second case, Sergeant Jopek was cleared of wrongdoing in the death of Stanley Strnad.

Jopek later went on to receive a heroism award after rescuing a quadriplegic man trapped in his car.

Jeffrey Findlay was pronounced dead at the hospital. He had no prior criminal history aside from a DUI.
