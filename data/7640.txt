PHILADELPHIA (CBS) - The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office has filed numerous charges, including voluntary manslaughter, against two former police officers in connection with a fatal shooting in 2008.

DA Seth Williams is following the recommendations of a grand jury which spent nearly two years investigating the case against 39-year-old Chauncey Ellison, Sr. and his ex girlfriend, 44-year-old Robin Fortune.

Both officers were off-duty on November 17, 2008 when they drove around in search of a local teen who had stolen a pizza from the couple's two sons.

They found the suspect on the 1900 block of Renovo Street in front of Lawrence Allen's home.

Williams says when Ellison drew his gun, Allen stepped in and tried to be a peacemaker.

"He actually said to Sgt. Ellison, 'why do you have a gun out? All this over a pizza? I will give you money for the pizza. Let's just calm all this down'."

But witnesses told the grand jury that Ellison, who was egged on by his enraged girlfriend, shot Allen once in the back. The victim died nearly three months later.

Ellison faces 33-and-a-half to 67 years behind bars. Fortune is looking at charges of reckless endangerment and conspiracy and could go to prison for a minimum of 11 years.
