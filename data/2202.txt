A Chicago official said Tuesday that the city plans to appeal a $17.5 million judgment awarded to a Chinese immigrant whose pregnant wife was killed in a police chase two years ago.

A jury Monday assigned 75 percent of the liability for the crash that killed Qing Chang, 25, on Jan. 2, 2003 to the city--a view city attorneys strongly disagree with.

"Our position in this case is that the driver in the getaway vehicle is responsible for the death," said Jennifer Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city's Law Department.

The other 25 percent of liability was placed on Lakesha Smith, the driver of the vehicle that hit Chang.

Chang, a software programmer at ThoughtWorks Inc., was walking home from work and crossing the street at Desplaines and Madison Streets when she was hit by Smith's Dodge Intrepid. Smith was acting as the getaway driver after her two passengers, Tamika Wilson and Larry Scott, had stolen a wallet minutes before at a River North restaurant.

A police sergeant driving by the restaurant was told of the theft by a bartender and began pursuing the car. That sergeant ignored an order over the police radio from another sergeant to stop the chase, according to police.
