A man who died while fleeing from Reading police officers was driving an unregistered dirt bike, officials said.

Daniel Felix, 29, of Reading, was allegedly driving the off-road motorcycle erratically when police tried to pull him over near the 1000 block of Penn Street.

Police said Felix then drove further down the street before colliding with a vehicle and a curb, launching him from the bike. He died at the scene, according to investigators.

"It's a growing concern for us," said Chief Bill Heim in regard to off-road vehicles making their way into traffic. "It's a rather serious offense, and it's not something that's just a joyride."

Heim told 69 News the department has seen an increase of these offenses over the last couple of years.

"I think it's important that people realize how dangerous this is," said Heim.

In the case of Felix, police said there were no other injuries. An autopsy was scheduled Monday evening, and the investigation is ongoing.

By Monday morning, a candlelight memorial had been created near the scene on Penn Street.
