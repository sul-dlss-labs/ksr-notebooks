District Attorney Stephan Passalacqua on Friday cleared the three deputies of any wrongdoing in the May 2007 death of Luis Felipe Sanchez. The ruling capped a lengthy investigation that prosecutors say involved an extensive forensic analysis.

Deputies shot and killed the 27-year-old parolee after he fired a shot from a 9 mm handgun into a deputy's chest. The deputy, Mike Frank, was wearing a protective vest. He and fellow deputies Greg Myers and Joe Dulworth returned fire.

The deputies were attempting to serve Sanchez with an arrest warrant.
