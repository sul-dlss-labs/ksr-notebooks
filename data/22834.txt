Press release from Louisa County, Commonwealth's Attorney Office

LOUISA, VA (WWBT) - Louisa County Commonwealth's Attorney Tom Garrett announced today that the shooting of Charles "Zeke" Sponaugle, Sr., by Louisa deputies on August 22, 2010 was justified.

The rural Central Virginia community of Louisa reached national headlines as the county mourned following a mass shooting committed by Sponaugle. Sponaugle shot six family members, killing two and firing at deputies before being killed during the exchange with law enforcement. A pitbull terrier was also killed after Sponagule ordered it to attack the deputies.

On speaking on his finding Garrett said "after reviewing the dash camera videos and other evidence I cannot imagine a scenario where an officer involved shooting could have been more justified. Make no mistake, the actions of these two deputies that day saved lives. I publicly commend them for their actions."
