Shaun McCoy, 22, was one of two young black men shot and killed in a confrontation with Torrance police officers at 2:38 p.m. Saturday, July 14, in the 2600 block of 231st Street. Also killed was Charlie Wilson, 20.

According to a news release issued by Torrance Police Lt. Rod Irvine, the incident began with a report of a possible burglary. Officers were called to the 2600 block of 231st Street, where a resident had reported seeing men go into a neighbor's house, then jump the fence to the backyard. There had been similar burglaries in the area recently, the release said.

When officers arrived, other neighbors repeated that the suspects were in the backyard and that a red Chevrolet Cavalier connected to the crime had just left. Officers stopped the Cavalier at Elm Avenue and 232nd Street and arrested the driver, Erin Jamahl Madden, 19, of Harbor City.

Other officers surrounded the block, where the remaining suspects were believed to be hiding. With the help of a Long Beach police helicopter, and dogs from the Torrance and Manhattan Beach police departments, they searched the area. They found the suspects in a storage shed.

The release offered no details of what happened next, saying only that "an officer-involved shooting occurred when they were confronted." Both men suffered gunshot wounds and died at the scene. Torrance police have not released the identities of the officers involved.
