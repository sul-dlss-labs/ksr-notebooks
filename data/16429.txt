SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - One person is dead and the other is in the hospital with severe injuries after a police chase ended in a fiery car crash in Shreveport.

Police say it all started with a report of an armed robbery of an individual around 11:15 p.m. Sunday in the 400 block of Seneca Trail.

When officers arrived on the scene, the victims reportedly told them a man with a gun walked up and took items from them. The suspect then reportedly got into a small white vehicle and fleeing the scene.

Later in the evening, the victim was reportedly in Bossier City when he spotted the vehicle involved in the armed robbery and flagged down an officer.

The officer gave chase, following the suspect's vehicle into Shreveport.

The chase ended just before midnight when the suspect's vehicle crashed into a railroad overpass on the exit ramp from I-49 southbound to Hollywood Ave. and Pierremont Rd. and caught fire.

Both the driver and passenger were taken to University Health, where the passenger was pronounced dead.

Shreveport police say the driver was 41-year-old Darien D. Pouncy and his passenger was 39-year-old Tyrell Odell.

Pouncy is charged with one count of armed robbery for his alleged involvement in the crime. However, police say Pouncy will soon face additional charges associated with the crash that claimed the life of Odell.

The incident remains under investigation.
