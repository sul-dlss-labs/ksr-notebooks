The officer had pulled Burrage over shortly before 5 p.m. in the 500 block of Jeffrey Avenue. After getting out of his vehicle, Burrage reached back into the car for a handgun, which he started to raise in the officer’s direction, according to police.

The officer fired one shot, which hit Burrage, who then ran off, police said.

The officer chased after Burrage, who fired several shots at the officer, and Burrage was able to get back into his vehicle and leave the scene as the officer took cover, according to police.

Burrage was later arrested at an Indiana hospital, and police said he was transferred to another hospital in critical condition.

Burrage was eventually charged with attempted murder, according to police.

The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force was contacted to conduct an investigation into the shooting, police said.
