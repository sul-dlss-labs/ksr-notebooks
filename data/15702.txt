OKLAHOMA CITY — One suspect was killed and an officer was transported to the hospital in an officer-involved shooting in southwest Oklahoma City Friday.

According to a statement by Oklahoma City Police, officers were attempting to make contact with a wanted felon, Herbert Hill, 26, who at the time was the only suspect wanted in an area robbery.

Officers found the suspect sitting in the passenger’s side of a car at the 1000 block of S.W. 62nd.

Reports say they tried to take him into custody, but he refused. Hill then flashed a firearm at the five officers and proceeded to shoot. That’s when the officers returned fire, killing the suspect.

The statement says 10 year veteran Sgt. John Townsend was hit once in the leg and another bullet grazed his back. He was rushed to OU Medical Center, and has since been released and is expected to make a full recovery.

Authorities say a female witness inside the car managed to exit the vehicle before the shooting.

The Oklahoma City Police Department homicide unit is investigating the case. All officers will be placed on administrative leave while the case is being investigated.
