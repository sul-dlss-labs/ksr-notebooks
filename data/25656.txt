AURORA, Colo. â€” An Aurora police officer fatally shot a man who allegedly confronted police with a machete Monday morning.

Officer Matthew Longshore, spokesman with the Aurora Police Department, said police responded to a possible hostage situation at 2210 S. Dallas Street at 8:44 a.m. Monday. An unknown male called 911 to report there were hostages inside an apartment and that somebody had been injured by a person with a machete.

When police arrived on scene, they knocked on the apartment door to alert the people or person inside that they were there. A woman answered the door and was escorted out of the residence for safety. Officers ordered anybody else in the apartment to come out, according to a press release from APD.

They were then confronted by a man with a machete, Longshore said. He was "actively threatening officers with a machete despite officer's commands to drop the machete," according to the press release.

One officer tried to use a Taser on the man as he threatened officers, APD said. When that didn't work, an officer shot the man. It was unclear how many shots were fired.

First responders administered first aid to the man. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.
