A police officer shot and killed a suspect in an armed robbery in the Bronx early Thursday as the suspect struggled over his loaded gun with another officer, the police said.

The deadly confrontation, in the Morris Heights neighborhood, followed a fast-paced pursuit that began with a robbery around 4 a.m. and ended with three shots inside the lobby of an apartment building at 1985 Davidson Avenue, said John J. McCarthy, the New York Police Department’s chief spokesman. It was the first time that the officer, a 26-year-old who joined the department in 2010, had fired his weapon while on patrol, Mr. McCarthy said.

Struck twice, the man, a 44-year-old Bronx resident, identified as James Torres, died a short time later at St. Barnabas Hospital. His weapon did not go off, Mr. McCarthy said.

“The suspect, his arm is being held by the officer and he’s struggling to pull his arm to the officer’s head with the loaded gun,” Mr. McCarthy said. “Shots are fired, only by the second officer.” The officer involved in the struggle did not draw his service weapon, Mr. McCarthy said.
