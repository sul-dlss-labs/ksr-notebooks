Eric Paul Bogart, a 49-year-old white man, died Thursday, Aug. 10, after he was shot by police in the 1600 block of Alta Mura Road in Pacific Palisades, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 10:53 p.m., officers from the LAPD’s Pacific Division responded to a call at a home and discovered that Bogart had been arguing with a woman who lived at the residence, and the two were in an on-again, off-again relationship, said Los Angeles Police Capt. Brian Wendling.

The man, later identified as Bogart, had fired several rounds at the woman, but she escaped unharmed. When officers arrived at the home they met with a private security guard who told them the suspect had barricaded himself inside.

Police then set up a perimeter around the house and called in a SWAT team, said Officer Drake Madison, an LAPD spokesman.

Crisis negotiators tried to speak to the suspect but he refused to leave the two-story Mediterranean style home, police told reporters at the scene.

During the standoff, SWAT officers fired tear gas into the house.

“We have deployed several rounds of tear gas because of the enormous size of the home, we’re talking about 9,000 square feet,” Madison said.

Bogart shot at officers shortly after 5 a.m. and officers returned fire, police said. No officers were injured.

A short time later, SWAT officers entered the home and found Bogart with a gunshot wound. The coroner has ruled the case a homicide.

Police recovered three handguns and a shotgun. The department identified the officers involved in the incident as Wilson Wong and Joseph Dominguez, according to a news release.
