In the wake of a high-speed police chase that left a young woman dead and the driver of the car she was riding in seriously injured, the southeast Georgia city of Metter has paid $500,000 to the young daughter of the deceased.

The city also agreed to change its policy regarding when police can conduct a chase. The fatal pursuit that killed Fenecia Holloway began when a Metter police officer following the minivan she was in ran a stop sign. The officer hit his blue lights, but the driver sped away.
