Efrain Lara Gutierrez, a 31-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Friday, Oct. 2, in the 18200 block of Renwick Road in unincorporated Los Angeles County, authorities said.

The shooting was reported about 1:15 a.m., said Deputy Aura Sierra.

Deputies were attempting to detain two suspected car thieves when they ran away, Sierra said. When they cornered one of the men, he pulled out a knife, she said.

“Fearing for his safety, one of the deputies fired several rounds from his weapon, hitting the suspect,” Sierra said.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene, Sierra said. No deputies were injured.

A knife was recovered at the scene, she said.

The second suspect remains at large, authorities said.
