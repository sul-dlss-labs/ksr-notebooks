A 25-year-old woman who was wielding a hatchet was fatally shot by police Friday at the Lake Hallie Wal-Mart, just outside of Eau Claire, authorities said.

The victim was identified as Melissa M. Abbott, originally from Black River Falls.

Chippewa County Sheriff Jim Kowalczyk told WEAU.com that the woman was a resident at the state-run Northern Wisconsin Center for the Developmentally Disabled.

The incident began late Friday afternoon when Lake Hallie Police were dispatched to the Wal-Mart to deal with a disorderly person.

"While officers were responding, additional information was provided that a female subject armed herself with a hatchet in the sporting goods department," Cal D. Smokowicz, Lake Hallie's police chief, said in a statement.

"The first officer on the scene shot the subject twice," he said. "She was struck once in the leg and once in the right upper abdomen."

Kowalczyk told the news media, "Commands were given to her to drop the weapon. She did not cooperate. She apparently then lunged toward the officer and the officer did what he's trained to do and he had shot her."

Kowalczyk said the escorts who were "responsible for" Abbott "were making sure that people were not affected and were advising people to step back as they tried to escort her out of the store."

Abbott was taken to a hospital and underwent surgery. She died at 11:58 p.m. Friday.

In expressing the police department's condolences, Smokowicz said, "Our department strives to resolve issues in the least intrusive means possible, however, every situation is unique and complex. Given the close proximity of other citizens and dangerous and threatening behavior of the subject the officer believed he had no other choice than to use deadly force."

The shooting will be investigated by the Chippewa County Sheriff's Office.
