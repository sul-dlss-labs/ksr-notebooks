Mark Miles, a 48-year-old white man, died Friday, Jan. 6, two days after he was shot by police in the 5200 block of Colfax Avenue in Valley Village, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers were searching for an assault suspect at an apartment Jan. 4 about 1:45 p.m. when they were informed by a resident to speak to Miles, who was inside a unit, according to an LAPD news release.

When officers entered the unit to speak to Miles, he revealed a steak knife and pointed it at the officers, authorities said.

According to police, officers drew their weapons and ordered Miles to drop his knife, but he refused. He then lunged at the officers, at which point an officer-involved shooting occurred.

Miles was taken to a hospital for medical treatment and died two days later. No officers were injured during the incident.

The LAPD Force Investigation Division is investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to contact the LAPD at (877) 527-3247. Tipsters who would like to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800) 222-8477.
