The male suspect, who was shot and killed by Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office deputies, has been identified by the Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office as 46 year-old Matthew Scott Wiese of Everett.

The cause of death has been determined to be multiple gunshot wounds from law enforcement.

Detectives with the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team (SMART)are continuing their investigation into the officer involved shooting incident in the 15200 block of Meadow Road in Lynnwood on June 19 and are working to establish an accurate timeline.

Deputies were initially investigating a court order violation between Matthew Wiese and his spouse. Wiese was not found at the location where the violation occurred but was contacted at the Meadow Road address by a deputy. When contacted, Wiese fired fireworks at the deputy who immediately requested assistance. As additional deputies arrived, Wiese also discharged fireworks at them as they took cover behind patrol cars.

Wiese then walked into an RV and reemerged pointing a firearm at deputies. He did not respond to or comply with repeated orders to drop the weapon. Deputies shot Wiese who was taken into custody and given medical aid. Wiese was transported to Harborview Medical Center where he died.

Based on standard procedures, three Snohomish County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) deputies have been placed on administrative leave. The deputies have been with SCSO for 14 years, 6 years and 5 years.
