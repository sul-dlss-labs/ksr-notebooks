Juan Carrizoza, a 22-year-old white man, was shot and killed by Bell Police officers Thursday, Feb. 4, in the 8100 block of Commercial Place in South Gate, authorities said.

Bell police were conducting a traffic stop on a white vehicle occupied by two males shortly after midnight when the suspects began firing at the officers, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department, which is investigating the incident.

The car drove off, and police pursued the car four miles into South Gate, where the vehicle crashed into a concrete wall at Seville Avenue and Santa Ana Street. The suspects exited the vehicle and one of the men began firing at Bell officers, police said.

One of the suspect's rounds struck the hood of a Bell police vehicle and officers returned fire, police said.

Carrizoza began running southbound on Commercial Place. A Bell police sergeant and another officer began shooting, and Carrizoza was struck several times in the upper torso.

County paramedics responded, and Carrizoza was pronounced dead at the scene. A weapon was recovered.

The other man escaped, officials said, and is at large. No officers were injured.
