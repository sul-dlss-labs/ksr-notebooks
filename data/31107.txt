An Anderson County Sheriff’s Office deputy shot a man after a police chase ended at the intersection of State 8 and Interstate 85 on Tuesday afternoon.

Sheriff Chad McBride said a deputy or deputies saw the man with a gun.

Jonathan Zachary Combs, 40, from Anderson, was shot as he got out of the car and presented a firearm, according to a statement from the Anderson County Coroner’s Office. He died at the scene.

McBride said body camera footage had been turned over to state investigators.

He said deputies tried to pull over what they believed to be a stolen red Camero near the city of Anderson around 1:50 p.m. and a chase continued on the interstate until the Camero left the freeway.

Just outside the freeway, deputies performed a maneuver with their vehicles to stop the car, McBride said.

McBride said Combs handled a gun and at least one deputy opened fire, McBride said.

Deputies attempted to render aid to Combs, the sheriff said.

Traffic was backed up and in some areas redirected as the bridge over the freeway was blocked by more than a dozen law enforcement and medical vehicles.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating.

It is the third such shooting for the Sheriff’s Office this year and the 31st such shooting statewide this year, according to SLED spokesman Tommy Crosby.
