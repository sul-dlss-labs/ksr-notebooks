A state police trooper fatally shot a man while responding to a call of one brother stabbing another, Pennsylvania State Police said.

Troopers were called to a domestic dispute between the two brothers in the first block of Staymen Drive, Menallen Township just before 5 p.m. Wednesday, police said.

Michael Drayer, 34, was attacking his brother Jesse Lynn Drayer, 40, with a large knife, police said. Though Michael Drayer had already stabbed his older brother, he continued to chase him on foot down Aspers Bendersville Road to the intersection with Carlisle Road.

Jesse Drayer flagged down a passing pickup truck and jumped into its bed in an attempt to hide from Michael Drayer, but troopers arrived on scene at that time, police said.

Jesse Drayer got into the police vehicle, seeking refuge from his brother, but the younger man followed him inside the cruiser, knife still in hand, police said.

Troopers ordered Michael Drayer to surrender, but the orders were ignored, police said. When Michael Drayer continued his attack, a trooper fired his weapon and hit Drayer.

Police said troopers immediately tried to help Drayer until EMS arrived, and he was transported to Gettysburg Hospital where he was pronounced dead by the Adams County Coroner.

Jesse Drayer is in stable condition at York Hospital, police said.

The trooper involved in the shooting was not identified by police, and is on administrative leave pending an internal investigation, police said.

The Troop H Major Case team is investigating the shooting and will provide their findings to the Adams County District Attorneyâ€™s Office, police said. The DA will determine if the shooting was justified.
