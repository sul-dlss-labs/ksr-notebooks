LARGO — The name of the woman who was fatally wounded after exchanging gunfire with Largo officers this week was released by police on Friday.

Deborah White, 49, is the woman who Largo police said was killed in a confrontation that started at about 11:15 a.m. Wednesday at the St. Pete Auto Auction at 14950 Roosevelt Blvd. Her family could not be located for comment on Friday.

She was pointing her gun at people at the business, according to police, when officers were sent to the scene. The woman was running west on Roosevelt Boulevard toward 49th Street, when police said officers encountered her at the intersection of Roosevelt Boulevard and Frontage Road.

They ordered her to put the gun down, police said, but she started firing. One round struck the windshield of a police vehicle.

Officers pursued her, and when she fired again, police said officers returned fire and fatally wounded her. She later died at Northside Hospital in St. Petersburg.

No other details about the shooting have been released. Largo police have not said what led to the shooting, what kind of weapon the woman had or how many shots she fired. The agency has not released the names of the officers who fired, or said how many shots they fired.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the officers’ actions under a new agreement the Largo Police Department struck with the state agency to look into all shootings involving the agency’s officers and the death of anyone who dies while in police custody.
