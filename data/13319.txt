SOUTHFIELD, Mich. â€” An off-duty Detroit police officer shot and killed a 17-year-old early Monday during an attempted carjacking here, according to investigators.

The shooting happened as the officer was getting out of his Dodge Charger at 2 a.m. in the parking lot of Sutton Place Apartments about 15 miles northwest of Detroit, Southfield Police Lt. Nick Loussia said in a release.

Two teens armed with handguns approached the officer, who pulled out his own handgun. He shot one of the alleged carjackers, killing the 17-year-old, the release said. The second teen, a 16-year-old, dropped his handgun and ran.

Southfield Police officers caught the 16-year-old, who is in custody. Both handguns that the suspects used were recovered, and the investigation is continuing.

Detroit's police chief is expected to talk later Monday about efforts to prevent carjackings in his city, which include 53 unmarked Dodge Chargers that are being prepped for deployment and a task force formed in collaboration with Michigan State Police.

Chief James Craig has said that carjackings in Detroit are down about a third year to date, but he doesn't consider it enough. The FBI, in its 2012 preliminary Uniform Crime Report showed an increase of 2.4% in all motor-vehicle thefts in Detroit, almost 11,500 stolen. The crime report does not specifically list carjackings, and the report for the first six months of 2013 was not available yet.

Earlier this month, mayoral candidate Mike Dugeon, a barber whose campaign was criticized as an attempt to confuse people who wished to write in former Wayne County Prosecutor Mike Duggan, had his 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix carjacked while he had his driver's side door open looking for his cellphone.
