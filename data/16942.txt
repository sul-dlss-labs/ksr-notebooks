Lori Valenti, 49, was bludgeoned to death in her home by her boyfriend Kevin Close, police said.

A Seagoville police officer fatally shot Close after he "charged aggressively at" responding officers with a baseball bat and a fireplace poker, police said.

Valenti's estranged husband, Terry Valenti, said he and his wife had very recently reconciled after separating in October.

But Lori Valenti's family from Connecticut said she used her maiden name, Brocuglio, and said the relationship was over.

She said her mother was a good woman who had made mistakes. "My mom cared about everyone she came in contact with."

Lori Valenti's brother, Kelly Brocuglio, said he did not know much about Close, who he called a monster.

"I wish I could kill him ten more times," Brocuglio said. "She was a real good girl. She had a good heart. We're going to miss her like crazy."

Public records show Close had a criminal history in Dallas County. He was convicted of forgery, and took a plea deal for marijuana possession and the manufacture or delivery of methamphetamine in a drug free zone.

Three police officers were dispatched to the 600 block of Fran Street about 5 a.m. Saturday after a man called and said he had killed his girlfriend, Seagoville police Chief Ray Calverley said.

Police knocked on the door, but he didn’t immediately come outside so they backed away “in case it turned out to be a shooting or something to that effect,” Calverley said.

Minutes later, Close walked out of the house holding a baseball bat and a fireplace poker, then “came at the officers” and one of them opened fire, killing him.

Police found Lori Valenti’s body inside.

Lori Valenti had four children from a previous marriage, two daughters and two sons.

Terry Valenti said his 19-year-old stepson lived with Lori Valenti, but was not at home at the time of the murder.

Police released the house to its owner Saturday afternoon. Blood and a scrap of crime scene tape remained on the driveway.

Terry and Lori Valenti, two East Coast natives, moved to Texas in 2011.

After a brief move back to New York in 2012, the two settled in Texas again later that year, he said.

The officer who shot Close has been placed on routine administrative leave. He was identified only as a 26-year veteran of the department.

The Texas Rangers are helping with the investigation.
