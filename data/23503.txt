Police in Mulberry killed a man they were seeking to question about shoplifting smokeless tobacco from a gas station convenience store Tuesday morning. Officers said he pulled a weapon.

Crawford County Sheriff Ron Brown said police were called after a man ran off with smokeless tobacco from a Sunoco on Highway 64. At apartments nearby, according to Brown, an officer said the man refused to comply with orders when he was called out. The man reportedly pulled a weapon, apparently a knife, and the officer then shot him.

Brown identified the dead man as Tom Heath, 56. His family told 40/29 he was a veteran who suffered from PTSD, was schizophrenic and was irregular in taking prescribed medication. A neighbor said she’d had run-ins with Heath. A family member said he’d had no previous problems with law enforcement.

The officer, who wasn’t identified, was placed on leave while the shooting is being investigated by the sheriff’s office. The State Police was not asked to review the case, as it often is in police shootings.
