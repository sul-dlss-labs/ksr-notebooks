Police have identified a man who died in police custody after a foot chase in northeast Springfield Monday afternoon.

Wally A. McCurdy, 32, of Springfield, Mo., died at the hospital. The Greene County Medical Examiner will determine a cause of death.

An officer working in an off-duty capacity for Walmart off of Kearney Street was told two shoplifting suspects, McCurdy and a woman, left the store and ran to the nearby Culver's restaurant. The off-duty officer requested back-up and responded to Culver's. The officer arrested a woman at the restaurant.

Backup officers then pursued McCurdy as he left the restaurant. One officer in the pursuit used his TASER. The officers then caught up with McCurdy at Glenstone and Kearney. Officers then noticed he struggled to breathe. Officers conducted life-saving measures, but McCurdy later died at Mercy Hospital.

Police say the two officers are on administrative leave as a both internal and criminal investigation happens, This is routine.

SPD standard operating guidelines say that if a suspect shows defensive resistance, as in this case, less lethal weapons like a TASER can be used. SPD defines defensive resistance as when a suspect attempts to push or pull away in a manner that does not allow the officer to establish control, but never attempts to strike the officer.

Those guidelines also say that officers should have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity to start a foot pursuit.

An autopsy will be conducted by the Greene County Medical Examinerâ€™s Office to determine the cause of death.

Detectives continue to investigate and ask anyone who has information about this incident to contact the Springfield Police Department at (417) 864-1810 or make an anonymous call to Crime Stoppers at (417) 869-TIPS (8477).
