Auburn, N.Y. -- Auburn police today identified the two officers who were involved in the killing of an estranged husband who had broken into his wife's home and attacked with a meat cleaver, Auburn police said Wednesday.

Donald Laraway, an officer for more than 10 years, fired the four shots that killed 45-year-old Jeffrey M. Harris Saturday, police said.

Jared Georgi, an officer for more than 14 years, also responded to a call from Harris' wife, Teresa M. Harris.

Auburn Police Chief Brian Neagle gave the following account:

Teresa Harris was in her home at 11 Barber St., apartment 1, when she called Cayuga County 911 just before 11:30 p.m. Saturday to say Harris was trying to force his way into her apartment, in violation of an order of protection.

The two officers responded, learning en route that Harris was banging on doors and was known to carry a knife.

When officers arrived, Harris was trying to break through a second door in the basement using a meat cleaver.

As Harris continued to smash through the door, one officer tried to stop him with a Taser, but it was ineffective because Harris was wearing a thick jacket, police said.

Laraway and Georgi identified themselves several times as police officers, and Harris told them he had a gun, police said.

When Harris raised the meat cleaver over his head and advanced toward the officers, police said, Laraway shot him four times.

Harris was later pronounced dead. Police determined he did not have a gun.

The Auburn Police Department said Tuesday that it had nearly finished its investigation and would be turning the case over to Cayuga County District Attorney Jon Budelmann for review.
