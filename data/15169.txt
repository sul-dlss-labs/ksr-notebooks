Those officers were identified Thursday afternoon as Sgt. Eric Culver, Sgt. Paul Humphrey, Officer Brad Harris and Detective Michael Simpson.Police said when they went into the home on Wednesday, it was clear from the beginning the woman inside did not want to go to jail.LMPD investigators continued to collect evidence at the home of 39-year-old Wade on Roaming Plains Court on Thursday morning.Wade was taken to University Hospital, where she died soon after."Here at LMPD, we want to send out our condolences to the family and all involved parties from last night," said Louisville Metro Police Col. Ozzy Gibson.Last week, a warrant was issued for Wade's arrest on two felony probation violations.She was convicted of fraud, identity theft and forgery.On Wednesday afternoon, police and the U.S. Marshal's Service attempted to serve the arrest warrant."The task force engaged a female subject inside the home and she indicated she had a weapon and a small child," Gibson said.Authorities then backed off, set up a perimeter and called in a SWAT team."My girlfriend came back and she said the whole subdivision was blocked off and that one of the officers told her there was a woman with a gun," said neighbor Jerry Guzman.Guzman lives across the street and saw the situation unfold outside his front window."Oh, I was terrified for my daughter. I have a 9-month-old, so yeah, it was a scary feeling," Guzman said.Eight hours passed and then, just before 11 p.m., authorities made their way into the home.Police said Wade pointed a gun at them and that's when officers opened fire."And then I hear like da da da da da, like shooting," Guzman said. "It was hard to say how many exactly, but there was quite a lot. I would say right around the range of 6 and 8, maybe."Wade's 18-month-old son was present, but not hurt during the incident.He's currently being cared for by family members.It's unclear if Wade fired any shots at the officers, but police said they recovered a gun from her.While WLKY was in the neighborhood Thursday morning, Wade's husband returned to the home and politely asked that the media respect his privacy at this time.He had no comment.
