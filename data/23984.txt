A police officer shot and killed a man who was holding a knife inside a business in Surprise late Wednesday morning, officials said.

Sgt. Tim Klarkowski, a Surprise police spokesman, said officers had initially been called at 11:39 a.m. about a welfare check at the business at Bell and El Mirage roads.

Details about what led to the shooting were not immediately available.

Klarkowski said the suspect, a man in his 50s, died at the scene.

Diana Greene, owner of Molly and Friend's pet grooming, said that she had just moved her business into the complex. She described hearing a loud bang before noon.

"We had seen two police officers run up to the open office back there, it's a rental office, and (we) heard a gunshot," she said.

"Immediately the police came walking back down and then they went back up with two stretchers and came back down with two empty stretchers, and then the coroner's van pulled in," Greene said.

It was the second time Wednesday that a police officer in the Valley had shot someone. Phoenix police shot and injured a man suspected of arson earlier in the day.

Law-enforcement officers in Maricopa County have shot 21 people, killing 12 of them, so far in 2018.
