TAFT, Texas â€” One person died after a standoff with law enforcement and another person was shot during a Sunday night incident in Taft.

The man who was shot died apparently of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. And another woman who earlier was being held by the suspect was wounded.

The case currently is under investigation by the Texas Rangers. What started as a burglary call at the Terrace Apartments escalated, leading for San Patricio County Sheriff's Department and Taft police to be sent to the scene.

San Patricio Sheriff Oscar Rivera posted on Facebook how the events unfolded.

Rivera said when police arrived, they saw a man holding a gun in his hand and pointing it at officers. Officers fired at the suspect and during that exchange, officials say one of the victims from the apartment was shot.

Deputies helped get her away from the scene and into an ambulance.

Sheriff's officials say the man then barricaded himself in his apartment. After a few hours, officers were able to obtain a search warrant and then went inside the apartment.

Once they entered, they learned the suspect was dead, apparently shooting himself.

Some people who live in the apartment complex told KRIS 6 they were forced out of their units because of the shooting and the standoff that ensued.

One man said he stood outside for 4 hours waiting for the standoff to conclude.

The woman who was mistakenly shot posted a message on Facebook saying she is glad she is alive. She also thanked friends and family members for their support.

The suspect has not yet been identified.
