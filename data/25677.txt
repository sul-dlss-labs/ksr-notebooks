Miami Gardens police are investigating a crash involving a stolen vehicle that killed two innocent people and sent two others to the hospital in critical condition.

The incident happened Sunday night, after police received a report of a stolen rental car. When officers arrived in Miami Gardens they discovered the victimâ€™s cell phone was still inside the car and police tracked the cell phone and drove to its location.

Once police arrived, they say the car took off at a high rate of speed. Inside the car was and adult and a 16 year old.

Surveillance video shows the driver of the stolen car blew through a stop sign at Northwest 39th Avenue and Northwest 175th Street and T-boned another car with two people inside. The two people in the car died. The two people inside the stolen car were airlifted to the hospital in critical condition.

The family identified the two victims as Malcolm Lightbourn and Tarvis Gant.

Police haven't released the identities of any of the people involved.

"Your stomach feels like its in knots," said Terria Jones, the victim's daughter. "I literally felt my heart break because my brother called and said they don't know anything. All they knew was my dad was involved in an accident."

Two neighbors claimed the officer was chasing the vehicle at the time of the crash. Miami Gardens police said they were not chasing at the time.

The incident remains under investigation.

"We do want answers," said Jones. "We don't want this to happen to another family. We want this to be treated as if it were a Miami Gardens Police family, you know?"
