CANTON TOWNSHIP -- An off-duty Detroit police officer fatally shot his wife, who was also a Detroit police officer, in the parking lot of a suburban

library

on Tuesday before killing himself, authorities said.

Patricia Catherine Williams, 33, was pronounced dead upon arrival at an area hospital, while Edward Gordon Williams II, 36, died later Tuesday after he was taken off life support, said Sgt. Mark Gajeski of the Canton Township police.

"The male shot the female and then turned the gun on himself," Gajeski said.

John Roach, spokesman for the Detroit Police Department, had no immediate comment. Autopsies are pending and the case remains under investigation, Canton Township police said.

Police said a woman they now identify as Patricia Williams had gone to the Canton Township police station early Saturday and told authorities she was assaulted, but declined to file a formal complaint or provide her or husband's name.

A day later, officers responded to the couple's home in Canton, which is on the western edge of Wayne County about 20 miles from Detroit, after a call about a "possible domestic situation" â€” but no one was home, police said.

Patricia Williams was going to the police station, which is near the

library

, when she was shot around 9:15 a.m. EDT Tuesday, Gajeski said. Witnesses said she and Edward Williams were sitting and talking near the Canton Public

Library

beforehand.

A woman who called 911 described the scene.

"I've got a man who shot himself and a woman in the parking lot of the Canton

library

. ... He shot himself and he shot her," the woman said on a recording released by Canton Township police.

The

library

was open at the time but closed after the

shooting

. It will reopen Wednesday.
