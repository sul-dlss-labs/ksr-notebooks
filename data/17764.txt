MARQUETTE COUNTY, MI - No criminal charges will be filed against a Marquette County sheriff's deputy who killed a suicidal Ishpeming Township man last week, the Associated Press reported.

Deputy Keith Romback's decision to use force against the man, Clifford Leroy Tucker, 68, was justified as Romback believed he was in danger of being seriously injured or killed.

At about 9 a.m. on June 9, Romback responded to Tucker's home after reports of him being suicidal. Upon arrival, Tucker allegedly approached Romback while carrying a shotgun.

Romback asked Tucker multiple times to lower his weapon. According to his body cameras, Tucker reportedly pleaded, "just shoot me." Romback shot his service weapon at Tucker four times and and called for an ambulance.

Tucker reportedly called the hospital earlier that day to say he was in pain and planned to take his own life.

After further review of the case, evidence supported that Romback was in danger. He was the only officer at the scene.
