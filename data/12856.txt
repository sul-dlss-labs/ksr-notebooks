A suspect thrown from his car during a crash at the end of a police chase has died at a Bend hospital.

KTVZ-TV reports that 24-year-old Benjamin Robert Watson of Bend died late Thursday, eight days after the crash.

Investigators say Watson had drugs in his system during the pursuit. He also possessed a stolen handgun and was talking on a cellphone.

Police Lt. Chris Carney says police tried to stop Watson's car because they believed he was involved in drug activity.

The chase lasted five miles, with the vehicles reaching speeds of at least 65 mph in light traffic. It ended when Watson's car overturned, ejecting him.
