Gerard McCarty saw it all.

“I was near Boulevard, turning on to the onramp and the perpetrator came around this corner, ran into her, went up the onramp with officers in pursuit, and right when they got onto 84 you hear gunfire break out,” he said, adding drivers were stuck on the onramp when he heard 15 shots.

“People were turning around though, panicking, there was that much gunfire,” he said. “People were scared and coming back down.”

The scene caused a backup at least five miles long on eastbound 84. Traffic was diverted until it reopened around 9:30 p.m.

It’s still unclear what happened in the moments before the shooting on 84 shoulder or if the car was stopped.

The CHP and DA’s office is investigating.
