MIDDLETOWN >> Police have identified the man shot and killed by Middletown police on Tuesday as Lennord Whittle, 25, of Middletown.

Investigation of the shooting is continuing by state police and the Orange County District Attorney’s Office.

Whittle was shot and killed by police officers who responded to a report of a foot chase between two men. Whittle was chasing another man while carrying a knife when police shot and killed him near Sam’s Mart Convenience Store, authorities said.

Middletown Police Chief Ramon Bethencourt said the officers involved were a man and woman, but he declined to say if one or both fired their weapons. They were not identified by name. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave.

The case is expected to be presented to a grand jury to determine if the shooting was justified.
