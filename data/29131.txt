The two Wabash officers who shot a man earlier this month after he fatally stabbed his 10-year-old son were justified in the shooting and will not face charges, Wabash County Prosecutor William Hartley Jr. said Monday.

Wabash police officers Nick Brubaker and Daniel Henderson returned fire on William Sendelbach, 32, "in defense of their lives" after the man fired on officers responding to a report of a family disturbance on Oct. 8, according to a news release.

Officers were dispatched to the family's home at 294 E. Maple St. after William Sendelbach "allegedly shot at an occupied garbage truck that was making morning rounds," police said.

The driver of the truck was not injured.

Sendelbach reportedly fired shotgun rounds at arriving officers, striking Brubaker in the leg. Officers returned fire, and Sendelbach "was struck by multiple bullets," police said.

Police later learned Sendelbach stabbed his son, Kayden, who died two days after the incident.

Sendelbach died Saturday at a Fort Wayne hospital. He had been charged with the murder of his son and faced two counts of attempted murder. He was also charged for firing at the garbage truck and for shooting Brubaker in the right leg.

Brubaker recovered from his injury and returned to duty, according to the news release.
