The motorcyclist killed after he disregarded a red light while fleeing from law enforcement Friday night has been identified as Aaron David Skinner, 20, of Humble.

According to the findings of DPS Trooper Eric Lopez, Skinner was traveling east on Kingwood Drive at a high rate of speed and disregarded the red traffic signal when he reached the intersection of Trailwood Village. The second vehicle was northbound on Trailwood and, with a green light, proceeded across the intersection and struck Skinner’s motorcycle.

Original post:

At 12:37 a.m. a Montgomery County Precinct 4 Deputy encountered a Suzuki motorcycle traveling at high speed on the US 59 feeder at FM 1314. When the deputy attempted to stop the motorcycle , the motorcycle fled south to Kingwood Drive then east running traffic lights and still at a high rate of speed. When they reached the intersection of Trailwood Village the motorcycle failed to yield the right of way to a SUV which was crossing Kingwood Drive under a green light. The motorcycle struck the SUV just behind the drivers door knocking the driver of the SUV unconscious. The motorcycle driver who was in his early 20’s was ejected partially into the SUV and then to the ground. He was pronounced dead on the scene when Houston Paramedics arrived on the scene.

The driver of the SUV was transported to the hospital in stable condition.

The pursuit lasted less than five minutes.

The crash was investigated by DPS. The body was transported to the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office for autopsy.

Kingwood Drive reopened at 430am.
