WEST VALLEY CITY — A West Valley City man is dead after an hours-long standoff with police early Monday.

Police responded to a domestic violence report early Monday at a home near 7100 West and 3000 South in West Valley City of alleged abuse on a juvenile by an adult family member. Police briefly questioned the man before he barricaded himself inside the home, according to Lt. Steve Burke of West Valley City Police Department.

Police were able to maintain intermittent contact with the man via phone and SWAT team members were called to help respond to the incident. Two gunshots were heard before police were able to obtain a search warrant, and upon entry of the home the suspect was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound about 2:16 p.m., Burke said.

The identity of the man has not been released to protect the identity of the juvenile.
