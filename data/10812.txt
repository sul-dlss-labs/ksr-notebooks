A College of Staten Island employee who was smoking pot on campus died of a heart attack Tuesday after wrestling with a cop trying to arrest him, police said.

The suspect — identified by sources as Cory Holmes, 39, an off-duty member of the school's auxiliary service — was smoking marijuana in a bathroom when an NYPD officer caught a whiff and confronted him, police said.

Holmes darted out of the rest room and the cop chased him to a nearby parking lot, where a struggle ensued, police said.

As the two wrestled, Holmes tried to swipe a gun from the officer's holster, a police source said. During the struggle, the pistol's slide pulled back and a live bullet popped out of the chamber, the source said.

Two civilians joined in the fracas and helped to subdue the wild Holmes, sources said. After Holmes was handcuffed, he suddenly went into cardiac arrest and was taken to Richmond University Medical Center, where he died, police said.

Cops said the gun involved in the struggle never discharged. The officer was taken to Staten Island University Hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries.

"This is a very serious event that occurred on our campus," said the college's president, Ira Persky. "We are sorry it happened. A member of our family is dead, and it's unfortunate."
