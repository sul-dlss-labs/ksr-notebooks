A South Carolina judge imposed a stiff sentence on a Salley man Friday after he pleaded guilty to charges related to a car wreck on Hollow Creek Road that led to the death of a 16-year-old girl in January 2017.

Willie Seawright Jr., 22, of Honeysuckle Trail, pleaded guilty Thursday to the charges of failure to stop for blue lights resulting in death and possession of a stolen vehicle valued $2,000 or less, court records show.

Ny'Zarria Kitchings, 16, of Salley, was a passenger in the car with Seawright. She was killed in the crash.

The judge sentenced Seawright to the maximum sentence of 25 years on the failure to stop for blue lights resulting in death charge and 30 days on the possession of stolen vehicle charge. Both charges will run concurrently.

Seawright was originally charged with reckless homicide, two counts of attempted murder, armed robbery with a deadly weapon, two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, unlawful carrying of a pistol, possession of a stolen vehicle, failure to stop for blue lights and driving under suspension, according to jail records.

The other state court charges were dismissed by way of the guilty plea, solicitors said.

Second Judicial Circuit Solicitor Sam Grimes prosecuted the case.
