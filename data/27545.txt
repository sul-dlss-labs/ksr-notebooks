MARTINSBURG, W.Va. — A man was killed and a second person suffered serious injuries in a Friday morning crash on Interstate 81 in Berkeley County.

Berkeley County Sheriff Curtis Keller said a chase began on Route 9 near Martinsburg. A deputy saw a vehicle speeding off of I-81 onto Route 9 west. The deputy tried to stop the vehicle in the parking lot of Lust Gentleman’s Club.

After the deputy turned on his cruiser’s lights, the driver took off and got onto I-81 southbound. He later got off another exit and re-entered the northbound lanes toward Maryland.

At around 1 a.m., the driver crashed into the back of a tractor trailer just south of the Potomac River bridge. The tractor trailer’s driver was not injured.

The driver, identified by Sheriff Keller as Euclides Agramonte, 24, was pronounced dead on scene. A 20-year-old man, a passenger in the vehicle, was taken to Berkeley Medical Center before being airlifted to another hospital.

The crash closed the northbound lanes until around 5 o’clock Friday morning.
