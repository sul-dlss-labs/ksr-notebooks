The Kansas Highway Patrol has identified the person who was killed when a brief police chase ended in a collision.

Troopers say Dennis E. Affolter, 69, of Topeka was killed Thursday when a car fleeing from troopers hit his Ford Explorer in the intersection of SW McAlister and Holly Lane.

Around 12:15 p.m. Thursday, a trooper spotted a black Acura driven by Brandon K. Jordan, 48, of Topeka, that matched the description of a vehicle involved in a forgery case reported to Topeka Police.

The trooper followed Jordan south on Gage Blvd. and, when he turned west onto Holly Lane, tried to pull him over. Instead of stopping, KHP says Jordan suddenly sped up, ran the stop sign at McAlister - two blocks away - and collided with Affolter's Explorer, which was driving south on McAlister.

Affolter later died of his injuries.

KHP says Jordan remains hospitalized. When he's released, they will book him into the Shawnee Co. Jail on charges of 1st Degree Murder in the commission of a Felony, Felony Flee and Elude Resulting in an Injury Accident, Identity Theft, Felony Obstruction, Drive While License is Suspended, Speeding, Failing to Stop at a Stop Sign and No Seatbelt.

KHP says Jordan had a passenger in his car, identified as Shelley L. Cunningham, 45, of Topeka. She also remains hospitalized, but will be charged with Identity Theft Crimes, Obstruction and No Seatbelt.
