Huntsville’s first homicide victim of 2020 has been identified by the authorities as 42-year-old Rene Moore.

Madison County Coroner Tyler Berryhill said an autopsy determined Moore’s death was a homicide caused by fatal gunshot wounds.

The man accused of killing Moore also took his own life, according to Huntsville police. Cornett Demetric Evans, 46, was found at a Motel 8 Inn on the 500 block of First Avenue North in Birmingham early this morning. As the authorities tried making verbal contact with Evans, they heard a gunshot inside his hotel room, said Huntsville police Lt. Michael Johnson. Evans was declared dead at the scene at 1:21 a.m.

Evans was wanted on a warrant charging him with murder, according to Huntsville police. He was accused of shooting Moore on Thursday morning in the parking lot of Sunlake at Edgewater Apartments off Zierdt Road.

After the deadly shooting, police searched for Evans, who was reportedly suicidal and possibly traveling to a veteran’s affair clinic. After police got information that Evans might be in Birmingham, VA locations in that city were on lockdown as a precaution.

VA locations in Birmingham and Huntsville will be open for normal business hours today.

“The safety of our Veteran patients, guests and staff is our number one priority,” said Stacy Vasquez, director of the Birmingham VA Health Care System, in a statement. “The steps taken were to ensure we protect those in our care.”
