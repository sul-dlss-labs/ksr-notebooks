IRVINE – Police have identified a man found dead of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound after a three-hour police standoff Thursday night at an Irvine apartment complex.

SWAT team members discovered the body of Patrick Sanchez, 44, several hours after two Sheriff’s deputies served an eviction notice to the apartment in the 400 block of Hayes heard a single gunshot from the residence.

The deputies called in reinforcements, with police closing off several blocks around the home and evacuating 25 nearby apartment units. Seven nearby schools were also placed on lockdown.

After attempts to reach Sanchez by phone or loudspeaker were unsuccessful, police threw tear gas canisters into the apartment. SWAT team members finally entered the apartment just after 4:20 p.m.

Sanchez’s death surprised his neighbors, who described him as reserved, but not unfriendly.

Authorities revealed today that Thursday’s standoff wasn’t the first time police were called to Sanchez’s apartment this week.

On Wednesday evening, Sanchez’s sister reported that she was unable to reach him by phone, and was worried about his frame of mind, Irvine police Lt. Henry Boggs said.

Deputies met Sanchez’s sister at his apartment complex, but did not contact Sanchez himself, since the sister had finally reached him, Boggs said.

Police say Sanchez appears to have died from a self inflicted gunshot, with detectives recovering a gun at the scene. The coroner’s investigation, which is still ongoing, will determine the exact cause of death, Boggs said.
