Authorities say a suspect shot by a police officer Tuesday morning has died.

Tempe police received a report of a man with a knife walking in the middle of a street near Rural Road and Southern Avenue just before 7 a.m.

While responding, police learned the suspect had crashed his vehicle into a parked vehicle and had set the knife down.

The first officer on scene tried to contact the suspect, and the two began to struggle, according to a news release from the Tempe Police Department.

During the fight, police say the suspect pulled out a knife and began to stab the officer. A second officer arrived and observed the assault taking place.

That officer jumped out of his vehicle and drew his service weapon, firing multiple shots at the suspect.

Both the first officer and suspect were taken to the hospital. The suspect was later pronounced deceased at the hospital. The officer is in stable condition but is continuing to receive treatment.

Police did not identify those involved, though officials said the injured officer has 19 years of service with the department and the officer who killed the suspect has 18 years with the department.

That officer, while drawing his weapon and shooting at the suspect, tried to turn on his body camera. However, authorities said he was not successful in doing so.
