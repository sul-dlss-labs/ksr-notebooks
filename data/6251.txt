Two Chicago police officers who fatally shot a man after he allegedly charged at them with a meat cleaver and a lead pipe acted appropriately, police said Friday. The man's girlfriend said he was suicidal and wanted police to shoot him.

A departmental review of the shooting Thursday of Clinton Morgan, 28, found that the officers properly used deadly force, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

Police said two female officers responded to a call of a man threatening to light himself on fire in the 4500 block of South Wood Street. The officers told Morgan to drop the cleaver and pipe, but he came after the officers, Camden said. The officers called a supervisor for a Taser to subdue him, Camden said, but in the meantime Morgan continued to advance, so the officers used a chemical spray in an attempt to disable him. When the spray had no effect, and Morgan continued to advance, the officers shot him, Camden said.
