A Box Elder police officer who shot and killed a man May 2 was justified in using lethal force, according to the official shooting report released Wednesday.

Jason Wayne Traversie, 44 of Box Elder, was killed by Officer John Cargill during a domestic violence incident at the Valley Village Mobile Home Park on North Ellsworth Road. The state Division of Criminal Investigation

states that Cargill fired three shots at Traversie, hitting him twice.

Cargill and two other officers were at the mobile home park because of a disturbance between Traversie and a woman who told police that she had been assaulted. She told officers that earlier in the day, Traversie head-butted her, grabbed her and hit her. She added that she was afraid Traversie would kill her if she stayed in the home.

Cargill told investigators that as he talked with Traversie on the deck of the mobile home; Traversie grabbed a large wooden club or handle (investigators later determined it was an ax handle). At that time, Traversie also allowed two dogs to “aggressively charge the officers.” Cargill fired one shot at a dog as he backed up, but missed.

Cargill said Traversie continued to come toward him as he raised the ax handle over his head and ignored commands. That’s when Cargill shot him.

The autopsy on Traversie showed that he had THC in his system and his blood alcohol content was .132.

Traversie also had a history of violent crime, including convictions for attempted aggravated assault, simple assault-domestic, simple assault and resisting arrest.
