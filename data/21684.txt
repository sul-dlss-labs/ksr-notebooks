The family of a young man fatally shot by an off-duty police officer outside a Burger King restaurant on Christmas morning is demanding that a civilian review board be appointed to investigate. Brian Fillmore's mother, sister and niece gathered Tuesday with two dozen supporters from the New Black Panther Party and other groups outside the fast-food restaurant on Lyons Avenue where Fillmore, 20, of Newark, died of a single gunshot wound at about 2 a.m. Saturday. "This was a young man just waiting for a Big Mac and fries or something when he got shot by a renegade cop," said Zayid Muhammad, a spokesman for the New Black Panther Party's Greater New York-New Jersey Chapter. "This was a good man in commission of no crime, posing no threat to anyone," Muhammad said. "This happened because someone was trying to play cowboys and Indians on Christmas night." Police said the officer fired one shot because he feared for his life after the man drove toward him and ran over his right foot. Carolyn Wright, an assistant Essex County prosecutor, said that, as in any fatal shooting involving police, the case would be presented to a grand jury to determine whether the officer acted properly. "The matter is under investigation," said Wright, who declined to identify the officer. "Beyond that, I won't comment on any of the specifics of how this incident occurred." A Burger King official said the off-duty officer had been working as a security guard at the restaurant. An ordinance creating a civilian police review board was approved by the Irvington City Council about three years ago. [ more ] and [more]
