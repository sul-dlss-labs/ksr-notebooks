ASHVILLE, Fla. (WCTV) -- We're learning new details about a crash in Jefferson County that took the life of a 15-year-old boy.

According to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, around 2:05 a.m. Thursday, a JCSO investigator noticed a white SUV stop abruptly in the northbound lanes of S. Jefferson Street in Monticello. When the investigator pulled up beside the vehicle, he saw that the passenger’s face was covered. As he attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle, the SUV sped away and a vehicle pursuit was initiated. JCSO and Monticello Police units were called for backup.

The pursuit continued down Ashville Highway, with the SUV then turning onto U.S. Hwy 221 and heading towards Greenville.

Around 2:30 a.m., units in pursuit reported seeing a “flash” inside of the SUV and the vehicle almost immediately ran off of the roadway.

The Florida Highway Patrol reports that the vehicle then struck several trees at US 221 near Bippus Street, south of Ashville.

Troopers say the vehicle overturned and caught fire.

The 15-year-old passenger from Greenville was killed in the crash. The 17-year-old driver was taken to Shands UF in Gainesville in critical condition.

Deputies on scene determined that the SUV had been stolen from Madison County earlier in the night.

Deputies also learned that the subjects in the vehicle may have been involved in an armed robbery at a Greenville convenience store that occurred around 1:48 a.m.

The Madison County Sheriff's Office issued a statement that the "events that occurred in Jefferson County a short time [after the robbery] are being investigated as possibly being related to the robbery."

In that incident, deputies say two males entered a Fast Track store in Greenville and demanded money, before fleeing north on US 221 with an undisclosed amount of cash.
