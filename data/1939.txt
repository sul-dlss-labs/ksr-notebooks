A 22-year-old Brooklyn man who went on a rampage in the house he shared with his mother in Canarsie was shot and killed by a responding police detective early yesterday after he threatened the detective with a knife, the police said. The man's family disputed the police account, saying that he was not armed when he was shot.

The man, Jamil Moore, of 108-06 Avenue N, was the second man to be shot and killed by the police in Brooklyn over the Labor Day weekend. At 7:30 p.m. on Saturday night, Paul Angel, 55, menaced a shopkeeper and several young women on a Bensonhurst street with a knife and then approached a police car and stabbed a police officer through the window of the car before the officer shot and killed him, the police said.

Many details of the Canarsie shooting were unclear last night.

It began when the police received a 911 call reporting an assault in progress by a man with a knife at the two-family house on Avenue N that Mr. Moore shared with his mother. His mother, Jennifer Moore, a bus driver, said in an interview that Mr. Moore had ''flipped out'' when he found that his telephone was not working.

''He took it out by breaking up things in the house, appliances,'' she said.

Sgt. Kevin Hayes, a police spokesman, said that when the police arrived in the house around 6 a.m., they were confronted by Mr. Moore, who was armed with a knife. Sergeant Hayes said that the police ordered him to drop the knife but he refused, advancing toward them with the knife in his hand. A detective, whom the police did not identify, fired two shots at Mr. Moore, striking him in the torso. Mr. Moore was taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 11:42 a.m., the police said.
