Lawrence police are investigating after a crash Monday afternoon involving a squad car killed an elderly Indianapolis couple.

Norman Elling, 86 and his wife, Selma Elling, 87, both of Indianapolis were killed in the accident, which happened around 2 p.m. Monday near the intersection of Pendleton Pike and North Mitthoeffer Road.

Deputy Chief Gary Woodruff of the Lawrence Police Department said that the officer, 15-year-veteran Johnathan Clark, was heading east on Pendleton Pike to a reported shoplifting in progress.

As the officer reached the intersection, a sedan was in the process of making a left turn from westbound Pendleton Pike onto southbound Mitthoeffer. The two vehicles then crashed in the intersection, leaving the police vehicle with front-end damage, and the sedan with damage to the passenger side.

The officer did not have his lights or sirens on at the time of the accident, Woodruff said.

Woodruff said the officer suffered a minor injury. The officer's K-9 companion was checked by medics but did not suffer visible injuries.

There is no indication that alcohol or drugs played a role in the crash, Woodruff said. The officer will undergo blood testing, per Indiana law.

The investigation into the circumstances of the crash is ongoing.
