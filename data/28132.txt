Jacksonville, FL â€” A driver is dead after crashing into a utility pole during a high-speed police chase on Jacksonville's westside Tuesday night.

The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office says just before 6:30 pm, officers noticed a vehicle driving recklessly through a parking lot near Lem Turner Road and I-95, almost hitting a pedestrian.

JSO attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle, but the driver failed to stop and fled south on I-95 and continued onto I-10 westbound in the emergency lane.

The driver then lost control of the vehicle, went off the road and hit a utility pole near Chaffee Road.

The driver, who has not been identified, died at the scene.
