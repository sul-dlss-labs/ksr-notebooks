The coroner Friday released the name of a man killed by a gunman who was himself killed during a shootout with Pasadena police.

Gevork Minissian, 70, was a Pasadena resident.

Officers were called about 2:35 p.m. Tuesday to the 600 block of Sunnyslope Avenue, near Orange Grove Boulevard, after the suspect allegedly shot the victim now identified as Minissian, according to Pasadena Police Department Chief John Perez.

It was not known what led to the shooting.

“We have no evidence that this crime was gang-related or related in any way to other crimes,” Perez said.

The suspect allegedly tried to flee from police by jumping into a woman’s car and attempting to carjack her, Perez said. However, the man was unable to steal the car and exchanged gunfire with police before running on to Sunnyslope Avenue.

The man allegedly attempted to carjack a second woman, but again failed to steal the vehicle and held the woman at gunpoint until he was cornered by police in the area of East Villa Street and North Sunnyslope Avenue, Perez said.

The man exchanged fire with police and was struck by at least one gunshot, though Perez said it was not known if he was struck by an officer’s bullet or if his wound was self-inflicted.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. His name was not released, though police said he was in his 20s

Minissian was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.

The two women the suspect allegedly attempted to carjack were evaluated and treated at the scene for unknown injuries. No officers were reported injured.

Anyone with information on the shooting was asked to call the Pasadena Police Department at 626-744-4241.
