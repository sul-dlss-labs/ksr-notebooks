An early morning police chase in Riverside ended in a fiery crash that split the car in two and ejected the driver who was on fire at the time. He later died in the hospital, an official said.

The chase started at 1:38 a.m. Friday, Dec. 19, when an officer spotted a driver in a truck going the wrong way on a one-way segment of Lemon Street south of Mission Avenue in Downtown, said Riverside police Officer Javier Cabrera.

The officer followed the vehicle and saw the driver, later identified by coroner’s officials as 28-year-old Mike Santoyo, of Riverside, smash into a parked car on University Avenue. The officer got behind the vehicle and tried to pull it over, but Santoyo backed up and sped away east on University, Cabrera said.

The officer gave chase at speeds reaching 80 mph until Santoyo smashed into a palm tree at University and Eucalyptus avenues. The vehicle broke in half and burst into flames on impact, a police news release said.

Santoyo, who was alone in the truck, was thrown from the vehicle and was on fire. Officers extinguished the flames and paramedics rushed him to a hospital where he died at 7:55 p.m., a Riverside police news release and coroner’s officials said.

Nearby roads were closed for several hours while police investigated.

Anybody with information is asked to call the police department at 951-526-5700.
