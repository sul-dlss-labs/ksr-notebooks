A state attorney has cleared two St. Petersburg Police officers in the July 16 fatal shooting of Carlos Crompton, a suspect wanted for attempted homicide.



"I have determined that Officers Brian Burton and Joseph Heer were in the performance of their lawful duties when they approached Crompton, and as they did so, he reached into his vehicle and pulled out his handgun," Pinellas Pasco State Attorney Bernie McCabe said.



"He then turned toward the officers and, while looking directly at them, pointed his firearm at them," McCabe continued. "Officers Burton and Heer then fire as Crompton fired at them. The actions of Crompton were such that Officers Burton and Heer has every reason to be justifiably in fear for their own lives as well as the lives of their fellow officers."



According to police, the officers fired at Crompton after he allegedly fired at them while they tried to make an arrest.



Police said Crompton was wanted for an attempted homicide earlier that day which left the shooting victim, Crompton's ex-girlfriend, with life-threatening injuries.



The officers will remain on administrative duty until the St. Petersburg Police Department concludes its own internal investigation of the shooting.
