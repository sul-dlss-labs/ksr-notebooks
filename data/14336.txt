CHICAGO (STMW) --A man is dead and three other people -- including an infant -- were hospitalized following a crash Friday night in the Humboldt Park neighborhood on the West Side.

The crash happened about 9:45 p.m., when police saw shots being fired from a vehicle in the 2300 block of West Division Street, police said.

Officers tried to stop the vehicle, but the car took off and crashed into a pole near the intersection of Ashland and Grand avenues, police said.

A weapon was recovered at the scene, police said.

The driver was identified as 26-year-old Rigoberto Llera, authorities said.

Llera, of the 7600 block of North Bosworth Avenue, was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where he died at 10:45 p.m., according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office.

An autopsy performed Saturday found Llera died of multiple injuries from a car stricking a fixed object, and his death was ruled an accident.

Two women, ages 26 and 23, were taken to John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital of Cook County in serious condition, Greer said.

A 9-month-old boy was taken to Children's Memorial Hospital for observation only, Greer said.
