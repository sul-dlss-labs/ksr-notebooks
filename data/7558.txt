Family and friends of a man shot to death by a Birmingham police officer last weekend said the shooting wasn't justified and are calling for more community say in police policy and procedures.

At a press conference held today in front of Reginald Wylie Osby's Ensley home, his grieving widow said her husband's death was a tragedy.

"For the family," said Christine Cook, "it's unspeakable."



Osby, 59, was stabbing his stepson, 27-year-old Deron Cook, with a barbecue fork when a Birmingham police officer fatally shot Osby on Oct.12, police said. Osby and other family members had been under attack by Cook, Osby's mentally ill stepson, prior to officers arriving, police said.

Cook came to the house and attacked his mother and Osby and also cut his 13-year-old brother on the hand as the teen attempted to protect his mother, police said.

When officers arrived, they found Osby stabbing Deron Cook. An officer, whose name hasn't been released, ordered Osby to drop the fork but Osby continued with the attack. The officer fired one shot, killing Osby.



The shooting is under review by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation.

Deron Cook has been charged with attempted murder and remains in the county jail.

Christine Cook said her husband was holding a barbecue fork, but not stabbing her son when police arrived. Osby's daughter said they weren't even in the same room when police arrived.

Neighborhood activist Marcella Lockett, who said her son is a Birmingham police officer, called for the creation of a police advisory board and a meeting with Police Chief A.C. Roper.

"It's time to talk before any more tragedies happen," Lockett said.
