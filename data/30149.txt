Hamilton Township Police Chief Scott Hughes said two of his officers were defending themselves when they fired shots at a man, killing him.Anthony Williams, 57, died Sunday night at his house on Adams Road.At 6:18 p.m., Williams' neighbor called 911 after his partner went to the neighbor's house seeking help. According to the 911 call and radio dispatch recordings, she told the neighbor Williams was intoxicated, threatening suicide and shooting a gun in the house.Hamilton Township police officers arrived and began securing a perimeter.Hughes said Sgt. Chris Wall, a 21-year member of the department, and Officer Josh Clift, who was hired last year were both in the backyard when they spotted Williams."He emerged on the back porch, where he had a firearm in his hand," Hughes said. At 6:55 p.m., he points the firearm at our officers, causing our officers to defend themselves and use lethal force."Williams died at the scene. Hughes said Williams did not have a criminal history.The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation was called in to investigate the shooting. Because of that, Hughes said he doesn't know how many shots where fired, how many hit Williams or if Williams fired his weapon also.Hughes said Williams was holding a Taurus 357 revolver."To say that I'm proud of Sgt. Wall and Officer Josh Clift would not do it justice. This situation could have turned significantly worse for my officers, and I'm proud that they reacted the way they did, with the training, and I appreciated the statement that was released from the deceased family," Hughes said.The Williams' family released this statement:"We are extremely thankful no officers were harmed, and we want to personally thank every officer who responded and put yourselves at risk on a daily basis. It was a tragic event, but thanks to the Hamilton Twp police and Warren County sheriff, our grandma is alive today. We very much so back the blue and are glad no one else was harmed. We ask everyone to respect our privacy during this time."There is no police body camera footage of the incident because Hamilton Township officers do not wear body cams."That is a cost that our budget currently just cannot sustain. The purchase of the body camera is not the expense. It's the ongoing storage, maintenance, potentially having to hire personnel to do redactions," Hughes said.
