A suspected Target shoplifter was killed Sunday after he tried to bite a cop and fled in a stolen car, which burst into flames when it crashed into a medical building in Union County during the ensuing chase, officials said.

The bizarre police pursuit began around 4 p.m. when two Union Township police officers approached the man in the Target parking lot as he tried to leave with several hundred dollars in over-the-counter medicine, the Union County prosecutor's office said Monday.

The man, whose name has not been released, tried to bite one of the officers, authorities said. He then jumped in a Jaguar and sped off, authorities said.

With police giving chase into Springfield, the man failed to negotiate a turn and lost control of the luxury car.

The Jaguar overturned, crashed into Advanced Pain Care on Springfield Avenue and burst into flames. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.

Three police officers who tried to free him from the burning car were treated for smoke inhalation at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston.

The Jaguar was reported stolen last week in Irvington, officials said.

Anyone with information is asked to call Sgt. Michael Manochio of the Union County Prosecutor's Office at 908-966-2287.
