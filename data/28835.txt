SAN CLEMENTE (CBSLA) — A suspect was killed during a deputy-involved shooting in San Clemente Wednesday afternoon.

The shooting happened around 1:15 p.m. at El Camino Real and Avenida San Gabriel in front of the Hotel Miramar said Orange County sheriff's Sgt. Dennis Breckner.

Two deputies assigned to the department's homeless outreach team were in the area when something prompted them to contact the man outside the hotel, Breckner said.

Shortly after approaching the suspect, a physical altercation erupted between the suspect and deputies prompting the shooting, Breckner said.

Surveillance video from a nearby business indicates the suspect was attempting to grab a weapon from one of the deputies, the sergeant said.

"Clearly shows a physical altercation where it appears the male attempted to get control of the deputies weapon and shortly after that the deputy-involved shooting occurred," Breckner said.

According to witnesses at the scene, a deputy screamed that the man had hold of the weapon and then two shots were fired.

The officers performed CPR but the man was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Locals in the area said the man frequents the area and shortly before he was killed had gone inside a nearby store to buy some food.

South El Camino Real was blocked from Avenida Ramona to Ave. San Gabriel for the ongoing investigation and was expected to be opened around midnight.

The man's name and age were not immediately disclosed.

Sheriff's investigators will be providing video of the incident to the Orange County District Attorney's Office.
