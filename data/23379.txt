Chesterfield County police have identified the teenager who was fatally shot early Monday by an off-duty Richmond police officer.

Chesterfield police said Jacob L. Baumgart, 15, was shot by the officer after the teen produced a pistol and tried to rob a man who was selling an Xbox. Richmond police earlier identified the officer as Robert Misegades, who was also shot during an exchange of gunfire. He was treated at a hospital and released.

At 12:30 a.m. Monday, police responded to the Chestertowne Shopping Center in the 4200 block of Beulah Road, which is in the northern part of the county. The shooting occurred as two groups of males met “to facilitate the sale of an electronic gaming system,” Chesterfield police said in a news release.

On Monday, Chesterfield police withheld Baumgart’s identity, citing a new state law regarding the names of slain juveniles. On Tuesday, Chesterfield police said they were releasing the teen’s name after obtaining consent from his next of kin.

The incident remains under investigation.
