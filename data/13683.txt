Michael Carter-Williams worked a little overtime, Saturday night.

The Hamilton native and NBA rookie pushed the Philadelphia 76ers into double overtime, during a thrilling 125-122 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, Nov. 10.

A 6-foot-6, 185-pound point guard, Carter-Williams hit a big 3-pointer tying the game with 11.3 second left in the second session. He ended the night netting 21-points, while establishing a new career-high of 13 assists, in the losing effort.

Picked by many to be one of the worst teams in the league, Philadelphia has been an early season surprise jumping out to a 3-0 start, including a big 114-110 victory over the defending world champion Miami Heat, Oct. 30.

Carter-Williams has been earning his keep averaging 18.7 points, 8.1 assists and 5.9 rebounds in his first seven games.

According to ESPN, Carter-Williams has joined Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history with at least 130 points and 50 assists in their first seven career games. Robertson went on to win Rookie of the Year and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame.

Carter-Williams will return home to play the Boston Celtics, Wednesday, Jan. 29.
