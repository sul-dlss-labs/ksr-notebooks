Authorities believe a man shot and injured a Vance woman before killing himself Thursday afternoon.

The woman is recovering from gunshot wounds to her arm, according to an Orangeburg County Sheriff’s Office incident report.

The Orangeburg County Coroner’s Office has not yet released the name of the deceased man.

At 4 p.m. Thursday, deputies arrived at a home on the 2200 block of Vance Road where they saw a woman sitting in a chair holding her left arm in the air.

The woman’s son told deputies that she’d been shot and then they noticed two gunshot wounds in her left upper forearm.

The woman told deputies that her boyfriend was still on the property, but she wasn’t sure of his exact location.

Medics transported the woman to the hospital.

As investigators searched for the woman’s boyfriend at the rear of the residence, a deputy reported seeing him in a nearby wooded area and a pond.

Investigators said he shot and killed himself as they approached.
