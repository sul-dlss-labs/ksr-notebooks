Department of Public Safety spokesman Sgt. Mark Tackett said a DPS trooper tried to stop a 2015 Nissan Maxima for a traffic violation on U.S. 82 in Fannin County at 11:11 p.m. Wednesday. The male driver did not stop.

The man continued west on U.S. 82. and avoided "tire deflation tools," according to authorities. Meanwhile, authorities said they learned the Maxima had been reported stolen.

Authorities said the man continued driving on Farm-to-Market Road 1752 where he swerved and crashed into a trooper's patrol car between Farm-to-Market roads 898 and 4050 in Ector, about 50 miles north-northeast of Dallas.

Investigators said the man then drove toward a Bonham police officer who was assisting in the pursuit. The trooper fired his service weapon, striking the suspect.

The male was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas by air ambulance, according to Tackett. He later died at the hospital.

The incident is under investigation by the Texas Rangers.

Authorities say a police officer was involved in a shooting after a chase that ended in Fannin County at about midnight Thursday.
