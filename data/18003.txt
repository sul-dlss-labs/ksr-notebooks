A 65-year-old man was shot and killed by Stafford County deputies early Monday after the man fired a shot at deputies who had responded to a traffic accident, police said.

Sheriff's spokeswoman M.C. Morris Moncure said deputies went to Cool Spring Road in southern Stafford about 2 a.m. after receiving a call reporting a crash. The caller told police that a vehicle had been traveling south at a high rate of speed when it jumped the median and crossed into the northbound lanes before stopping on the side of the road.

When deputies arrived, Moncure said, there was no one in the vehicle, but a man was seen standing on the northbound side a short distance away.

As deputies approached the man, they noticed he was holding a handgun. Police said the man then fired at the deputies, who returned fire, striking the man.

The man was rushed to Mary Washington Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No deputies were injured in the incident. It was not immediately clear why the man shot at the deputies.

Police have not yet identified the victim, other than to say he was a white male. Cool Springs Road was shut down for several hours Monday morning as the incident was investigated.

Moncure said police hope to release more information later Monday.

It is the second time in less than two months that a Stafford deputy has been fired on in the line of duty. Deputy Brandon Boyle was shot four times June 7 after responding to a call on Windsor Ridge Court off Forbes Street. Boyle was seriously injured but survived the shooting.

Joshua Sumter, 18, is charged with multiple offenses, including four counts of attempted capital murder, in connection with that incident.
