Authorities have released more details about a deadly shootout involving a Michigan State Police trooper up north last week.

The shooting happened Friday during a traffic stop in Lake Township. A trooper pulled over a vehicle, which had two men and a woman inside. Authorities say one of the men got out of the car, and started running away while shooting at the trooper.

The trooper was hit several times and also returned fire at the suspect, who died at the scene.

Authorities weren't sure at first if the suspect had been shot by the trooper, or if he died after shooting himself. Michigan State Police now confirm the suspect, 32-year-old Douglas Sawyer of Fenton, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging gunfire with the trooper.

Sawyer had prior arrests for home invasion, drug crimes, and weapons violations. At the time of the traffic stop, Sawyer had three warrants out for his arrest.

Authorities say the trooper has since been released from the hospital after being treated for non-life threatening injuries. His name is not being released.
