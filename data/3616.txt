A man was fatally shot early yesterday during a gunfight with the police after he tried to rob a 24-hour carwash in Brooklyn, the police and witnesses said.

The suspect exchanged gunfire with three officers about 1:50 a.m. outside DT's Car Wash, at Linden Boulevard and Fountain Avenue in East New York. No police officers, car wash employees or bystanders were injured. But the suspect, an 18-year-old identified by the police as Rashawn Sharif Moody of East New York, was hit at least five times in the head, chest and arm, and died shortly after being taken to Brookdale University Hospital and Medical Center.

The police later arrested three men from the area -- Joseph Gentry, 20; Jayshawn Steel, 17; and Gillford Brown, 16 -- who they believed took part in the attempted robbery, and recovered a Sig Sauer 9-millimeter pistol at the scene.

Following standard procedure, the Police Department and the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, reassigned the officers to administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation into the shooting. But Paul J. Browne, the department's deputy commissioner for public information, said that a preliminary investigation into the incident had found that the shooting appeared to be within department guidelines.
