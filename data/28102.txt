Officers had tried to stop the driver of an SUV about 10:30 p.m. Saturday after it sped through two red lights — one at Broadway Boulevard and Oates Road, and another at Broadway Boulevard and Duck Creek Drive.

Police pursued the SUV for about five minutes, traveling through Mesquite and Garland on Interstate 30 and Interstate 635, but they slowed down because they were concerned the driver was endangering lives by speeding more than 100 mph on I-635 and turning off his headlights.

As a Department of Public Safety helicopter tracked the SUV from a distance, the driver, 19-year-old Adrian Maldonado, didn’t slow down, police said. He exited I-635 and ran another red light before he crashed into a car at Northwest Highway and Shiloh Road, authorities said.

Maldonado and a passenger, whom police identified as 19-year-old Denise Vivas, were caught after they ran from the scene of the crash.

The car’s occupants — a man, woman, and their two children — were hospitalized after the crash, police said. The adults were identified as Hugo Alberto-Maturino and Miriam Minaya, both 30 years old.

A 1-year-old girl, Alice Maturino, died after being ejected from the car, authorities said.

The parents and their son, 2-year-old Cole Maturino, suffered serious injuries, police said.

Before authorities publicly identified the victims on Monday, police said the children were 2 and 3.

Family set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the cost of Alice’s funeral expenses, calling her a joyful and beautiful baby girl.

“My heart is in tears as I write this for my niece,” Alice’s aunt wrote on the GoFundMe page. “She was very loved by her parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and so many other people that learned to love her.”

Alice had her first birthday earlier this month, according to the GoFundMe page. The campaign had received over $7,500 in donations as of Tuesday afternoon.

Maldonado faces a charge of intoxication manslaughter and three counts of intoxication assault, as well as a charge of evading arrest with a vehicle, causing the death of another. He also had a warrant for a probation violation stemming from a burglary charge in Dallas County, police said.
