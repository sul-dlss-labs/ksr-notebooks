VERNON TOWNSHIP, MI — Police have identified the driver killed in a fiery crash after his truck struck a tree during a police pursuit, the Clare County Sheriff's Department reports.

The driver was Duane Stahl, 46, of Clare, the sheriff's department reports.

About 12:30 a.m. Friday, Oct. 31, Clare County Sheriff's deputies in Farwell tried to pull over a red 1992 Chevrolet pickup truck after it ran a stop sign and was being driven erratically.

Deputies deployed spike strips during the chase, but the truck kept going, Clare County Undersheriff Dwayne Miedzianowski said.

The chase began in the area of Vandecar and Main in Clare County's Farwell and ended in Isabella County as the truck was eastbound on Stevenson Lake Road and crossed Mission, where it crashed into a tree and erupted in flames, Miedzianowski said, estimating the chase went on for about 15 miles.

Deputies and Clare police officers attempted to extinguish the fire and extract Stahl, but were unsuccessful. Responding medical professionals pronounced the driver dead at the scene, Miedzianowski said.

"It's just unfortunate for everyone involved," Miedzianowski said. "It's unfortunate the situation ended up the way it did."

The chase reached speeds of approximately 80 mph at some point, he said, according to the sheriff's department report. Traffic was light at the time, he said.

The Michigan State Police is investigating the crash.

The dash camera was not working in the Clare County Sheriff's Department vehicle leading the pursuit following the suspect vehicle, Miedzianowski said. The department has instructed maintenance personnel to look at cameras in all of the cars, he said.

Funeral arrangements are pending with Clark Family Funeral Chapel & Cremation Service, according to Stahl's obituary.
