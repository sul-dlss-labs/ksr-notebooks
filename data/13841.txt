AZUSA >> A motorcyclist killed in a collision earlier this week was identified as a 35-year-old Azusa man.

Ed Winter, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Department of Coroner, said Marc Bradley Stark died of multiple traumatic injuries and the death was ruled as an accident.

The fatal crash happened at 10:48 a.m. Monday on Arrow Highway, west of Homerest Avenue which is in the unincorporated county area.

California Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Dulong said a motorcycle westbound on Arrow Highway approached the back of a Ford Explorer at an excessive speed.

Dulong said for unknown reasons, the motorcycle rear-ended the sport utility vehicle. After the collision, he said the motorcycle overturned and dragged the rider for a short distance before coming to rest.

The motorcyclist was pronounced dead at the scene. Dulong said the motorcycle was reported stolen from Temecula.

The 60-year-old Pasadena woman driving the SUV wasnÂ’t injured.
