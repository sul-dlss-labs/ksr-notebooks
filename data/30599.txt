Update 7/16/21, 10 AM: West Ridge alderman Debra Silverstein issued a statement on Hershel Weinberger's death, including the following passage. "We must all take this as a stark reminder to always drive safelyâ€”especially on residential streets. Drive slowly and always come to a complete stop at stop signs and traffic lights. Be extra cautious around schools, parks, and places of worship. We are fortunate to live in a vibrant community and the side streets are packed with children playing and families enjoying the summer. We all need to act to keep our neighborhood safe."

Update 7/16/21, 9 AM: According to Police News Affairs, the off-duty police officer who fatally struck Hershel Weinberger has been issued a citation for failure to exercise due care for a person in the roadway.

Witnesses said the off-duty police officer who fatally struck Hershel Weinberger, 9, on his bike last night in West Ridge ran a stop sign, but as of this afternoon the officer has received no citations or charges.

According to Police News Affairs, on Wednesday, July 14, around 8 p.m., Hershel was biking east on the north sidewalk of Chase Avenue when he crossed Sacramento Avenue in the crosswalk. In Chicago, it's legal for children younger than 12 to ride on the sidewalk.

The off-duty officer, 48, was driving north on Sacramento in a Toyota Tundra full-size pickup truck, police said.

According to a report by Jenna Barnes from WGN News, "Witnesses say the boy was crossing the street at a crosswalk when a pickup truck [driver] appeared to run a stop sign and hit him." The intersection has four-way stop signs. The officer appeared to drag the bike before coming to a stop, and neighbors rushed to help the boy, Barnes said.
