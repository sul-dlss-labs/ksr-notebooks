The Greene County Sheriff's Office said late Friday that a man they had originally attempted to check the well being of was found deceased from a self-inflicted gunshot wound a few hours after a standoff began.

Greene County deputies had a road blocked Friday evening just southwest of the Springfield city limits as they dealt with the standoff situation.

The sheriff’s office says it responded to a home in the 3200 block of West Edward Street at about 4 p.m., to check the well-being of a man there.

When deputies arrived, they were met with gunfire, according to a post on the sheriff’s office’s social media accounts.

It does not appear anyone was shot.

Deputies then blocked the road and had neighbors evacuate their homes. They tried to negotiate with the man to surrender, according to the post.

More than a dozen patrol vehicles responded to the area and a BearCat armored vehicle was called out to the scene.

Deputies could be heard using a loudspeaker to try to communicate with someone at about 5:30 p.m. After 8 p.m., Greene County released the update that the subject was deceased. They say he was a 48-year-old male.

The sheriff’s office says the initial call to check the man’s well-being came from Missouri State University where someone had information the man, a student, was possibly suicidal.

Deputies continue to process the scene and residents of the neighborhood have been allowed back in their homes, the release says.
