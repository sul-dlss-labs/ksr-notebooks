GONZALES — A Gonzales couple has filed a lawsuit seeking damages resulting from a Dec. 18 high-speed police chase that left two people dead.

The Advocate reports Warren Porta III and his wife brought the lawsuit in in state court on Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed against the city of Gonzales and Police Officer Brent Amy over injuries Porta received at the conclusion of Amy’s pursuit of a man and woman suspected of shoplifting at Tanger Outlet Center in Gonzales.

Amy chased suspects Kevdrinka T. Williams, 25, of Baton Rouge, and Tremaine R. Wickem, 20, of New Orleans, at high speeds on La. 30 until the fleeing vehicle attempted to pass several other vehicles on the shoulder of the highway near La. 74 in St. Gabriel, went out of control and collided with Porta’s truck.

Attorneys Andre Gauthier and Lee Amedee, representing the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, accuse Amy and the Gonzales Police Department of negligence and disregard for the safety of others for initiating the chase.

There was no need for Amy to start chasing Williams and Wickem, who both died in the collision with Porta’s vehicle, since Amy already had identified them as shoplifting suspects before they fled, the lawsuit says.

Also, the suit says, the chase was unnecessary because shoplifting is a misdemeanor offense.

Gonzales Police Chief Sherman Jackson declined Thursday to comment on the lawsuit, although he announced Jan. 23 a Police Department internal investigation uncovered no wrongdoing stemming from the police chase of the alleged shoplifters. Gonzales City Attorney Ryland Percy did not return calls Thursday seeking comment.

The Portas requested a jury trial of their lawsuit, according to court records.
