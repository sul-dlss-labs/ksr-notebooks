Investigators say a man choked a woman in Orange County Friday night, set her house on fire and then returned to the scene and started shooting at deputies. At least one Orange County deputy returned fire and Orange County Sheriff John Mina said the gunman, identified as 43-year-old Phillip Francis, was hospitalized in critical condition. On February 13, 2021, Phillip Francis succumbed to his injuries, according to officials with the Orange County Sheriff's Office.Mina said no deputies were injured in the shooting and the woman who was choked is doing OK. The Orange County Sheriff's Office shared a photo on Twitter of the gun they said was recovered at the scene. It all happened in the area of Indian Hill Road and Ridgemont Road, in the Pine Hills area. According to a criminal complaint, authorities were called to the home around 3:20 p.m. Friday. Francis’ ex-girlfriend told officials he had strangled her. Deputies met with her, made a report and they and the victim left.At 5:32 p.m., officials received another call that the house was on fire. Detectives say it appeared as if the fire was intentionally ignited as evidenced by forced entry to the home and a gas can being left outside.Investigators say the victim returned to the home with family members to try and salvage some belongings but noticed a safe containing a handgun was missing.At 10:55 p.m., while a detective was writing up a warrant for Francis’ arrest, he allegedly went back to the home in a car.“He came up really fast. Like he intentionally wanted to do something. We don't know if he was targeting the deputies at first,” Sheriff John Mina said.Authorities said Francis immediately opened fire when deputy William Hatch approached him. Hatch fired back, hitting Francis in the head. He was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center and later died.Mina said Hatch has been with the sheriff's office for about four years. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will be investigating the deputy-involved shooting.
