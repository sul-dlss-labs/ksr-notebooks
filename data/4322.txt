A Frederick County sheriff's deputy fatally shot a shotgun-wielding man in front of the man's mother yesterday afternoon, the county sheriff's office said.

According to Jennifer Bailey, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office, the deputy was called to the 4300 block of Araby Church Road in Frederick at 2:16 p.m. by a woman who said that her son, Charles Sines, was inside her house making threatening statements and brandishing a shotgun.

When the deputy arrived, he made contact with the mother on her front porch. As he was speaking to her, he was confronted by Sines, 68, who was carrying a loaded 12-gauge shotgun in the house's hallway, five feet away, Bailey said. The deputy repeatedly ordered Sines to put the weapon down, the spokeswoman said.

Sines did not comply, and the officer drew his 9mm pistol and shot him once in the chest, Bailey said.

The 37-year-old deputy, a seven-year veteran of the force, administered first aid and called for an ambulance, Bailey said. Sines was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Bailey did not immediately identify the deputy.

The officer has been put on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation, which Bailey described as a standard procedure in all incidents in which a police officer uses deadly force.
