Two officers shot and killed a 28-year-old man Friday after he confronted them with a gun when they tried to serve a warrant for drug sales, police said.

Marc Maxey, a resident of the North Waterman Avenue home where the warrant was being served, brandished a 9-millimeter handgun, said Sgt. Mark Garcia. Officers fired several rounds at Maxey, who died at a hospital.

The names of the officers were not released because the incident is under investigation. A large quantity of narcotics was seized at the home, officials said.
