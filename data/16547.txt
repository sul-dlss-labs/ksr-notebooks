Authorities on Sunday identified the man an Itasca County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot after the suspect allegedly pointed the gun at several deputies.

Adam R. Schneider, 31, of Cohasset, was killed early Saturday outside his home in the 400 block of 2nd Street NW. in Cohasset, according to the Ramsey County medical examiner’s office.

Also identified was the deputy, Stephen Snyder, who shot Schneider. Snyder, who has been with the sheriff’s office for four years, is on standard administrative leave as the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigates the incident.

According to the preliminary investigation:

Sheriff’s deputies responded about 2:50 a.m. to a 911 call of a disturbance at Schneider’s home. When deputies arrived, Schneider was standing outside the home holding a shotgun.

He ignored repeated orders from deputies to put the gun down and then pointed the weapon at the deputies. Snyder fired his gun and struck Schneider. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he died.

Schneider’s criminal history in Minnesota reveals no serious offenses. He was convicted in 2013 of disorderly conduct and in 2004 for being under 21 and in possession of alcohol.
