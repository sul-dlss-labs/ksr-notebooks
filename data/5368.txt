A man who died after police shot him with a Taser stun gun was identified Wednesday as James Nunez, 27, of Santa Ana, police said.

Nunez, who died after being chased about half a mile on foot and shot with the electric-shock device Tuesday, was wanted on a “no-bail” warrant for an unspecified narcotics violation, said Santa Ana Police Cmdr. Baltazar De La Riva.

A small amount of what is believed to be methamphetamine was found in the van Nunez had been driving and in his clothes, he said.
