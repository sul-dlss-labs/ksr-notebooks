Suspects Arrested, Charged in Incident at 9800 Ribbonwood

September 09, 2013 - Charges have been filed against four bank robbery suspects arrested in an incident in which shots were fired at two Harris County Sheriff's deputies at 9800 Ribbonwood about 2:20 p.m. last Thursday (Sept. 5).



The suspects, James Burrel Gibson (b/m, DOB: 7-17-92), Victor Allen Woods, Jr. (b/m, DOB: 11-24-76), Jeremie Tramain Washington (b/m, DOB: 5-22-88) and Tremarcus Rayvon McAdams (b/m, DOB: 2-28-91), are charged with aggravated assault against a public servant and aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon in the 209th State District Court. Photos of the four suspects are not available at this time.



A fifth suspect, Kendrick Lee Amest (b/m, DOB: 12-4-83), was pronounced dead at the scene.



The two deputies who returned fire were not injured in this incident.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant M. Brady and Officers N. Rosenblatt, E. Zugner and J. Saldana reported:



The five suspects robbed a Wells Fargo bank in North Harris County. While fleeing, the suspect's vehicle was located by Harris County Sheriff's deputies. When the deputies attempted to initiate a traffic stop, the suspects fled and a vehicle pursuit ensued. The suspects subsequently crashed their van at the above location on Ribbonwood and exited the vehicle. Upon doing so, suspect Amest then fired on the two deputies, who returned fire, fatally striking him. Another suspect pointed a pistol at the deputies, who in fear of their safety, discharged their duty weapons, wounding him. All four suspects were arrested at the scene.



As is customary when a member of law enforcement discharges his or her duty weapon in the city limits, this incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide Division and the Harris County District Attorney's office.
