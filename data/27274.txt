An Oklahoma City man was killed Thursday night, Jan. 2 on Interstate 40 west of Yukon when he was struck by an Oklahoma City police car and another vehicle.

The auto-pedestrian crash victim was identified Monday as Terence Eugene Kilgore, 59.

Oklahoma City Police reported the crash occurred at 9:21 p.m. Jan. 2 on westbound I-40 west of Banner Road.

A vehicle had become disabled on the outside shoulder of I-40 near S Manning Road. Kilgore, the driver, left the vehicle to get gas and later returned with the help of a good Samaritan.

The disabled vehicleâ€™s owner, now a pedestrian, was crossing I-40 from south to north and entered the westbound lanes of traffic.

An Oklahoma City Police car traveling westbound on I-40 struck Kilgore. Sgt. John Ricketts, with 24 years of service at OCPD, was driving the police car.

At least one other vehicle traveling westbound also struck the pedestrian.

Kilgore was pronounced dead at the scene. No other injuries were reported.
