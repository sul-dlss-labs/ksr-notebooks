ARVADA, Colo. – Police on Monday released the names of the woman killed in a suspected domestic violence incident last week and the man accused of killing her, who was shot and killed by police shortly after he allegedly stabbed the woman to death.

Arvada police said Monday that officers responded to a call at 5360 Everett Street just after 5 a.m. last Friday in which the caller said that a woman had been stabbed to death.

Police identified the woman Monday as Katrina Perez, 40, and said she was a victim of domestic violence.

Police said the man suspected of stabbing Perez, 40-year-old Manuel Arebalo, was still in the apartment when officers arrived and entered.

Police said last week that Arebalo was armed with an “edged weapon.”

On Monday, Arvada police said officers “engaged Arebalo and would eventually shoot Arebalo to defend themselves and attempt to help Katrina.”

Perez and Arebalo were both pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured in the incident, nor was the third person who was inside the apartment.

"This is a tragic case with a devastating ending,” Arvada Police Chief Link Strate. “Domestic violence affects so many in our communities; our thoughts are with these families and our officers.”
