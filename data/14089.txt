HAMMOND | A man died late Sunday after being shot in an officer-related shooting in the 6600 block of Ohio Avenue, police said.

Hammond Police Chief Brian Miller said the shooting happened about 9:15 p.m. after police were called to a domestic disturbance that involved a stabbing.

The suspect in the disturbance was shot by a Hammond officer and died from his wounds, Miller said.

Officials had not identified the man as of Sunday night.

It was unclear late Sunday what was the condition of the stabbing victim.

The shooting happened less than a mile from Morton Senior High School in the city's Hessville neighborhood.

Miller said the investigation was turned over to Indiana State Police because of the officer's involvement, which is standard in officer-related shootings.

Indiana State Police said troopers were on their way to the scene late Sunday. Troopers said they did not yet have any information about what happened but expected more information to be released Monday morning.
