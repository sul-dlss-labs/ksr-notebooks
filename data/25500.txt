BURLINGTON CITY - A 20-year-old man fatally shot himself after a standoff with police here, authorities say.

The incident began around 6:30 p.m. Sunday when officers responded to a report of a disturbance on the 100 block of Fernwood Avenue, according to an account from Burlington City police.

The man, a Burlington City resident, was barricaded in a rear garage while armed with a rifle, the account said.

Police said the man, who had allegedly pointed the gun at someone earlier in the day, "appeared to be in a psychiatric emergency."

The man's name is not being released "due to the ongoing investigation," police said.

Negotiators attempted to convince the man to surrender, but a gunshot was heard inside the garage, the account said.

A New Jersey State Police TEAMS Unit found the man dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound a short time later.

Police said the incident closed roads in the area until around 11:40 p.m.

Agencies that responded to the stand-off also included the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office, the Burlington Township police department and the Burlington City Fire Department.
