MARKHAM, Ill. (AP) _ Court documents show that relatives of a 95-year-old World War II veteran who was killed by a suburban Chicago police officer have agreed to settle their wrongful death lawsuit.

Park Forest Police Officer Craig Taylor was dispatched to the assisted-living facility where John Wrana Jr. lived in July 2013 after a staff member reported the man had become combative. Wrana was shot five times with a beanbag gun before he dropped the knife he was wielding. He died hours later.

Wrana’s stepdaughter filed a $5 million wrongful death lawsuit in June 2014.

The Daily Southtown newspaper reports that Park Forest recently agreed to a $1.1 million settlement. None of the defendants named in the lawsuit admits liability or wrongful conduct.

Taylor was acquitted in Wrana’s death in February 2015.
