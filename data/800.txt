A brief police chase ended early Thursday in a crash that killed a passenger and critically injured the driver, authorities said.

The pursuit began about 2 a.m., when police approached two men in a car that was double-parked facing east in a westbound lane of Parthenia Street. The men were allegedly making a narcotics transaction, according to a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman.

The driver turned off the vehicle’s lights, sped off and crashed into a concrete railroad pillar near Parthenia and Reseda Boulevard. Jose Israel Victoria, 23, of Winnetka, the passenger, was killed, said Capt. David Campbell of the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.
