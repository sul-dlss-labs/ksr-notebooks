A man who led police on a high-speed chase last year was sentenced Friday to 10 years in prison for killing a pedestrian he struck and killed while reaching speeds of 90 mph through residential areas.

Devon Horton, 25, was already on extended supervision for a 2007 fleeing conviction when he was stopped March 1, 2010. But he took off and careened through the city's north side before ditching the van and running away.

On the way he struck and killed Melinde Moore, 21, in the 2700 block of N. 20th St. The collision was so hard it set off the air bag in the passenger side of the van Horton was driving, according to court records.

He later went to her family, whom he knew, and expressed his condolences, but didn't admit his involvement. He was arrested three months later after forcing a tactical situation when he refused to come out of a house where he was staying with a girlfriend and small children.

Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet made the sentence consecutive to Horton's current term, which ends next year. After his release, he must serve five years of extended supervision.
