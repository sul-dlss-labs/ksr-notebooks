An Anderson man riding a motorcycle died following a vehicle pursuit that ended in a Palo Cedro area crash earlier today.

The man was identified by the Shasta County Coroner's Office as Casey Crye, 33.

A Shasta County sheriff's deputy was chasing the motorcyclist when he went off the roadway and crashed through a white picket fence in a quiet and wooded neighborhood near Maynard Road, just west of Deschutes Road and south of Highway 44.

A California Highway Patrol spokesman said the pursuit started around 11:45 a.m. after a sheriff's deputy spotted a speeding motorcyclist near Dersch and Deschutes roads.

The cyclist, who was wearing a helmet, refused to pull over and a subsequent pursuit ended after he crashed shortly after turning onto Maynard Road from Deschutes Road, the CHP spokesman said.

Investigators were still at the scene mid-afternoon, the Honda motorcycle on its side in the front of a home's yard.

The CHP spokesman said he was unaware of why Crye did not stop for the sheriff's deputy.

Electronic Shasta County Superior Court records show that Crye has a history of criminal behavior, including convictions for corporal injury, possession of a controlled substance, assault and reckless driving.
