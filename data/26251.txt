A standoff between police and an armed, barricaded woman at a Broken Arrow QuikTrip ended when she took her own life Monday.

Broken Arrow Police Department spokesman James Koch said crisis negotiators were “in active conversation” with the woman, who was in her mid-30s, when she turned the gun on herself.

The woman, whose name was not released, died at the scene.

A family member had called police just before 9 a.m. after the woman failed to report to work. The caller said a firearm was missing from the residence. While the caller was on the line with police, the woman called the relative and said she was armed and had locked herself in the restroom at the QuikTrip at 2400 E. Kenosha St., police reported.

No one was injured at the QuikTrip, according to the news release.
