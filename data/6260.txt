Northern Iowa woman dies of heart attack after domestic scene in her home

Nashua police say a 45-year-old woman has died of a heart attack just hours after they arrested her husband on domestic abuse charges.

Police were called at about 7:10 last night to the home of Dennis and Connie Hamm. The 52-year-old man was finally arrested after a brief stand-off with police and now sits in the Chickasaw County Jail on a charge of domestic abuse assault.

Connie Hamm was taken from the home to Floyd County Memorial Hospital in Charles City before being air-lifted to Allen Hospital in Waterloo, where authorities say she died.

Authorities are not saying at this time whether Connie Hammâ€™s heart attack was triggered due to domestic violence.
