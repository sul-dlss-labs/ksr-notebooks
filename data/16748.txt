PINON HILLS >> Sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a man when he drove a vehicle toward them in a threatening manner, authorities said Sunday.

Deputies were called to Pinon Hills on Saturday afternoon by an employee of the Phelan-Pinon Hills Community Services District, who had responded to an alarm at a facility on Snowcap Avenue, according to a San Bernardino County sheriff’s news release.

The employee discovered a man and a BMW sedan inside the facility’s fenced perimeter who was making irrational statements and said he had explosives, according to the release.

Deputies assigned to the sheriff’s Victor Valley station arrived shortly after 3:30 p.m. and started talking with the man who continued to make irrational statements, officials said.

He jumped in his car and drove around inside the fenced property, refusing to surrender to deputies, they said.

Deputies said a loud noise was heard, leading them to believe an explosive device may have been detonated, according to the release.

They retreated a short distance while waiting for help, including the sheriff’s Bomb Arson Detail, the release said.

Once backup arrived, a perimeter was established to ensure the car or any potential explosives wouldn’t leave the area.

According to sheriff’s reports, the man jumped in his car and drove toward the deputies in a threatening manner. Deputies fired on the man, fatally wounding him.

Sheriff’s officials have not said if there were any actual explosives at the scene.

Detectives assigned to the sheriff’s homicide division are investigating the incident. The man’s name is being withheld, pending notification of next of kin.

Anyone with information about the case is asked to contact sheriff’s Detective Scott Stafford or sheriff’s Sgt. Robert Warrick at 909-387-3589. Callers wishing to remain anonymous may call the WeTip Hotline at 800-78-CRIME (27463) or leave information on the WeTip Hotline at wetip.com.
