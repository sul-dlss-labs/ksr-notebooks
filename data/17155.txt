MERIDIANVILLE, AL (WAFF) - One man has died after an officer-involved shooting in Meridianville Wednesday night according to the Madison County Sheriff's Office.

Madison County Sheriff's deputies received a call about a man walking along the Highway 231/431 parkway with a gun in his waistband. Deputies say when they attempted to stop him, the man took off running.

Deputies chased after him and cornered the man in the Inspiration Pointe subdivision in Meridianville. Deputies say the man pulled his gun, and one of the deputies involved in the chase shot him.

Randy Sanders Jr.,33, was rushed to Huntsville Hospital for a gunshot wound. He died during surgery.

The deputy who fired the shot was also transported to the hospital for non-life threatening observation.

A Meridianville teenager is traumatized after listening to the Madison County deputy kill a Sanders outside his bedroom.

Things are quiet inside the neighborhood.

"This is a nice community," resident Tamala Gopher said.



But Wednesday night it was a different story just outside.

"Those two blue flags to the left, that's the entrance," Gopher said.

That's also where deputies shot and killed 33-year-old Randy Joe Sanders. Gopher's 15-year-old son heard the whole thing.

"It startled him," Gopher said. "So I mean he had an immediate reaction to it."

Neighbors are left in disbelief.

"I mean it's crazy," Gopher said. "It's crazy. Never had any problems in this neighborhood."

Huntsville police responded to conduct a thorough investigation of the events.

Police say a shooting review board will review the events to determine the details early next week
