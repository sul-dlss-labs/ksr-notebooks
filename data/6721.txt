A lawsuit against the Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol over a fatal wreck caused by a man fleeing a trooper in 2007 has been settled for $375,000.

The Mississippi Tort Claims Board recently approved the settlement for the family of 22-year-old Ricky Brown.

Brown, of Mendenhall, was killed and his younger brother, Lamonte Brown, was seriously injured Dec. 1, 2007, when their vehicle was struck by Roderick Evans in Jackson.

Other than confirming that the lawsuit is “finally over,” Jackson lawyer Bob Owens, who represented the family, told The Clarion-Ledger he could not discuss the settlement.

According to the lawsuit, Trooper Julius Hutson was pursuing a car driven by Evans at a high rate of speed on I-220 when the fatal accident occurred.
