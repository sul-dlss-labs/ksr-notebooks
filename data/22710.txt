FAIRLAWN -- Police have identified a man who was fatally shot by a Pulaski County sheriff’s deputy after he assaulted the officer with a knife.

Sergeant Mike Conroy says 70-year-old John Harvey Collins died last night after being shot twice at a mobile home park in Fairlawn.

Conroy says 34-year-old sheriff’s deputy David Cressell encountered Collins after responding to a call of a disturbance at the mobile home park at about 5:20 p.m. yesterday.

Collins had allegedly assaulted two people. Conroy says the deputy confronted Collins, who attacked him with a knife and a blunt object until the deputy shot him.

Conroy says Cressell, who wasn’t injured, has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Virginia State Police are investigating the incident.
