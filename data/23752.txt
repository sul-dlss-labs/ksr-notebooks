Advisory

Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau Detectives are investigating a deputy-involved shooting, which resulted in the death of a male Hispanic adult. The incident occurred on Tuesday, February 06, 2018, at approximately 10:00 p.m., on the 5000 block of East 3rd Street, East Los Angeles.



Detectives have learned that East Los Angeles Station received a call of a male Hispanic adult acting suspiciously in the parking structure of an apartment complex. Deputies arrived at the location and were advised the male Hispanic adult was looking inside vehicles on the lower level of the parking structure.



Once deputies arrived on the lower level of the parking structure, they saw the suspect. The suspect appeared to be trying to hide from the deputies as they exited their vehicle to investigate. When they attempted to contact and detain the suspect, the suspect ran past them and appeared to be running toward the patrol vehicle. Fearing the suspect was attempting to enter the patrol vehicle, one deputy fired the taser at the suspect, which was ineffective. The suspect then entered the patrol vehicle, put it in drive, and drove in the direction of the second deputy, at which time a deputy-involved shooting occurred.



The suspect was struck by gunfire in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene.



No civilian, nor deputies were injured.



The investigation is still ongoing.
