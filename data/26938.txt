PEARSON, Ga. (WALB) - The Georgia Bureau (GBI) is assisting in a fatal officer-involved shooting that happened in Pearson Thursday around 5:30 p.m.

The GBI said it was requested by the Atkinson County Sheriff’s Office to assist with a use of force investigation.

According to the sheriff’s office, an initial report states that Edward Roe, 56, reported to the Atkinson County Sheriff’s Office around 5:15 p.m. While in a restricted area of the sheriff’s office, Roe grabbed a firearm from an office, the report says.

When told by a deputy to put the firearm down, Roe didn’t comply, according to the initial report.

The report says that Roe and the deputy both fired their weapons and Roe was fatally wounded. The deputy was not injured.

The Atkinson County Sheriff’s Office told WALB that Roe was at the office because he was a registered sex offender and was required to spend the trick or treat time on Halloween at the courthouse.

Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the Atkinson County Sheriff’s Office at (912) 422-3611 or the GBI Region 4 office at (912) 389-4103
