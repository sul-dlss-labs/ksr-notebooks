One officer used deadly force during the foot pursuit and the suspect, a 19-year-old male, was struck during the police shooting. Officers rendered medical aid to the suspect before he was pronounced deceased at the scene, Cabrera said. The 19-year-oldâ€™s name was not immediately publicly released.

Officer Ryan Railsback said the suspect also had other people with him during the incident. A second suspect was arrested following a search at a nearby apartment complex on suspicion of vandalism, Cabrera said. That 16-year-old male suspect, with charges pending, was later released to his parents.

No officers were hurt in the incident, Railsback said.
