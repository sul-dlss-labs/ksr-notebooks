A Barstow man was shot to death by a San Bernardino County Sheriff’s deputy during an altercation Thursday night, Nov. 19.

Nathaniel Harris Pickett, 29, was pronounced dead at the scene in the parking lot of the El Rancho Motel at 112 East Main St. in Barstow, according to a Sheriff’s Department news release. The Sheriff’s Department is currently investigating the incident.

The deputy was patrolling Barstow with a citizen volunteer about 9 p.m. when he saw a man, later identified as Pickett, hop a fence into the parking lot of the El Rancho Motel, the news release said.

The deputy stopped to question Pickett, who “gave the deputy a false name and became uncooperative,” the news release said.

When the deputy attempted to handcuff Pickett, he tried to run.

“…almost immediately a fight ensued with the deputy and subject on the ground,” the news release said.

Pickett struck the deputy numerous times in the face and refused to comply with his demands to stop hitting him and move away.

That’s when the deputy fired his weapon, striking Pickett. He died at the scene.

The deputy was transported to a hospital where he was treated for multiple injuries, including broken bones, the news release said.

Court records show Pickett has been convicted twice of resisting arrest.
