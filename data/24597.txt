GREENFIELD - Police have identified the man who died in a June 25 car crash shortly after officers called off their pursuit of him.

The Milwaukee Police Department identified the man as Johnny Stringer, 31, of Milwaukee.

Stringer was the driver of a car that was pulled over by Greenfield police at about 3:15 a.m. June 25 at a gas station along the 4400 block of West Loomis Road. The car sped away when officers approached on foot, according to a report recently released by the Greenfield Police Department.

The car fled east on Layton Avenue, but police quickly ended their pursuit, citing high speeds. Within minutes, however, an officer discovered the vehicle had crashed into a semi-trailer near the intersection of West Layton and South 10th Street, in Milwaukee.

Two witnesses estimated Stringer had been driving between 80 and 100 miles an hour when his car collided with the semi. The car traveled fast enough that it went underneath the trailer and through to the other side, tearing off the roof of the car.

The driver, Stringer, was found dead, according to the report.

An investigation by Milwaukee police is ongoing, the department said, although it is unclear which aspect of the incident is being examined.
