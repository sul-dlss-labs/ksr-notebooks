More details come out about Council Bluffs shooting

More details are emerging about last week’s police shooting of a Nebraska man at a soccer game in Council Bluffs. Authorities say 41-year-old Jose Marcos Santos of Omaha was drunk when he was shot and killed by police last Sunday. An autopsy finds Santos had a blood-alcohol level of nearly point-one-seven. A person is considered drunk in Iowa at point-one. Witnesses say Santos fired a gun at least twice to try and break up a post-game fight. Officers fired 11 shots, five of them hit Santos — and two other people were injured by the gunfire. The Council Bluffs police chief says the number of shots fired by his officers -was- in line with their training. Officials with the state Division of Criminal Investigation expect their probe to take another ten days.
