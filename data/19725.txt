A West Hempfield police sergeant on Tuesday received the township's Medal of Valor for an incident in 2004 when he shot and killed a suspect after a lengthy pursuit.

Also Tuesday, township supervisors presented two officers with life-saving awards and another with a commendation.

"The police department did not have a formal awards program until this past year," Chief Mark Pugliese said. "Now we are able to give our officers the recognition that they deserve."

Sgt. Timothy D. Coyle was honored for an incident on July 20, 2004.

Coyle, then a corporal, was on patrol when he saw a vehicle speeding on Route 30. Coyle tried to stop the vehicle, but the driver, later identified as Johnny Santana, refused to yield.

The high-speed chase ended in Columbia, where Santana abandoned his vehicle and fled on foot.

Coyle and a number of Columbia officers gave chase. When Santana pulled a gun and pointed it at one of the men, Coyle and two Columbia police officers fired a total of seven shots. Santana died shortly thereafter.

"Sergeant Coyle displayed extreme courage, bravery and valor in the line of duty without regard for his own safety, helping to ensure the safety of his fellow officers and the citizens of the community he is sworn to protect," Pugliese stated in a release.

Cpl. Douglas L. Ober and Officer James M. Gardill were presented with a life-saving award for an incident on March 3, 2009, where they kept an unconscious man alive with CPR until emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene.

Sgt. Russell C. Geier received a commendation for a Nov. 3 incident when he rescued a woman and her 2-year-old son from a second-story bedroom, where the woman had barricaded herself after her husband threatened them with a shotgun.
