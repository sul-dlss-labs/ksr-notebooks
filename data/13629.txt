Police say a gunman killed a hostage and then himself to end a standoff with officers at a Family Dollar store in northern Ohio.



Willard police Chief Mark Holden said 19-year-old Shawn Schuett shot one of the women hostages in the head before turning the gun on himself shortly after 8 p.m. Wednesday. The woman died later at a hospital.



Police earlier responded to calls that a man with a rifle had taken over the Family Dollar store and was holding two hostages.



Holden said Schuett, whose motive was unclear, barricaded the front of the store with carts and shelving units. After one hostage managed to escape, officers broke through the front window to find the gunman and hostage shot.



Willard is about 90 miles north of Columbus.
