PORT ST. LUCIE â€” A 50-year-old Port St. Lucie man died after he fell off his bicycle into the path of a police car driven by an officer working overtime during Monday night's eight-hour standoff, officials said.

Norman Eric Stauber was riding a bicycle northbound on the west sidewalk of Bayshore Boulevard about 10:30 p.m. Monday when he rode off the raised curb and fell into the outside lane of Bayshore just before Southwest Swan Avenue, according to a Florida Highway Patrol news release.

Port St. Lucie police Officer Steven Camara, 51, was working overtime to cover shifts for others officers working the unrelated standoff and driving southbound on Bayshore when the right side tires of his 2007 Ford Crown Victoria hit Stauber, according to the release.

Stauber was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the release. He wasn't wearing a helmet.

Camara wasn't injured, according to the release. The cause of the crash remained under investigation Tuesday.

Police Chief John Bolduc said Tuesday he planned to ask Camara if he wanted to take any time off work but wasn't going to make him.

"I didn't put him on any deferred status," Bolduc said. "There's no reason to put him on administrative leave unless he just needs some time to come to grips with the situation. Being involved in a fatal accident is pretty traumatic."
