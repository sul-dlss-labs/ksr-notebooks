A 30-year-old Carbon County man wanted for questioning in the suspicious deaths of two people at Split Rock Resort shot and killed himself Saturday night after a chase in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania State Police said this morning.



They identified the man as Greg Demage, of Jim Thorpe, Pa.



Demage fatally shot himself about 8 p.m. after a car chase and brief standoff along Route 61 in Coal Township, Northumberland County, state police said.



Demage was being sought as a "person of interest" in the deaths of John Carnochan, 77, and Mildred Carnochan, 75, whose bodies were found about noon Saturday in their home on Wolf Hollow Drive in the Split Rock Resort in Kidder Township, Carbon County.



The couple's silver Cadillac DTS was missing, state police said.



Demage was seen driving the vehicle Saturday night in Snydertown, Northumberland County, which sparked the chase, authorities said.



Demage allegedly eluded state troopers, but officers in Ralpho Township spotted him again about 20 minutes later, state police said.



Police stopped the car on Route 61 in Coal Township, which state police said led to a brief standoff before Demage shot himself.



State police in a news release did not comment on how the Carnochans died or Demage's connection to them.



Assisting were police from Shamokin, Coal Township, Kulpmont, Mount Carmel and Mount Carmel Township, state police said, as well as representatives of the Northumberland County sheriff's, district attorney's and coroner's offices.
