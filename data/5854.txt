A Mobile County sheriff's deputy was shot and wounded and a suspect killed today in a car chase during a robbery investigation.

Sergeant Jerry Taylor said 43-year-old Lieutenant Carlos Thompson a 17-year veteran of the department, was shot in Theodore just after three-30 p-m. While investigating a robbery, the deputy spotted the suspect vehicle and gave chase.

The suspect stopped, got out of the vehicle with what Taylor described as an assault rifle, and shot the deputy several times. The injured deputy returned fire, killing the suspect, a 23-year-old Mobile man. Taylor said Thompson was being treated at University of South Alabama Medical Center and was in serious but stable condition this evening.
