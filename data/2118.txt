A man shot to death by police Friday night while trying to run over an officer has been identified as Ruben Zaldivar, 40, who was wanted in connection with threatening his estranged wife, authorities said.

Police traced a series of threatening calls Zaldivar made Friday from a pay phone behind a drugstore in Huntington Beach, said police Sgt. Ron LaVelle.

Officers were summoned to the Old Ranch Town Center in Seal Beach by a report that Zaldivar had been seen there.
