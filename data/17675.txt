MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- Authorities have identified a man who died in a crash early Wednesday morning after a short chase with police in north Minneapolis.

The driver was identified Thursday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office as 29-year-old Antwand Tyreese Cousins of Minneapolis. The Minneapolis Police Department said the crash happened at about 2 a.m. Wednesday at the intersection of Penn and West Broadway Avenues.

Cousins was ejected from the vehicle after it hit another car and crashed into a building. Authorities say a police chase involving Cousins started when he nearly hit a police squad head-on.

Dash camera video shows officers approaching his vehicle and attempting to get him to roll down his window before he refused and fled at a high rate of speed. The chase ended when Cousins hit a minivan at Penn and West Broadway before hitting the building.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, and he died from multiple blunt force injuries associated with the crash.

Sources close to the investigation say Cousins was charged with endangering a child last month in a similar incident. According to court documents, he was involved in a hit-and-run accident and drove backwards down Cedar Avenue to get away from police, all with his 2-year-old child in the back seat.
