William Quiros Jr., a 32-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy Thursday, June 23, in the 12800 block of South Prairie Avenue in Hawthorne, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Deputies were on patrol about 7 p.m. when they spotted Quiros, who authorities said was a known gang member and parolee. They turned their car to talk to him, but he got into a car and refused commands to get out, said Sgt. Diane Hecht.

"Suddenly the suspect got out of the car and began fighting the deputies," Hecht said.

During the struggle, one deputy felt Quirosâ€™ waistband and felt a weapon, according to authorities. At least one deputy then shot Quiros who died at the scene.

A handgun was recovered, authorities said. One deputy who was struck in the face was treated for bruises.
