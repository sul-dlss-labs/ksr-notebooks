ASSARIA (AP) – A 35-year-old central Kansas man is dead after being shot by a sheriff’s deputy who responded to a call from a woman concerned for the safety of her child.

KWCH-TV reports Saline County deputies were called to a rural Assaria home around 8:45 p.m. Tuesday. Sheriff Glen Kochanowski says a deputy talked with Brock Nichols, who apparently had been drinking in violation of a court order.

Kochanowski says Nichols got frustrated while waiting for court documents to get details of the order.

The sheriff says Nichols needed to go to the bathroom and was being escorted by deputies when he went into a dark room. Kochanowski says a deputy shot Nichols after turning on the light and seeing Nichols pointing a semi-automatic handgun at him.
