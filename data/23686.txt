ALTON â€¢ U.S. marshals shot and killed a man who came at them with a knife Friday morning in an Alton home, police say.

The dead man, 42, has not been identified. Police say he was shot to death at about 8:20 a.m. at a home in the 3500 block of Omega Street.

No officers were hurt.

Patrick James, supervisory deputy with the U.S. Marshal Service, said the shooting involved the Eastern Missouri Fugitive Task Force.

The task force went to the home on Omega because the man had violated conditions of his bond. The man had been indicted in a meth case out in the Eastern District of Missouri. On Jan. 18, a district court judge issued an arrest warrant for the man.

The arrest warrant was assigned to the Eastern Missouri task force. They went to Alton to try to arrest him.

"They found him inside the residence, hiding in a closet," James said. "He was in possession of a knife and tried to use the knife against the task force members."

James said the marshals fatally shot him.

James said the shooting will be investigated by the Illinois State Police.
