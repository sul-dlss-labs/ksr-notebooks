PASCAGOULA, Miss. (WLOX) - An investigation is underway after a man died as the result of an officer-involved shooting Wednesday night in Pascagoula.

The victim has been identified as 37-year-old Adam Carroll of Pascagoula.

Officers were responding to a call of a person who was suicidal at 8:16 p.m. on Newman Street when the shooting happened, said Police Chief Matt Chapman.

Officers tried to de-escalate the situation, which involved a man who was armed with a knife. After several commands to put down the weapon, Carroll began approaching officers, said authorities. The Pascagoula officer - who has not been identified - fired his weapon.

Acadian Ambulance was called to the scene, where Carroll was then pronounced dead. His body is being sent for an autopsy at the state crime lab.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, with the assistance of the Jackson County District Attorney’s Office, is investigating the shooting. An investigation is standard procedure any time an officer’s weapon is discharged.
