Phoenix police have identified the officer who shot and killed a Phoenix man during a confrontation at an apartment building Thursday.

Officer Francisco Barrios, 34, a nine-year veteran of the Phoenix Police Department, shot Michael Cisneros, 27, at an east Phoenix apartment complex, police said. Cisneros had confronted officers with a gun, police said.

Per standard protocol, Barrios has been assigned to a "non-enforcement position" for a period of time before returning to patrol, said Phoenix police Sgt. Vince Lewis.

On March 2, officers were called to the Sky Harbor Inn apartments at 2323 E. Van Buren St., shortly before 4:30 p.m. to assist probation officers as they contacted Cisneros, who officials said had violated his probation.

Lewis said Cisneros was a registered sex offender and was on probation for criminal damage and domestic violence.

Police initially contacted management but then saw Cisneros on a second-floor landing. Officers confronted him there and asked him to stop, but he refused to comply and ran from officers. A short distance later, officers surrounded him in a way where he would not be able to escape, Lewis said.

"They made contact with the subject, who was found to be armed with a gun,'' Lewis said. Police wouldn't learn until later that the "gun" was a replica of a semi-automatic pistol, and thus unable to actually fire.

Cisneros refused to listen to officers' commands to drop the "gun" and pointed it at police, Lewis said. Barrios then fired at Cisneros in fear for his own safety, striking him and ending the threat, Lewis said.

"Officers administered first aid until Phoenix Fire arrived," Lewis said.

Cisneros was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, Lewis said. No officers were injured.
