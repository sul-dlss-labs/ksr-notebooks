The GBI has identified the man they say fought with a Walton County deputy and stole his gun before being fatally shot by multiple deputies and officers Thursday afternoon.

William Earnest Brooks, 43, was allegedly riding an ATV outside of a home on Social Circle Fairplay Road, prompting a 911 call that sent deputies to the home, the GBI said in a news release.

The caller said the homeowner expected someone to be there to do some yardwork but not to ride an ATV, the release said. Deputies attempted to talk with Brooks, but he allegedly ran away, prompting a chase.

After the chase, the GBI said Brooks was overpowering the deputy, causing the deputy to draw his weapon and fire one round, missing Brooks.

Brooks then took the weapon and fled deeper into the woods, the release said.

During the search, a Georgia State Patrol helicopter spotted Brooks near a lake shoreline with his weapon brandished, the release said.

Multiple Walton County deputies and one Social Circle police officer then fired at Brooks, who died at the scene, the release said. Channel 2 Action News reported that six Walton County deputies fired shots.

The deputy who was overpowered by Brooks was taken to a local hospital and treated for minor injuries, the release said.

The GBI was called in to investigate after the incident.
