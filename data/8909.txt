A man died in a fiery crash early today in Plainfield when the stolen Chevrolet Tahoe he was driving crashed as he fled from a suspected burglary, Plainfield police said.

An officer, responding to a liquor store burglar alarm on the 16200 block of Lincoln Highway, saw broken glass in front of the business and the Tahoe nearby about 2 a.m., Police Chief Bill Doster said.

The officer approached the Tahoe, which pulled away and headed south on Lily Cache Road. The officer initially chased the vehicle but "terminated pursuit due to the high rate of speed and dangerous road conditions," Doster said.

The officer eventually caught up with the burning vehicle, which had crashed into several trees on the east side of the road on Lily Cache Road south of Lincoln Highway, police said.

The Tahoe had turned over and then caught fire after hitting the trees, according to the Will County coroner's office.

Plainfield Fire Department personnel extracted the driver, who was dead, Doster said.

The vehicle was reported stolen out of Plainfield this week, Doster said.

Identification of the driver is being withheld pending positive identification and notification of family, according to the coroner's office.

Illinois State Police were investigating the crash.
