A McAlester man died after an officer-involved shooting Sunday morning about 20 miles north of Enid in Grant County.

Clifford Butler Jr., of McAlester, was fatally shot after police say he pulled a gun and shot an officer at least once after authorities tried to subdue him, according to an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation news release.

Pond Creek police received a call from homeowners around 6 a.m. about a man trying to get inside their house, located at 18533 U.S. 81, according to the release.

The Pond Creek police chief, a Grant County sheriff’s deputy and two Medford police officers responded to the call and made contact with the man once they arrived at the scene.

Butler, 67, was “acting erratic” and reportedly told officers people in the bushes were trying to harm him, the OSBI said.

When officers tried to subdue him, he allegedly pulled a gun and shot Pond Creek Police Chief Tim Barwick, according to the report. Barwick was transported to an Enid hospital.

The Grant County sheriff’s deputy returned fire, killing Butler.

The OSBI is investigating whether the shooting was justified.

OSBI will not release the name of the Grant County sheriff deputy unless the deputy is arrested or charge with the crime, according to the release.
