ONTARIO >> The Inland Valley teenager who robbed an Ontario fast-food restaurant Thursday and threatened passers-by with a gun from his skateboard until he was fatally shot in a confrontation with officers was identified Friday.

Police identified the teen as Raul Herrera III, 17, of Ontario. He was pronounced dead at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Ontario a short time after Thursday’s confrontation.

A suicide note was found at Herrera’s home after the afternoon shooting, Ontario police Sgt. Jeff Higbee said Friday.

“It’s still under investigation, but we believe this to be a case of ‘suicide by cop’ based on the suicide note found at the boy’s home and some of his actions,” he said.

For instance, just after Herrera robbed the Jack in the Box at Archibald Avenue and Riverside Drive, he handed out stolen cash to customers before leaving on his skateboard, Higbee said.

“He just did something to get police to respond down there,” he said.

Higbee said officers responded to numerous 9-1-1 reports of a skateboarding teen pointing a gun at people and cars while repeatedly screaming, “I got a gun!”

When officers confronted him a block from the restaurant, Herrera pointed his gun at them and they fired on him, Higbee said.

He said the teen was carrying a .38-caliber Smith and Wesson revolver, but did not know if the weapon was loaded.

Higbee called Herrera’s death horrible and said that the officers who fired on him now have to cope with what happened.

“They had no idea how old the suspect was until after the whole thing was over,” he said.

Herrera lived at home with his parents, Higbee said.
