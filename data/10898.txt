Robert La Rue, a 48-year-old white man, was fatally shot by sheriffâ€™s deputies Tuesday, Dec. 27, in the 29300 block of Golden Meadow Drive in Rancho Palos Verdes, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Deputies responded to a home after reports that La Rue had assaulted his 85-year-old father.

The son called the Sheriff's Department and warned that he had a high-powered rifle and handgun, and then repeated the threat to the responding deputies, said sheriff's Capt. Mike Parker.

La Rue refused to cooperate with the deputies and then took up a shooting stance with a metal object, leading deputies to shoot him for their own protection, Parker said. The metal object recovered next to La Rue was a knife, Parker said.

La Rue was pronounced dead at the scene. Coroner's records show he sustained two gunshot wounds to the chest and superficial cuts to his right lower inner forearm.

The sheriff's homicide bureau, the district attorney's office and other agencies are investigating the incident, which is standard in deputy-involved shootings.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters who would like to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800) 222-8477.
