WEST COVINA — Authorities today identified a man who was killed in a deputy-involved shooting in an unincorporated area near West Covina.

No deputies were injured in the shooting, which happened around 5 p.m. Thursday in the 19100 block of Elberland Street, said Deputy Irys Alvarez of the Sheriff’s Headquarters Bureau.

The dead man was 35-year-old Javier Mendez, whose city of residence was not known, said coroner’s Assistant Chief Ed Winter.

Deputy Aura Sierra, also of SHB, said Mendez has been wanted in connection with a home-invasion robbery, which was reported in Walnut near Lemon Avenue and Amar Road.

Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau Lt. Steve Jauch told reporters at the scene a man in the home reported the suspect had been inside the residence, demanding money from his mother.

Jauch said that as deputies arrived at the scene, a black compact sedan driven by the suspect sped toward them.

Jauch said the pursuit led deputies to the parking lot of the Bestway Supermarket in the 19000 block of La Puente Road and ran through the market.

Jauch said the suspect ran east through neighborhood backyards before encountering deputies at a residence on the corner of Elberland Street and Abelian Avenue.

A witness, Eugenia Montiel, told the San Gabriel Valley Tribune the suspect was shirtless as he walked out of a backyard before being chased back into it by deputies.

Audio from broadcast footage revealed a barrage of shots in rapid succession. Jauch said more than one deputy was involved in the shooting of the suspect.

He said a woman and a child were in the suspect’s vehicle. Their relationship to the suspect was not known.

Jauch told the Tribune no weapon had been found at or near the scene.
