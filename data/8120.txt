Man Shot By Atmore Police Dies

The man shot by Atmore Police early Sunday morning in Walnut Hill has died, according to friends and family members.

Danny Ray Williams, 33, passed away Monday evening at the USA Medical Center in Mobile. Hospital officials confirm that Williams is no longer a patient at their facility, and Atmore Police have also confirmed the death.

Atmore Police say they chased Williams out of Atmore and into Florida about 1:30 Sunday morning after he was seen speeding away from an Atmore neighborhood where police had just received a call of shots fired.

Glenn Carlee, Atmore’s director of public safety, says Williams apparently tried to hit an Atmore Police Department cruiser head-on. Once he stopped and officers approached the car with weapons drawn, Carlee says Williams accelerated toward an officer in an attempt to hit him. That prompted at least two officers to fire at Williams.

Florida authories told NorthEscambia.com Sunday morning at the scene that Williams had been shot at least once in the head.
