OAKLAND (CBS SF) - Oakland police have released the name of a driver shot and killed by a California Highway Patrol officer early Tuesday morning.

The pursuit began shortly before 3 a.m. after two CHP officers attempted to stop a silver BMW SUV without license plates on Interstate Highway 580 near High Street, according to CHP Officer Daniel Hill.

The driver failed to yield and sped away from the officers, prompting a pursuit through city streets. The chase ended in a cul-de-sac in the 5700 block of East 15th Street where the driver crashed into two parked cars and jumped out of the BMW, Hill said.

Hill said the driver, later identified as Mestas, then approached the two officers with a firearm in his hand, prompting them to shoot him.

The officers attempted to administer CPR to Mestas, who was pronounced dead a short time later by emergency responders, according to Hill.

Hill said the shooting is being investigated jointly by Oakland police, the Alameda County District Attorney's Office and the CHP.
