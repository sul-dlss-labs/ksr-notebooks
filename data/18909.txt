Daequann Buckner.

Harrisburg Police Chief Thomas Carter called a Saturday afternoon standoff that ended in suicide "a tragedy".

Carter said that his department had been working with the family of the victim, Daequann Buckner, to convince him to turn himself in to police after he became a suspect in a double shooting in Harrisburg last week.

"For some reason, Daequann, he was scared, he was nervous," Carter said. "And he was trying to get enough nerve to surrender to us."

Harrisburg police got information that Buckner was at a house on the 2300 block of Berryhill Street on Saturday. Around 12:30 p.m. officers visited the residence but Buckner refused to leave the basement.

Police then heard several gunshots, causing them to retreat and call in the department's Crisis Response Team.

At an undetermined time, the team sent in a robot to the basement and discovered Buckner had committed suicide.

Carter, speaking outside the home, said the incident was deeply saddening.

"I know Daequann's family, he comes from a really good family. He's also a really nice kid, I also know him," Carter said. "I don't understand what went wrong. I just wish that he would have surrendered to us - his family, they were working hard to have that happen."

Carter said Buckner may have been listening to the wrong people rather than those who loved him.

"It's a tragedy," Carter said. "It's a tragedy."
