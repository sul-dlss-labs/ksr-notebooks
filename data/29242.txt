Four people died in a crash this week in west suburban Berkeley after the driver attempted to evade police, authorities said Thursday.

About 11 p.m. Monday an officer with the Berkeley Police Department saw a vehicle parked in an alley behind a retail plaza at 5555 St. Charles Road, according to Chief Tim Larem. It wasn’t immediately clear what type of vehicle it was, but Larem said its lights were off and no license plate was visible.

The officer tried to conduct a traffic stop, but the driver “fled the scene” at high speed, Larem wrote in an email. At the intersection of Bohlander and Taft avenues, the driver missed or ignored a stop sign and as it moved into the intersection, the car was hit by a semitrailer, Larem said.

The driver and three people who were in the car died from injuries they suffered in the collision, Larem said. The driver of the semi was not injured, Larem said.

The Cook County medical examiner’s office had not released the names of the deceased as of Thursday.
