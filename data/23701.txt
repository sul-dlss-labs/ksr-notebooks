Investigators said Mirrielees handcuffed Cobb, and while he was handcuffed, investigators believe Cobb was able to retrieve a hidden hand gun and fired at deputies. The deputies and the other male resident ran frm the bedroom and headed toward the stairs.

Investigators said Cobb then went into a bathroom and fatally shot himself. Lerma reached the bottom area of the staircase and turned back toward the stairs with his gun drawn and fired several times, hitting the other male resident multiple times.

Mierrielees was also wounded inside the home. Investigators are still waiting on results of ballistic and DNA testing to confirm these preliminary indications, Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said in his press release. This testing is also being performed to determine the source of the injuries sustained by Mirrielees. Both Mirrielees and the other male resident survived and have been released from the hospital. Cobb's ex-wife, who was held captive for a short time, was unharmed.
