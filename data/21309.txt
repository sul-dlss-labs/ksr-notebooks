GEORGETOWN TOWNSHIP -- Police have identified the driver of a motorcycle who died after crashing into a house, moments after fleeing a police officer, as Kevin Allen Dawson, 44, of Hudsonville.

The Harley Davidson motorcycle that Dawson was driving went off Port Sheldon Street near 36th Avenue shortly after cresting a hill. The bike hit a house and Dawson was pronounced dead at the scene.

Ottawa County sheriff's deputies said the pursuit involving Dawson began at about 8:20 p.m. when a deputy tried to stop his bike on Balsam Drive for excessive speed.

Police said Dawson did not stop, but cut through several parking lots and exited onto Port Sheldon Street. He then drove west at high speed, losing control as he crested a small hill near 36th Avenue.

The distance between Dawson's bike and the pursuing police cruiser was not immediately clear, or why Dawson fled the traffic stop.
