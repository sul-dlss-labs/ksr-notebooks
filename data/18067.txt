COUNCE, Tenn. — Danny Pirtle of Hardin County has been identified as the man killed in a Monday shootout with U.S. marshals in Counce.

Pirtle, 42, had a long history of drug and theft charges, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. Marshals were assisting the Hardin County Sheriff's Office in serving a capias warrant when Pirtle shot at police, the TBI said.

Counce is near Pickwick Lake, about 115 miles east of Memphis.

Leslie Earhart, spokeswoman for the TBI, said Pirtle shot at marshals while they tried to arrest him near Blackberry Way, and marshals returned fire. Pirtle later died from his injuries.

Police said two other men were arrested in the incident after a car chase. Earhart said the TBI is only investigating the officer-involved shooting, but not the car chase, and charges against the other two men were not immediately available.

Hardin County Sheriff Sammy Davidson could not be reached for comment Wednesday, but he told The (Hardin County) Courier newspaper that the initial warrant against Pirtle was for failure to appear in court to face a drug charge.

Jessica Hunt, a friend of Pirtle's, said Pirtle's friends want answers to why he was shot.

"He did fire a couple shots, but they gunned him down at the lake," Hunt said. "We don't know how it happened or why it happened."

The TBI has not confirmed how many times Pirtle was shot or how many times he fired at police. Records show Pirtle has a criminal history that includes theft, drug charges, evading and resisting arrest, weapons charges, and driving charges beginning in 1999. His most recent charge came in December 2015 for theft of a motor vehicle, sale of methamphetamine, resisting arrest, and evading arrest.

Court documents also show that Pirtle had charges in April on introduction of contraband to a penal facility after he was accused of attempting to sneak suboxone strips into the jail in a Bible a friend brought to him.
