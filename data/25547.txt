PROSSER, Wash. (AP) â€” Authorities say a 56-year-old man died after police used a Taser to stun him during his arrest following a car chase and standoff west of Richland.

The Benton County Sheriff's Office said on Facebook that the Grandview man fled Monday in a stolen vehicle from a Washington State Patrol trooper who tried to stop him for speeding.

The sheriff's office says multiple officers pursued the man who was seen with a pistol before he stopped the vehicle near Prosser.

Authorities negotiated with the man for several hours and the sheriff's office says he became combative during arrest and a Taser was used. A few minutes later he stopped breathing and CPR efforts were unsuccessful.

Inside the vehicle officers found pills, a meth pipe, other drug paraphernalia, and the pistol.

A special investigations unit is investigating.
