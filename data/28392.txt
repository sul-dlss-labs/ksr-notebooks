A Belton woman was fatally injured in a two-vehicle collision that occurred in Cass County Tuesday afternoon during a police chase.

According to the Missouri State Highway Patrol, 37-year-old Sarah H. Hundley of Belton was the driver of a 2007 Chrysler Aspen being pursued by Cass County deputies, who believed the vehicle she was driving was stolen.

The chase began on I-49 around noon and ended nearly 15 miles later in rural Peculiar on Route J.

According to the report, the SUV struck a northbound 2017 Toyota Rav 4 driven by 53-year-old Michael D. Smuder of Peculiar. The Toyota had stopped, waiting to turn left at County Road 203. The Chrysler struck left side of the Toyota as it was making a left turn and spun it around. The Chrysler then overturned and Huneley was ejected.

Hundley was pronounced dead at the scene by Medical Examiner Jordan Rias at 12:47 p.m. She was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash. The body was taken by the coroner to Forensic Medical Center of Kansas.

Smuder and a 16-year-old female juvenile suffered minor injuries and were transported to Belton Regional Medical Center.

Casss County deputies assisted the six Troopers at the scene.
