One of two people killed in a crash earlier this week in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood after a California Highway Patrol chase has been identified, according to the San Francisco medical examiner’s office.

Deaudry Carr, 43, who has no fixed address, was killed after a CHP chase early Wednesday from Oakland that ended on San Francisco’s Fifth Street off-ramp from westbound I-80.

CHP officers first spotted a BMW stolen out of San Francisco on northbound Interstate Highway 880 near Seventh Street in Oakland around 3 a.m., according to the CHP.

When the CHP tried to stop the car, the driver of the BMW led officers on a chase from Oakland to westbound I-80.

The BMW continued on to the Bay Bridge and the driver accelerated to speeds of more than 100 mph, according to the CHP.

The BMW driver exited at the Fifth Street off-ramp in San Francisco, where the driver crashed into a ramp wall and the car caught on fire.

A man was ejected from the car and killed, while the other occupant was killed inside the car, according to Wilkenfeld.

One of the people killed in the incident was Carr, while the other person has yet to be identified, according to the medical examiner’s office.
