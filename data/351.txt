The raid came at the end of a series of undercover sting operations in which agents bought cocaine from the house at 312 Stockton St., police said.

Authorities say officers knocked, were invited in and then a man came around a corner with a handgun and opened fire.

No officers were injured. Police would not say whether drugs were seized.

Conflicting stories on Saturday arose from neighbors in this town about 15 miles southwest of Greeley.

Several said they saw police carry a battering ram up to the house and conduct a no-knock drug raid.

"They were undercover. They came in, in unmarked vehicles, and I heard the police ramming the door," said Joy Jay, who lives near the home. "Then there were gunshots. It was like the show "Cops.'"

Another neighbor, who didn't want to be named, said the man who was killed was visually impaired and the injured woman was pregnant.

"They were nice to us," she said. "My son is friends with the boy there, and he said the guy is blind. It was a sad situation. I think the lady living there was helping him out with the cleaning and stuff." The small white house was guarded and blocked off by police tape. The door stood open, and furniture inside was turned upside down.

The woman who was shot in the buttocks remains at North Colorado Medical Center in stable condition, police said.

Police are withholding her name because she still needed to be questioned, said Margie Martinez, spokeswoman for Weld County Sheriff's Office.

The woman was not a suspect.

The house at 312 Stockton St. is owned by Leonardo Quintana, according to property records.

"I'm actually glad they're out of the neighborhood," Jay said. "Shady people are always driving by, looking at the house."
