KEARNEYSVILLE, W.Va. — A 55-year-old man was killed by police Thursday in Jefferson County, W.Va., after repeatedly shooting a gun and then pointing the weapon in the direction of officers who had responded to a call about the shooting, police said.

Officers from multiple law-enforcement agencies responded to the Fox Glen area of Kearneysville to investigate a report of a male discharging a firearm at 3:50 p.m. in the 100 block of Jophpurs Road, according to the West Virginia State Police.

Upon arriving, officers encountered the male clinging to an antenna pole in front of a Jophpurs Road residence and waving a firearm, police said in a news release Friday.

After communications with the man were “to no avail,” he pointed a firearm in the direction of officers; the officers then discharged their firearms, striking the male, the news release from West Virginia State Police First Sgt. J.D. Burkhart states.

The man fell from the antenna pole and succumbed to his injuries; he was pronounced deceased at the scene, police said.

The West Virginia State Police Crime Scene Response Team responded to process the scene and will conduct the investigation, which is ongoing, police said.

Jefferson County Sheriff Pete Dougherty said Thursday evening that the man pointed and shot his gun “in a way that appeared to be a direct threat to law enforcement.”

Doughterty had said the man had shot previously, but not at anyone.

The man recently received bad medical news, which appeared to be the cause of his distress, Dougherty said.

Dougherty initially said there was no indication the man would hurt others, but residents of the area were advised to stay indoors.

He said authorities and the man’s family and friends tried to talk to him and deescalate the situation.
