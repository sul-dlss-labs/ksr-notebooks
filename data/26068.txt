PORTSMOUTH

Police have charged an 18-year-old from Suffolk in connection with a fatal crash at the Midtown Tunnel in April.

Demonta M. Johnson faces four counts — felony homicide, eluding, hit and run causing death, and hit and run causing property damage — in the April 23 death of 41-year-old Kevin Joyner, Portsmouth police said in a news release Thursday.

Shortly before 5 p.m. April 23, Chesapeake police tried to stop a vehicle for traffic infractions, but the driver — identified by police as Johnson — didn’t stop, police said at the time. A pursuit into Norfolk and Portsmouth followed.

As the vehicle approached the Midtown Tunnel, it struck Joyner’s motorcycle from behind, according to police. He died at the scene.

Chesapeake police said the vehicle kept going, and just before going into the tunnel, the driver and two passengers got out.

Police arrested the two passengers — identified as 19-year-old Deamon Richardson and 22-year-old Kei-Airra King — but the driver was picked up by another vehicle and initially evaded arrest, Chesapeake police said.

Johnson was subsequently arrested and charged in Chesapeake on numerous counts related to the incident.

Online court records show Richardson was found guilty in May of possessing marijuana, and an obstruction charge was dismissed. An obstruction charge against King was dropped earlier this month, online court records show.

Johnson is being held in the Chesapeake city jail.
