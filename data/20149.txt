A 22-year-old Beloit driver died early Sunday after he fled from police, hit another vehicle and crashed into a pole, Beloit police reported.

The man's passenger, a 22-year-old Beloit woman, was critically injured, while two people in the other vehicle suffered no injuries.

An officer attempted to stop the man's vehicle on Fourth St., just south of Portland Ave., about 2 a.m. Sunday, according to a news release. The vehicle turned westbound onto Roosevelt Ave. and sped away.

Per department policy, no chase was initiated because the attempted stop was only for speeding, police said.

The Beloit man's vehicle failed to stop at a stop sign at Bluff St. and struck a vehicle that was traveling northbound on Bluff. The man's vehicle then hit a utility pole. The vehicle was cut in half, and he and his passenger were ejected.
