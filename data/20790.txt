PITTSBURGH (KDKA) - Charges could soon be filed against the driver accused of causing a fatal accident in Penn Hills over the weekend.

According to police, 25-year-old Kayla Johnson-Ukeyne was killed when she was hit by a speeding driver Saturday evening.

Initially, it was believed the suspect was leading police on a chase. However, that may not be the case.

According to sources close to the investigation, 28-year-old Kayla Hoffman was driving erratically at a high-rate of speed near Verona and Frankstown Roads, when she passed a Penn Hills Police unit heading the other way.

Penn Hills Police Chief Howard Burton said his officer turned on the lights and turned around to try to pull over Hoffman's SUV. However, the New Castle woman was already a quarter of a mile ahead and stopped.

"He sees a car, the SUV, come through a red light towards him off of Robinson Boulevard and down Verona Road," Burton said.

"The officer activated his red lights, made a turn in the intersection, had the lights on to prevent any injuries to anybody else, and he started down Verona Road and in an attempt to stop this vehicle.

"He could not catch up to the vehicle and when he finally did, the crash already occurred."

According to police, Hoffman slammed head on into a Ford Taurus being driven by Johnson-Ukeyne, who was later pronounced dead at the scene.

Hoffman was taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital with two broken legs and was in serious condition.

Her passenger, a woman identified by police as Tomarro Wade, 42, of New Kensington, was also taken to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital. She was last listed in serious condition.

Hoffman will could be charged with homicide by motor vehicle, involuntary manslaughter, reckless endangerment and fleeing and eluding police.

She has violated her probation and has an extensive criminal history, which includes drugs and prostitution.
