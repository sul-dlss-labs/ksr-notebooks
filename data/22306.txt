A man was killed during a gunfight with a railroad police officer late Sunday afternoon in front of the New Albany Police Department.

Officials did not release the man's identity Sunday night, or that of the railroad officer.

Capt. Keith Whitlow, chief of detectives for the New Albany Police Department, said there was an exchange of gunfire between the man and a Norfolk Southern Railroad police officer. He said there was more than one shot fired, but he refused to give details regarding the incident, saying the investigation is still under way.

"There is still a lot of investigating to do, and we don't want to make any premature statements," he said.

The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m., he said, adding that an autopsy is scheduled for this morning.

Yellow police tape blocked off the downtown intersection of Scribner Drive and Spring Street, where detectives set up at least five small evidence markers in the middle of the intersection.

Indiana State Police Trooper John Cleveland, who was assisting with traffic control, said he heard that the gunman was driving a white sport utility vehicle on Scribner Drive, then got out of the vehicle and fired two shots into it. Cleveland said the man then began walking and shooting randomly at other targets â€” "cars, people, anything."

That is when the officer for the railroad arrived, and a gunfight followed, Cleveland said.

As investigators worked the scene, the ramp to I-64 was blocked, rerouting traffic until late into the evening.
