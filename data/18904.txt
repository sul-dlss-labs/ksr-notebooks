A man suspected of stealing a vehicle from a Vancouver-area driveway Friday morning was killed in an officer-involved shooting a few blocks away.

The incident began at about 6:20 a.m. when the man, whose name has not been released, confronted the owner of a vehicle at 5804 N.E. 41st Circle, in the Roads End neighborhood north of Highway 500 and west of Northeast Andresen Road.

The man climbed into the car, a 2014 Honda Accord, and rammed it into the garage before fleeing, according to emergency radio traffic monitored by The Columbian.

The person who called 911 to report the car theft reportedly fired a gun into the air, according to emergency radio traffic.

Neighbor Norese Massenburg said he awoke upon hearing the gunshots. When he investigated, he learned that his neighbor had been trying to prevent the theft.
