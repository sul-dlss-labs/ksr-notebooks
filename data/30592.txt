DADE CITY — A man fired at deputies during a two-hour standoff and then fatally shot himself, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies were trying to locate Lewis Moores, 50, about 9:50 a.m. near the intersection of State Road 52 and Smith Road to arrest him on outstanding warrants, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Two deputies asked him to come out of a home peacefully. After about 10 minutes, the Moores fired shots at the deputies, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Moores continued to fire as the deputies sought cover. One of the deputies returned fire.

For about two hours, Moores spoke with deputies and refused to come out of the home while periodically firing more shots, according to the Sheriff’s Office. Moores then shot himself and died at the scene.

No deputies were injured.

The Sheriff’s Office released a 2½ minute body camera video that deputies shows the moment Moores first opened fire as a deputy wearing the camera sat in his patrol sport utility vehicle. The video shows the deputy returning fire and taking cover behind the SUV.

“Shots came out the window toward my vehicle. We’ve returned fire,” the deputy can be heard saying into his radio.

The Sheriff’s Office has not released the name of the deputies involved in the incident.
