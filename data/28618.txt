A San Bernardino man was fatally shot by police when, officers said, he pointed a handgun at them for the second time.

Santos Anthony Villegas, 36, was being sought by police on Monday, Aug. 17, and had two encounters with officers in which he leveled the pistol at them, San Bernardino Police Sgt. John Echevarria said in a statement.

Villegas was stopped just before 3:30 p.m. at 11th and G streets in the city by a patrol officer. He had just exited a white Ford Expedition, and was “acting suspicious,” Echevarria said.

Villegas had been involved in an earlier incident and might have been armed, police said, without providing more details.

When told to stop, police said, Villegas turned and pointed a handgun at the officer and pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire.

He escaped on foot, hiding in a nearby yard in the area of 700 Orange Street, Echevarria said. Police found him, they said, and again he aimed the handgun, this time at more than one officer, and he was shot, Echevarria said.

Four officers fired their weapons during the incident, Echevarria said. Villegas was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police recovered a green, .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun from the scene of the shooting, Echevarria said. It was loaded, and had been reported stolen in Hemet.

Police released photos from a body-worn camera, which they said showed Villegas pointing the recovered firearm at the officers.
