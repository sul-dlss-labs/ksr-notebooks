LAGRANGE, Maine — A Maine State Police trooper shot and killed a 49-year-old man during a lengthy standoff in LaGrange Sunday night, according to Maine Department of Public Safety spokesman Stephen McCausland.

McCausland identified the man as Lewis Conlogue of LaGrange. The shooting occurred near 5572 Bennoch Road. Conlogue was armed and held police at bay for about 3 hours outside the former Highland Farm restaurant along Route 16, through McCausland didn’t say what weapon he was armed with. Conlogue died on scene.

Sgt. Scott Hamilton, the trooper who shot Conlogue, has been placed on paid administrative leave while the Attorney General’s Office investigates, which is standard procedure in any police-involved shooting.

The standoff ended shortly after 7 p.m., according to McCausland. A stretch of Route 16 through LaGrange was still closed to traffic as of 9 p.m. Sunday night.

Penobscot County sheriff’s deputies and Maine State Police responded to a reported domestic incident around 4 p.m. involving a man with a weapon.

He refused to cooperate and threatened violence if anyone approached, Sheriff Glenn Ross said earlier during the standoff. McCausland said state police negotiators were called to the scene.

Route 16, also known as Bennoch Road, was closed from the intersection with South LaGrange Road to the intersection with Route 155 while police dealt with the standoff, according to firefighters who had the road blocked off.
