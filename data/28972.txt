LOUDONVILLE — An Elyria man who led authorities on a chase from a Mohican campground into Loudonville Saturday night died after committing suicide, according to the preliminary findings of a law-enforcement investigation.

The results, announced in a Loudonville Police press release, reported shots were fired by both an officer and the now deceased suspect at the intersection of North Market and Campbell Streets in Loudonville. But authorities say it appears the officer’s shot did not strike the suspect. Rather, Joseph Stanley, 29, of Elyria, died by suicide.

This is consistent with officers’ observations at the scene, the release continued. The Loudonville Police Department (LPD) asked the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigations to conduct an independent investigation of the incident, which remains ongoing.

At 6:41 p.m. Saturday, Oct. 17, officers from multiple agencies responded to a 911 call regarding a domestic dispute at Mohican Reservation Campground. While en route, officers were informed the suspect had set fire to a tent, was shooting at people and attempting to leave the scene, possibly with a child.

Police say Stanley fled the campground with the child as two officers arrived, one from the LPD and the other from Mohican State Park. The child was unharmed.

The vehicular chase ended at the intersection of North Market and Campbell Streets, at which point Stanley exited the vehicle with a handgun, according to the LPD. Stanley was later pronounced dead by Loudonville EMS. No officers were injured during the incident.

Deputies from Holmes and Knox County were also dispatched to the campground, and an Ashland County Sheriff’s Office deputy became involved during the pursuit.
