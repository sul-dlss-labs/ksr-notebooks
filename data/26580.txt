Phoenix police identified the man who was killed by an officer Monday evening after attacking his mother with a knife as 47-year-old Hector Miranda.

Police encountered Miranda during a domestic disturbance call late Monday afternoon in the 4300 block of West Dailey Street, just north of 43rd Avenue and Thunderbird Road, according to a Phoenix police news release.

A 911 caller reported the incident on behalf of Miranda’s mother, a neighbor, who fled to her home after her son attacked her, the release stated. The caller’s husband took Miranda’s mother to the hospital, where she was treated for a deep head wound and released later that evening.

Police arriving on scene learned from the 911 caller that Miranda was armed. He approached two officers, wielding a handgun and long knife, and ignored their orders for him to drop his weapons, according to the Phoenix police news release.

“Miranda made statements that he intended to force officers into shooting him,” according to the news release. Miranda pointed his handgun toward each of the two responding police officers, prompting them to shoot and kill him.

Three shots were fired by officers, according to the news release. Both officers involved were wearing functioning body cameras, Phoenix police Sgt Vince Lewis said.

The two officers involved have not been identified by name, but they are both 22-year-old males with less than two years’ experience, according to police.
