A little after 5 a.m. Thursday, Federicco Londono woke up to the sound of gun shots in his Town N’ Country neighborhood.

“Just about 5 in the morning, we hear like about five shots and after that we get out to the front of the house and we saw three people walking about,” said Federico.

Samantha Stevens also heard the shots and rushed outside.

“I saw a woman coming out of the car, running to our neighbors house that’s right up there and then that’s when I saw the man walking back in the direction of the house that he ended up in,” said Stevens.

The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s office says Michel “Frenchy” Barbeau, 47, shot two women and then barricaded himself into his home at 6731 Ranger Drive.

The victims were taken to a local hospital and are now in stable condition.

“Our negotiators made every attempt, they talked to this individual for five hours today to try to get him to surrender hisself,” said Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office Chief Deputy Donna Lusczynski.

The sheriff’s office says Barbeau broke off negotiations around 12:30 p.m. and would not respond to phone calls.

At that time they sent a robot into the home and found Barbeau dead inside from a self inflicted wound.

“It’s really, really sad and it’s sad it had to end this way. We were hoping it would just come out and it would be the end,” said Stevens.
