MORGAN PARK â€” A 23-year-old man was shot and killed after he pointed a handgun at police outside his Morgan Park home Saturday night, authorities said.

Kenneth R. Dukes of the 10000 block of South Hermosa Avenue died of multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday, said the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Police spokesman Patrick Camden said Morgan Park Police District officers patrolling the neighborhood heard gunshots fired on the 10000 block of South Hermosa. They found two cars parked side by side in the street. Dukes jumped from the passenger's seat of one of the cars and ran between his home and the one next door, Camden said.

Dukes was told to stop, but he turned and aimed a handgun at a 27-year-old officer who has been on the force for four years, Camden said. The officer fired several shots at Dukes, Camden said. Police recovered a 9 mm handgun, he said.

However, Dukes' brother Jonathan Whitlow, 38, said family members were told by witnesses that Dukes was unarmed and shot in the back by police.

Police denied the accusations.
