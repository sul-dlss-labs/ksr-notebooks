A slaying suspect was killed when police shot him after a car chase that ended Sunday morning in Hemet, when the 30-year-old man got out of the car he was driving with a gun in his hand, police said.

The San Jacinto man, who was not further identified, was being sought in the death of a 29-year-old man found bleeding from a head wound at 9:30 p.m. Saturday night in the 1000 block of North Buena Vista Street in Hemet, Police Lt. Nathan Miller said.

Police had been called to the area on reports of gunfire and a wounded man. He was taken to Hemet Valley Medical Center and died a short time later, police said. He was not fully identified Sunday, awaiting notification of relatives.

Investigators identified a suspect after interviews and collecting evidence, Miller said. He was spotted about 6 a.m. Sunday in the 400 block of N. Palm Avenue in Hemet, and fled in his car when officers tried to stop him. The chase went into neighboring San Jacinto, then back into Hemet, Miller said.

The suspect’s car stopped in the 500 block of North San Jacinto Street and the man came out with a gun in his hand, and was shot by police, Miller said. Medical aid was called, and the man died at the scene.

No officers were injured.

Hemet Police detectives are investigating the Saturday night slaying, while the Riverside County District Attorney’s Bureau of Investigation will examine the Sunday police shooting.
