Navajo Nation police say a man threw a rock at a unit and was believed to have threatened officers with a weapon before officers shot and killed him in Fort Defiance on Tuesday.

The shooting occurred at about 11 a.m. near milepost 29 on Route 12, according to a Facebook post from the Navajo Police Department. It's unclear why police initially responded to the area.

Before the shooting, an officer told dispatch the man threw a rock at a police unit and they were going to make contact with him, the department said.

Another officer then arrived at the scene, according to the department.

Police say the man was believed to have a weapon and threatened the officers. It's unclear if police later recovered a weapon.

They used a Taser on the man but when it "did not have an effect" on him the officers discharged their weapons, the department said. It's unclear how many times the man was shot or by whom.

The man was taken to a hospital, where he later died from his injuries, according to the department. His identity was not released by police as of Wednesday afternoon.

The officers were also not identified by the department.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation in Phoenix was investigating the shooting.
