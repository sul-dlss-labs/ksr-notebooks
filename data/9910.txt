A California Highway Patrol officer was legally justified in fatally shooting a despondent 53-year-old Wrightwood man who opened fire on officers sent to check on him, San Bernardino County prosecutors announced Thursday.

Jeffrey Street died Feb. 27 of a bullet wound to the head, an autopsy determined. Five loaded guns — a revolver, two rifles and two shotguns — were found near his body.

“Street put into motion this (fatal) series of events by telling his wife that he was suicidal,” Lead Deputy District Attorney Reid L. Robsahm wrote in a four-page analysis of the shooting case. “Out of concern for her husband, (she) notified the authorities.

“When contacted (by a deputy sheriff and two CHP officers), Mr. Street was holding a handgun and ignored multiple commands by the deputy to put the weapon down.”

Street then grabbed a rifle and began shooting at the officers, Robsahm wrote.

After the second shot, CHP Officer Andrew Howell returned fire with his department-issued AR-15 rifle, according to the district attorney’s office document.

“Officer Howell’s use of deadly force was justified under the laws of self-defense and the defense of others, and no criminal liability attaches to the conduct,” Robsahm concluded.
