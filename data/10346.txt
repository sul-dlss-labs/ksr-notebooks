EAST ST. LOUIS â€¢ A police chase from Brooklyn into East St. Louis lasted only a few minutes early Wednesday but had a deadly outcome.

The suspect's car crashed on St. Clair Avenue, west of North 17th Street, killing the 39-year-old driver. No one else was injured. The dead man is identified as Kendell T. Lewis of O'Fallon, Ill.

The Illinois State Police accident-reconstruction team is investigating the crash.

Illinois Police Master Sgt. Brent Beltz said a Brooklyn police officer told dispatchers at about 3:15 a.m. Wednesday that he was in pursuit of a silver Ford Focus.

The driver had fled a traffic stop and apparently rammed a police car trying to get away. No officer was injured, police say. The driver was wanted for aggravated assault of a police officer, and the chase began.

About two minutes after the first call to dispatchers, the Brooklyn officer was asking for an ambulance because of the crash, Beltz said.

In the high-speed chase, Lewis had lost control of the Focus on a curve as he headed east on St. Clair Avenue, police say. The car hit a utility pole. Lewis overcorrected, causing the car to flip onto its side. Lewis was partly ejected from the car.

The car came to rest on its roof about 90 feet west of North 17th Street.

Lewis has an extensive criminal record. In St. Clair County, records show that Lewis has convictions for numerous traffic offenses and crimes that include domestic battery, fleeing a police officer, driving on a revoked license and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
