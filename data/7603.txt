A Tucson police officer shot and killed a man during a violent confrontation on the East Side on Wednesday night.

The officer suffered injuries in the fight and was taken to a hospital, said Lt. Rick Middleton, a Tucson police spokesman. His condition was not known.

The incident was one of two unrelated fatal shootings that occurred Wednesday evening in Tucson.

The officer, who was working alone, was sent at about 8 p.m. to the area of East Speedway and North Camino Seco to check on a man seen lying on the ground in the desert near there, Middleton said.

For some reason the man got up and started fighting with the officer.

The officer managed to call out on his radio that he needed immediate help, Middleton said.

At some point during the fight, the officer shot the man, he said.

The man, whose name was not released, was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Middleton said the man was in his 40s.

The shooting will be investigated by police and the Pima County Attorney's Office.

At about the same time, another shooting, near Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, claimed the life of a man in his late 20s, police said.

Police officers responded to a shooting call at South Palo Verde and East Golf Links roads and found the man dead from a gunshot wound, said Officer Steven Pupkoff.

Details of what happened where not available late Wednesday, but police were looking for at least one person believed to have been involved in that shooting.

The name of the victim was not available.
