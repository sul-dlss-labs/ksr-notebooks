New Mexico State Police are releasing details in a deadly police shooting in southern New Mexico.

NMSP says 55-year-old Gregory Allen Tilly barricaded himself inside a mobile home in Alamogordo earlier this month.

They say he came out pointing a shotgun at NMSP officer Fabian Picazo, so the officer shot Tilley.

He later died.

Officer Picazo has been with NMSP for three years and was with the Otero County Sheriffâ€™s Office 13 years before that.

Picazo was placed on standard administrative leave.
