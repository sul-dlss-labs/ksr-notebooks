SOUTH BEND â€” Prosecutors have filed multiple charges against the driver in a 2014 crash that killed one teen and seriously injured three others, including the driver, after he allegedly led Elkhart County police on a high-speed chase.

Police have said 19-year-old Yorlin Tharbs was driving a white Chevrolet Monte Carlo that crashed along Jefferson Road in eastern St. Joseph County after a chase that began with a reported burglary at a factory across the county line.

Seventeen-year-old Mario Beristain was killed in the crash. Two other 17-year-old boys had severe injuries and had to be placed on breathing tubes while they recovered. Tharbs was treated for broken wrists, legs and pelvis.

The six felony charges against Tharbs include counts of resisting law enforcement and causing death and serious injuries by driving while under the influence of drugs.

In court documents filed Wednesday, prosecutors alleged Tharbs had THC, the active chemical in marijuana, in his blood during the chase.

A St. Joseph Superior Court judge ordered an arrest warrant for Tharbs and ordered him held on $11,000 cash bond or $110,000 corporate surety.
