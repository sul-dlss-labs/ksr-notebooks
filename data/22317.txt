A man was shot and killed by police in the Bronx, the first police shooting in New York City captured on official NYPD body cameras, according to police.

Police say officers were called to a Pratt Avenue home Wednesday by a landlord who was concerned that he hadn't seen his tenant in awhile.

When the landlord opened the door to the tenant's apartment, officers found the tenant with a knife in one hand, and his other hand behind his back, according to NYPD Chief of Department Carlos Gomez.

Officers shouted at the man for several minutes, ordering him to drop his knife and asking what was in his other hand, insisting they didn't want to hurt him, Gomez said.

The man would not drop the knife and began to approach the officers. One officer deployed a stun gun on the man, and two other officers opened fire, shooting and killing him.

No officers were injured.

The weapon recovered from the man's other hand turned out to be a fake gun, police said.

Officials say the shooting was all captured on NYPD body cams, which were deployed in April starting in Washington Heights. NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said at the time the cameras will enhance transparency and accountability.

The suspect has not yet been identified.
