HORRY COUNTY, S.C. (WBTW) — One person was shot in an officer involved shooting while police responded to a barricaded person near Burgess, according to Mikayla Moskov with Horry County Police Department.

Officers responded to a home near Myerlee Drive, according to the Horry County Police Department.

Homes in the immediate area were evacuated out of caution, HCPD said.

Moskov said no officers were injured and there is no threat to the community. The person who was shot was taken to a local hospital.

SLED told News13 on Friday evening that police were responding to a request for a welfare check. When officers responded, the suspect presented a firearm at officers.

SLED says this was the 39th officer involved shooting in South Carolina in 2020. It was the second of the year involving the Horry County Police Department. The previous incident resulted in a man being killed. Officials said that when officers arrived during that incident, the armed suspect confronted police in the street.

In 2019, there were 45 officer-involved shootings in South Carolina. Three involved the HCPD.

SLED conducts law enforcement officer involved shooting (OIS) investigations at the request of the agency involved in the incident. When requested, SLED says its goal is to conduct a thorough, independent criminal investigation as timely as is possible under the circumstances. SLED investigators will conduct interviews with all potential witnesses and will collect all relevant evidence and forensically that evidence.
