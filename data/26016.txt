Thursday update: Manor police have identified 29-year-old Justin Trayon Thomas as the driver who died after a car chase involving police last week.

Thomas, whose next of kin have been notified, lived in Manor, police said. Police did not release any other details.

Authorities have said police initially tried to pull over Thomas for a traffic violation. Public records show that Thomas was previously convicted of possession of marijuana in 2008, burglary in 2013, manufacturing or delivering a controlled substance in 2007 and 2013, and driving without a license in 2013.

March 22: A man died early Friday after a car chase that began in Manor ended in a crash in Austin, Manor police said.

Around 12:40 a.m., officers tried to pull a vehicle over for a traffic violation near FM 973 and U.S. 290, but the vehicle did not stop and continued into Austin.

About 15 to 20 minutes later, the driver sideswiped a median on Interstate 35 South near William Cannon Drive, and hit an 18-wheeler, Manor Sgt. Craig Struble said.

"Officers immediately provided the driver, a 29-year-old male, CPR after seeing the driver needed medical assistance," police said.

The driver, who was not identified by police, was taken to St. David's South Austin Medical Center where he was pronounced dead. An autopsy will be performed by the Travis County medical examiner, Struble said.

Police said no force was used by officers during the incident and no one else was injured.
