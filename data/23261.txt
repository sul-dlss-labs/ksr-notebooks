A man shot by two police officers during a domestic disturbance call Friday has died, according to El Paso police.

According to a news release, police found Jorge Hidalgo, 43, holding a machete while standing next to his wife in a home located at 3820 Mountain.

Officials say Hidalgo ignored officers’ verbal commands and turned against them, raising the machete.

That’s when the two officers shot Hidalgo. He was taken to an area hospital where he later died.

Officials say the involved officers, who have been with the department for 3 and 7 years, have been placed on administrative leave.

The department’s Crimes Against Persons unit, the Shooting Review Team, and the Texas Rangers are investigating the incident.
