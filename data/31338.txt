An attempt to issue a domestic violence protective order had a deadly ending after Pender County Sheriff's Office deputies shot a 45-year-old Pender County armed man.

The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the officer-involved shooting that left Kevin Glenn Swinson dead on the scene.

According to the North Carolina Department of Public Safety inmate database, Swinson had been previously convicted of several charges of assault on a female in Pender County in the early 2000s, as well as other misdemeanor charges. Most recently, Swinson was incarcerated for eight months in 2011 and 2012 on charges of speeding to elude arrest and willful and wanton injury to real property.

According to a news release from the SBI, two deputies fired their weapons â€” Grant Simme and John Dragocastano. Sheriff Alan Cutler said the deputies encountered an armed Swinson at a home off of N.C. 210 in the Canetuck community on Dec. 14 and the shooting ensued.

Simme has been with the Pender County Sheriff's Office since 2018 and Dragocastano was hired in February 2021. Neither deputy has any record of dismissals, suspensions or demotions.

Following standard protocol, both deputies have been placed on leave during the investigation.

As the investigation continues, District Attorney Ben David said officials are working to determine if the level of force used was necessary. David said more details about the shooting, including whether or not shots were fired against the deputies, will be released following the investigation.

No additional details about the shooting or investigation have been released.
