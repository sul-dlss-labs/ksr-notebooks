Original story (June 13): The Denver Police Department said a suspect is dead after being shot by more than one officer on East Colfax Avenue on Sunday.

Around 5:30 p.m., DPD Division Chief Ron Thomas said dispatch received a call of shots being fired into a car at E. Colfax and Uinta Street. When officers arrived, witnesses told them the suspect headed east. They found the suspect with a gun in his waistband at Yosemite Street and E. Colfax Avenue.

Officers repeatedly issued commands and after refusing, the suspect threatened the officers with the weapon, Thomas said. Multiple officers fired at the suspect, he was hit, and aide was given before he was transported to the hospital.

Thomas said no officers were injured during the incident.

The suspect was later pronounced dead.

All westbound lanes of East Colfax Avenue at Yosemite were closed for the investigation.
