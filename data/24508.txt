Crime & Safety Eluding Denver Police, Man Caused Fatal Accident: Prosecutors Alberto Gonzales​, 37, will appear in court charged with killing 1 and injuring 2 in a May wreck when fleeing from a police stop. Reply

DENVER, CO – A man who caused a fatal accident while eluding Denver police will appear in Denver District Court this week.

Alberto Gonzales, 37, is charged with counts including vehicular homicide DUI; vehicular eluding resulting in death; leaving the scene of an accident and driving under restraint. Prosecutors say on the evening of May 27, Gonzales, on parole for earlier convictions from the Colorado Department of Corrections, was driving a silver Dodge Intrepid with no plates around 7 p.m. When police tried to curb the Dodge at a red light, Gonzales allegedly took off westbound on West First Avenue from North Federal Boulevard at high rate of speed, according to a police probable cause affidavit. Police did not follow the Intrepid, but Gonzales ran a red light at the intersection of West 1st Avenue and North Knox Court.

His car struck the passenger side of a car driven by a 60-year-old man. The impact killed a female passenger, age 61 and injured the driver and another passenger, age 62. The three occupants of the car were taken to a hospital. Gonzales then tried to flee the scene on foot, and attempted to carjack two other cars at an intersection, police said. Police said Gonzales resisted arrest when chased on foot by Denver officers, the arrest affidavit said. Gonzales was taken to a hospital with injuries.

Gonzales is scheduled to appear in Denver District Court on Sept. 6. He has been in custody in the Denver County Jail since May on a $100,000 bond. Image via Denver District Attorney's Office.
