HANOVER — A central Pennsylvania prosecutor says the shooting death of a man following a standoff with police last fall was a suicide.

The York County district attorney's office said in a report Wednesday that 53-year-old Brian Costley shot himself twice in the torso after retreating inside his West Manheim Township home.

District Attorney Tom Kearney also said an officer who fired at him moments before the 5½-hour standoff on Nov. 18 was justified in discharging his weapon.

State police said two township police officers tried to serve an arrest warrant on Costley, who was wanted in Carroll County, Maryland, for violation of pretrial conditions on a drunken driving charge.

Police said he began shooting at the officers, one of whom returned fire. Authorities later entered the home and found Costley dead.
