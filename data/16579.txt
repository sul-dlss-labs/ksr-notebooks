LONGVIEW, TX (KLTV) - A man shot by an officer in a Longview Walgreens parking lot has died.

Longview Police Department released a statement Tuesday saying Devin Dial was pronounced dead by Justice of the Peace B.H. Jameson.

Dial's body will be sent to Southwestern Institute of Forensic Sciences located in Dallas for autopsy.

About 11 p.m. on Aug. 28, an off-duty Longview police officer was at the Walgreens in the 1700 Block of West Loop 281 when he noticed an individual in a vehicle parked near the front of the store. The off-duty officer says the suspect, later identified as 23-year-old Devin Dial, of Longview, appeared to have a white mask covering his face, and the officer called police.

Officers then say Dial moved his vehicle to the west side of the building out of security camera view. When the first responding officer arrived and got out of his vehicle, Dial got out and displayed a Glock .380 caliber handgun to the officer. The officer fired his weapon, striking Dial, who was transported to Good Shepherd Medical Center.



Longview police released a statement Tuesday morning, saying Dial was pronounced dead on Sunday by Justice of the Peace B.H. Jameson. After being examined for signs of life, Dial was declared brain dead and was taken off of a ventilator.

Longview police say the Texas Rangers are conducting interviews of those involved and processing evidence from the scene. At this point, investigators have been able to confirm that the weapon Dial displayed was a Glock .380 caliber handgun.

The officer involved has been placed on paid administrative leave.
