Detectives are reviewing surveillance video showing what they described as a violent clash involving two men and a SEPTA police officer early Monday morning at a Market-Frankford Line station in Kensington.

The altercation ended with the SEPTA officer using his Taser to subdue one man, who later died at a local hospital, authorities said.

Police are now trying to determine who the dead man is and what killed him. Officials say the surveillance video, taken at the Huntingdon El stop, at Kensington Avenue and Huntingdon Street, about 2 a.m., shows the officer escorting the suspect out. The suspect then starts to argue with another man and the officer intervenes, according to officials. A struggle ensues and the officer uses his Taser to subdue the suspect, investigators said.

Police said the suspect, who remained a John Doe Monday afternoon, was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital and was later pronounced dead.

SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel released part of the surveillance video showing the officer subduing the suspect during a press conference Monday afternoon.

Chief Nestel said the officer, a 5-year veteran who works the midnight shift, was shutting down the Huntingdon El station at the time of the encounter. The officer suffered bite marks and bruises during the scuffle, according to Nestel. He was taken to the hospital and treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Nestel said the officer has never had an excessive force complaint against him during his career.

The Homicide Division is investigating the incident. A separate internal investigation is being conducted as well.
