Arnaudville, La. (AP) - A teenager died when she was struck by a stolen car involved in a high-speed chase. Sixteen-year-old Loretta Faye Bergeron was about to get into a van with her sister yesterday when a car sideswiped the van, striking Bergeron. She was pronounced dead at the scene. Bergeron had just left the home south of Arnaudville.

Sheriff's deputies say 42-year-old Landell Davis of Breaux Bridge was allegedly fleeing police in a stolen vehicle. Landell is facing charges of driving without a seat belt, hit-and-run, driving while intoxicated, negligent injury, negligent homicide, reckless operation of a vehicle and simple possession of marijuana.

Deputies say Saint Martin parish also will charge Davis with two counts of aggravated assault on a police officer for attempting to hit deputies with the car, illegal possession of stolen property and aggravated flight from an officer.
