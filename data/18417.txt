EAST POINT, Ga. -- One officer has been released, a second is recovering at the hospital and a suspect is dead after a shooting early Friday morning.

East Point Police responded to a 911 call about a domestic disturbance in the 3200 block of Lakeview Place at the Legends at Laura Creek Apartments between 3 and 3:30 a.m. One of the two persons involved had departed once officers arrived, police said. That person was seen nearby by other neighbors, according to police.

A short time later, officers discovered the male subject.

"It sounded like they were trying to get him to leave the premises," said Leslie Webster, who heard the argument from her balcony, "it sounded like he might have been intoxicated."

According to the GBI, the subject became combative and starting fighting with a female officer.

A male officer deployed a Taser and the female officer fired at the subject. Rounds from her weapon struck both the subject and the male officer. The subject was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in downtown Atlanta and died from his injuries, Nelly Miles, a GBI spokeswoman said.

The GBI later said the round that struck the officer was a superficial wound.

"(The officer) was sitting over there on the ambulance and he was hurt," Webster said.

The officers were taken to two local hospitals with non-life-threatening injuries, Miles said.

The GBI will continue its investigation, then turn over its findings to the Fulton County District Attorney's office for review upon completion.

The suspect's identity hasn't been released.

"I see him all the time," Webster said, "I think he lives here."
