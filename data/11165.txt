CLEVELAND, Ohio â€” A 42-year-old Maple Heights man was killed Wednesday evening trying to evade Newburgh Heights police.

Robert Dumas Jr. was pronounced dead at MetroHealth Medical Center after his vehicle crashed at 7:10 p.m. in the 2900 block of Broadway.

The chase began when Newburgh Heights officers tried to stop a speeding vehicle on Interstate 77 north, south of Fleet Avenue.

The vehicle didn't slow down, weaved through traffic and exited onto Broadway, where it struck a pedestrian, then collided with a concrete pole at 2960 Broadway, Cleveland Sgt. Sammy Morris said.

The pedestrian, 22-year-old Teanna Smith, of Parma, was treated at MetroHealth and has already been discharged, a spokeswoman said.

Dumas, whose birthday was Saturday, was not wearing a seat belt, Morris said.
