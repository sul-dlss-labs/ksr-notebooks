LUBBOCK, TX (KCBD) - The parents of a Texas Tech University student killed in a officer-involved crash last year have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the City of Lubbock.

Police say on August 13, 2014, Morgan Lee, 20, was driving a 2012 Hyundai Veloster headed southwest in the 3600 block of Landmark Lane, crossing Clovis Highway.

Officer Cody Kidd was driving a marked LPD vehicle, a 2011 Chevy Tahoe, heading southeast in the 3400 block of Clovis Highway.

Police say that after identifying, locating and interviewing all known witnesses and after reviewing available witnesses, investigators determined that both Lee and Officer Kidd were traveling in opposite directions on the Clovis Highway prior to impact and that the traffic signal at the intersection was solid green for both directions.
