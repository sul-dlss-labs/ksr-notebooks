CHICAGO (STMW) - A West Side man is dead after allegedly swallowing narcotics when officers attempted to arrest him Wednesday night in the Garfield Park neighborhood.

Police attempted to take the man – identified by the Cook County Medical Examiner's office as 26-year-old Paris Turner – into custody about 6:30 p.m. in the 0-100 block of South Whipple Street, police said. The area is a known narcotics area.

The man resisted arrested, appeared to swallow a bag of drugs then collapsed while running away, police said.

He was initially taken to a local hospital, police said. Turner was pronounced dead at 7:29 p.m. at Mount Sinai Hospital, according to the medical examiner's office.

Sources said it appears Turner overdosed on the drugs. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday, the medical examiner's office said.

An officer suffered minor injuries during the arrest and was taken to an area hospital of treatment, police said.

Harrison Area detectives are investigating.
