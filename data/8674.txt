Court records show a 54-year-old man who died following a police-involved shooting had a history of mental problems and trouble with the law.

Julian Dekeuninck died Saturday outside the Steeplegate Inn in Davenport. Authorities say he allegedly attacked a police officer with a knife and didn't drop the weapon when ordered by officer Elizabeth Tharp.

Records show Dekeuninck was a patient at Robert Young Center for Community Mental Health in Rock Island, Illinois.

He also had a long rap sheet, at one time facing charges for disorderly conduct. He also pleaded guilty to trespassing after he admitted he broke into a semitrailer and had to be forced to leave.

Tharp has been placed on paid administrative leave while authorities investigate.
