BOERNE, Texas â€“ The Texas Department of Public Safety has identified the man who they say was shot and killed by a trooper in Boerne during a foot chase Thursday.

DPS officials identified the man as Marcus McVae, 34.

Around 4:40 p.m. Thursday, DPS said a trooper tried to conduct a traffic stop for a moving violation as McVae was driving eastbound on I-10 in a Chevrolet Impala. McVae stopped and took off on foot across the highway.

When McVae got to the access road and into a wooded creek bed, there was a confrontation and fight between him and the trooper, officials said. The trooper then opened fire on McVae, who died at the scene.

DPS said a female passenger, later identified as Elizabeth Norton, took off with the vehicle. Troopers were able to catch up to her, and she surrendered.

Norton was taken into custody to be questioned by investigators.

The Texas Rangers are investigating the trooper-involved shooting. Once their investigation is completed, they will submit their findings to the Kendall County District Attorney's Office.

The trooper who shot the man is a five-year veteran of the force. He will be placed on administrative duty.
