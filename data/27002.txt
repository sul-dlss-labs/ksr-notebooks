Three men were killed and a fourth was critically injured after the car they were driving rolled over during a police chase following a burglary report on Friday morning in Los Angeles, the authorities said.

The encounter began around 4 a.m. in the 1700 block of Sunset Boulevard, where officers said they observed several people breaking into a business, said Tony Im , a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

The suspects then fled in a vehicle parked out front, described as an Infiniti S.U.V., and the police chased them north on the 101 Freeway, Mr. Im said.

“After a short distance, the officers lost sight of the vehicle,” he added. A police helicopter then spotted the car rolled over at the Rampart Boulevard ramp of the freeway in Echo Park.
