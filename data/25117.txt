A man wanted in connection with an armed bank robbery was found dead inside a Bethlehem home following a three-hour standoff with city police on Wednesday.

Northampton County Coroner Zachary Lysek on Wednesday night identified the deceased as Kevin Maguire, 33. He was staying at the 416 Hickory St. home where the standoff occurred, Lysek said.

He ruled Maguire's death a suicide caused by a gunshot wound.

Officers went to the home after Maguire was spotted there. He had a warrant out for his arrest on charges that on Aug. 21 he robbed the Santander Bank at 2191 W. Union Blvd., in Bethlehem.

"The male came to the door, displayed and brandished a firearm and refused to come out of the residence," city police Chief Mark DiLuzio says in a news release. "Officers spoke to the male and three juveniles were able to leave the house."

Bethlehem's Emergency Response and Crisis Negotiation teams arrived at the home and communicated with Maguire, but he continued to refuse to surrender, the chief says.

"After a period of time, approximately three hours or so, a single gunshot was heard coming from the house," DiLuzio says. "A BPD Robot was sent into the house and the male was located in the house on the floor. ERT Team members and medics entered the house and the male was found deceased."

He says no officers or other citizens were injured in the incident. There is no threat to the public and roads that were closed are now being reopened, DiLuzio says in the release issued at 3:40 p.m. Wednesday.

The bank robbery in which Maguire was charged happened about 1:30 p.m. Aug. 21. The robber displayed a handgun to a bank teller and demanded money. He ran away with an undisclosed amount of cash.
