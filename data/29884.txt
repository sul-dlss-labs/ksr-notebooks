A convicted burglar on probation suspected of stealing property from parked cars in Culver City was killed Wednesday in a crash trying to avoid police.

Culver City Police Department officers responded to the 9500 block of Jefferson Boulevard, near Culver City Park, on a call of a man breaking into two parked cars and stealing items from them, according to Lt. Sorai Estrada, the department’s public information officer.

Callers to 911 also reported that the man stole a silver Lexus after he entered it and manipulated some wires, Estrada said.

Officers located the man in the Lexus in the area of Obama Boulevard and Hauser Boulevard in Baldwin Hills and attempted to conduct a traffic stop, Estrada said.

The man did not stop and led police on a pursuit to the vicinity of La Brea Avenue and Obama Boulevard in the Crenshaw district, where the stolen vehicle he was driving collided with another vehicle, Estrada said.

The driver of the uninvolved car sustained minor injuries and the suspect drove away. Police called off the pursuit due to the suspect’s dangerous driving, Estrada said.

Officers later learned the allegedly stolen Lexus ran off the road and collided with a tree in the area of Overhill Drive and Springdale Drive in Windsor Hills, entrapping the man, according to Estrada.

Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department responded and pronounced the man dead at the scene. No one else was injured in the crash

The man, whose name was not released, was on probation for burglary with an active felony warrant and prior convictions for burglary, according to Estrada.
