An off-duty Customs Service inspector fatally shot a bodega clerk who approached him as he parked his car on a deserted Brooklyn street early yesterday morning, the police said.

The inspector, Martin Carrington, 38, has not been charged with a crime, the police said. He fired the shots from his licensed 9-millimeter handgun after arguing with the clerk, Wilson Alba, 31, of the Bronx, on Halsey Street near Irving Avenue in Bushwick about 1:45 a.m., the police said.

Exactly what happened between the two men on a block of graffiti-scarred, low-slung brick buildings was unclear.

Mr. Carrington had just gotten off work at Kennedy International Airport and was returning to his house, which is a few blocks from the intersection where he shot Mr. Alba, the police said. A plastic bag filled with takeout food sat on the passenger seat of his gold Chevrolet sedan.
