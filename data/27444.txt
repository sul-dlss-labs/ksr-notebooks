A Wind Gap teen was fleeing state troopers in his truck Sunday night in Monroe County when he hit several vehicles and drove into oncoming traffic, then lost control and rolled the vehicle, state police said.

Anthony Yerance, 18, was killed in the 8:37 p.m. crash in Hamilton Township and his passenger, Aaron Dotter, 18, of Nazareth, was seriously injured, according to the state policeâ€™s Stroudsburg barracks. Police say Yerance was not wearing a seat belt.

State police said they were dispatched Sunday night to a parking lot on Fetherman Road, where a large group of vehicles had gathered. Police said they received reports of drag racing and gunshots, but were unable to substantiate those reports.

As police investigated, Yerance fled the scene, hit a state police vehicle and then continued through the parking lot and crashed into four more vehicles before getting onto Fetherman Road and turning onto Cherry Valley Road, police said.

State police pursued Yerance, who sped into oncoming traffic before losing control and crashing, police said.

Yerance was pronounced dead at the scene. Dotter was taken to Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest.
