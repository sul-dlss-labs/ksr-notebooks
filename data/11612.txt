Authorities on Tuesday said the man shot and killed by police in Westchester was armed with a semi-automatic firearm that he pointed at officers before he was shot.

According to Miami-Dade Police, the man, identified as 55-year-old Henry Patterson, pointed the gun at detectives when they arrived at his home and refused to put down the weapon after several commands.

Patterson was killed in the shooting at 7860 S.W. 34th Terrace on Monday night, police said.

Officials said they arrived at the man's house to arrest him on an aggravated stalking charge when a confrontation ensued at the front door. A detective was forced to shoot and killed the man at the front door of his house, police said.

Patterson worked as a background investigator for the Miami-Dade Police Department from August 1986 to March 1998 when he resigned, records show.

Police said there had been a prior incident involving him but didn't give details.

Roy Rutland of Miami-Dade Police said, "We do know that we had incidents here with this same man," but did not comment further.

Police also questioned another man who was at the home at the time of the shooting.

Residents said they heard four or five shots and confirmed that the police had visited the house before.

"Just like I mentioned a year ago, lots of cops surrounded the house once, that was it," said Louis Lopez.

Other neighbors contended Patterson had guns and was well-known in the neighborhood and regarded as disagreeable.
