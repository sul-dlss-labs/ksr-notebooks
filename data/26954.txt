A suspect has died after a shooting involving police at a Taco Bell near 43rd and Olive avenues in Glendale Monday evening, police said.

Police identified the suspect on Tuesday as Matthew Rasmussen, 31.

No officers were injured in the incident.

Sgt. John Roth, a public information officer with Glendale police, said three officers responded to the Taco Bell after they got reports that a man with a blanket draped over his head was swinging a long metal object in the parking lot.

One of the officers started redirecting patrons in the parking lot back into the restaurant as the other two officers tried to communicate with the suspect.

As police tried to talk to Rasmussen, he continued acting erratically. Police tried to call for less lethal means of subduing him, but none were available, Roth said.

So the officers decided to go hands-on and detain Rasmussen to keep him from harming people walking around the area.

When one of the officers tried to take him down, Rasmussen revealed 12-inch metal forceps. Roth said the suspect started to stab and swing at the officers trying to detain him.

One officer withdrew and fired his gun, hitting the Rasmussen multiple times, Roth said.

Roth said after the shooting, police tried to administer life-saving measures until firefighters could arrive.
