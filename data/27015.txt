McAllister robbed the Wilson Senior Center just before it opened on November 13, taking cash and personal property from a patron the the center’s director, Evans said.

McAllister also hit the center’s director in the mouth – causing her lip to bleed.

Noble and Hill were on duty and next to the center when they heard of the robbery.

Evans said Hill, who was wearing a ballistic vest with “Police” in yellow on the front and back, began to search for a suspect.

Hill observed a person matching the suspect’s description – that person was later identified as McAllister.

The suspect began to run away before tripping and falling, Evans said.

Hill tried to handcuff McAllister and the “two engaged in a violent struggle on the ground,” Evans said.

During the course of the fight, McAllister bit Hill and fought over control of the officer’s gun, Evans said.

The struggle led Hill to believe “lethal force was necessary to avoid his imminent death or serious

bodily harm,” Evans said.

Hill got control of his gun and shot McAllister twice – killing the suspect, Evans said.

“Items of property recovered at the scene, and items later listed as removed from McAllister’s person, were identified as some of the items reported taken in the robbery,” Evans said.

The district attorney said Hill’s use of deadly force was justified and no criminal charges will be filed.

“This matter is closed,” Evans said.
