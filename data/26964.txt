Treva Smutherman, 31, of Fayetteville was identified as the suspect who was shot and killed.

At 8:22 a.m., a suspect, later identified as Smutherman, attempted to take a deputy’s weapon which led to a struggle. Both were shot during that struggle, Chief Gina Hawkins said.

Smutherman was shot and killed by a Fayetteville police detective who was nearby in the hospital on an unrelated matter, police said.

The deputy suffered a non-life threatening gunshot wound and is receiving treatment.

The deputy is said to be in “good condition,” Sheriff Ennis Wright said. The deputy’s name won’t be released until the sheriff notifies his family.

Smutherman was arrested Tuesday night on active warrants for a home invasion, Wright said. He was taken to the hospital after experiencing medical issues following his arrest.

By 9 a.m., authorities said the shooter was no longer active.

The SBI has been contacted which is standard protocol for an officer-involved shooting.

The call initial made as an active shooter at the hospital. Police quickly secured the scene and allowed people back in the hospital.

CBS 17 has been digging into Smutherman’s criminal history.

In September, he was arrested on outstanding warrants at a Fayetteville motel.

Officers say he resisted arrest, caused cuts and scrapes to two deputies, and damaged their equipment.

We also learned he had prior child neglect and drug possession charges from South Carolina.
