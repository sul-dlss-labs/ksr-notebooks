HOUSTON

It all went down on Dewalt and West Montgomery in northwest Houston last night. Police say two undercover officers were sitting in an unmarked vehicle conducting surveillance when a couple of men approached them.

One of the men, identified as 51-year-old Kevin Bernard Hunter, began beating on the officers' vehicle and yelling profanities at them. Hunter then threatened to kill the officers. The officers then jumped into action after Hunter started stabbing and slashing at one of them.

"Both officers discharged their weapon, striking the suspect," said John Cannon with the Houston Police Department "The suspect was using a box cutter type instrument. Paramedics tried to revive him, but he died here at the scene."

The officer, a 20-year veteran of the Houston Police Department, was taken to the hospital. He was treated for his wounds and released.

Both officers are on administrative duty for three days, which is HPD policy.
