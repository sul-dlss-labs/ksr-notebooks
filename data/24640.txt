NILES, MI -- David Lee Bross Jr., 24, was killed after his 2009 Subaru crashed into a tree during a police pursuit near Niles Saturday, July 28.

The Berrien County man was pronounced dead at Memorial Hospital in South Bend after a fleeing a county sheriff's deputy in a Saturday, July 28, chase that began in the city of Niles and ended just west of U.S. 31, near Buchanan, according to a news release.

The deputy who pursued him was placed on leave pending the results of an ongoing investigation, according to the release.

A Berrien County Sheriff deputy attempted to pull over the Subaru at 5:27 p.m. Saturday, noting the vehicle matched the description from an earlier message to be on the lookout for a potentially intoxicated driver.

As the deputy started pulling over the vehicle, Bross fled the scene. Police said he led the deputy on a pursuit that left Niles to the west on Niles Buchanan Road, after the Subaru sideswiped a vehicle within city limits.

During the pursuit, police said, the driver made "several erratic driving maneuvers" and exceeded speeds of 100 mph.

About three minutes after the chase began, it ended at 5:30 p.m. when Bross lost control of the vehicle on Niles Buchanan Road west of Mayflower Road. The car left the north side of the road and struck a tree, police said, causing major damage to the car.

The deputy reports losing Bross's vehicle in a cloud of dust when he fled. The deputy was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation into the crash being conducted by the Michigan State Police, working in conjunction with the county sheriff's office.

Bross was unresponsive at the scene and he was transported to Memorial Hospital in South Bend, Indiana, by ambulance. He was later pronounced dead. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday, July 30.

Once completed, the crash investigation will be forwarded to the Berrien County prosecutor's office for review.
