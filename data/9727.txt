WAUKEGAN, Ill. (STMW) - A Lisle man who used his vehicle to break into a Target store and steal a flat-screen television has been charged in a fatal accident after he allegedly ran a red light and struck another vehicle killing a 25-year-old Grayslake woman.

Donald Mischke, 54, has been charged with DUI and police expect more charges to be filed, Waukegan police Lt. Edward Fitzgerald said Thursday.

Killed was Elisha Clark, 25, who lived in the 100 block of Glen Street in Grayslake. She was pronounced dead at the scene around 3:30 a.m. Thursday, Lake County Coroner Dr. Richard Keller said.

Fitzgerald said Clark was driving a Buick Century east on Belvidere Road when a southbound Mazda that witnesses said was traveling at a high rate of speed on Green Bay Road disobeyed the red light and struck Clark's vehicle on the driver's side.

The Mazda was registered to an owner in Coon Rapids, Minn. Fitzgerald said more charges are pending for Mischke.

He said Mischke used the Mazda to ram the front door of the Target store on North Lewis Avenue just enough to break it. He then ran inside and allegedly took a flat- screen television.

Fitzgerald said police tried to pull Mischke over, but he sped off and police called off the pursuit, tracking him as different officers spotted the vehicle.

He said there was an off-duty officer at the intersection of Belvidere and Green Bay roads when the accident happened and he called it into dispatch.

Mischke was taken to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville, where he was listed in fair condition Thursday night.
