State agents are investigating the fatal shooting of a man Wednesday in Watts involving an Adair County sheriff’s deputy.

A Watts police officer and the deputy responded about 7:30 p.m. to a report of domestic abuse in the 472500 block of East 610 Road, according to a news release from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

The officers reportedly told investigators that Stoney McJunkin, 40, exited his residence and raised a metal pipe in a threatening manner when they arrived.

McJunkin allegedly refused to drop the pipe when commanded. The deputy, who has not yet been identified, shot McJunkin, according to the release.

Emergency responders pronounced him dead at the scene.

The OSBI says its special agents, upon completion of their investigation, will submit a report to the district attorney. The DA will subsequently “determine how to proceed with the case,” according to the release.

Watts is on Oklahoma 59 about five miles south of West Siloam Springs.
