Suspect Fatally Shoots Self at 12964 Market Street

December 7, 2009 - Houston police are investigating the death of a man who fatally shot himself after an exchange of gunfire with a Houston police officer at 12964 Market Street about 9:45 a.m. on Saturday (Dec. 5).

The suspect, Stuart Proulx, 49, of Houston, suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene. On Sunday (Dec. 6), the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Proulx’s death a suicide.

Senior Police Officer C. Lagroue, a 26-year veteran, assigned to the Northeast Patrol Division, was not injured when Proulx fired at him. Officer Lagroue returned fire but did not strike the suspect.

HPD Homicide Sergeant J.T. Wyers and Senior Police Officer R.P. Martinez reported:

Patrol officers were responding to a report of a family disturbance involving a weapon at the Market Street Baptist Church. Upon arrival, the suspect, Proulx, fired several shots with a 20 gauge shotgun from an upstairs window at Officer Lagroue, who returned fire. Neither man was struck during this exchange. Proulx then barricaded himself inside the church. HPD’s S.W.A.T. team then took command of the scene and later discovered the suspect was deceased inside the church from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

As is customary when an HPD officer discharges a weapon in the city limits, this case will be investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
