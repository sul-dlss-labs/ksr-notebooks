GRAHAM, N.C. — A man was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Graham, according to police.

At about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday night, police were responding to 716 E. Elm St to serve a warrant after receiving an anonymous tip that Jaquyn Oneill Light, 20, of Graham, was at the address, police said at a Wednesday news conference.

Officers had warrants for two felony probation violation, misdemeanor communicating threats and misdemeanor simple assault.

Three officers were on scene speaking with a person at the home when an officer saw Light inside the home, police say. Light allegedly ran from the home and encountered Officer Marcus Pollock.

During this interaction, Pollock fired a gun, hitting the man, police said.

“The SBI is conducting the criminal investigation at this part. The only people that witnessed the discharge of the firearm were the officer and Mr. Light,” Lt. Daniel Sisk said.

Light was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

No officers were injured.

Neighbors told FOX8 the area was typically quiet, and they hadn’t heard anything leading up to the shooting.

“I am concerned that someone was shot in the area, this close to my house, but I’m more concerned that I didn’t hear it,” said Karen Pollock, who lives near the home.

Marcus Pollock was placed on administrative leave while SBI investigates.

Graham police say it has been about 20 years since someone was killed in an officer-involved shooting in Graham.

“It is not a small matter to be responsible for taking a life,” Chief Jerry Prichard said.

He announced during a news conference Wednesday that he will meet with Light’s family to discuss what happened.
