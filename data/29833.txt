A man fatally shot himself Thursday night on a pedestrian bridge over Interstate 494 in Bloomington during a confrontation with police, officials say.

Officers responded about 6:15 p.m. to a report of a man walking with a gun near 78th Street and Second Avenue, where they found the man firing a handgun from the pedestrian bridge, according to a news release issued by the Bloomington Police Department.

A Bloomington officer fired his service weapon at the man, but it was not immediately clear whether he was struck by the gunfire, the news release said.

The man continued shooting his handgun from the pedestrian bridge for the next 10 minutes, but police did not return fire, according to the news release.

The man eventually climbed outside the bridgeâ€™s safety fencing and shot himself, falling onto the I-494 below, where officers attempted first aid, the news release said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

The incident halted interstate traffic in both directions for a couple of hours.

Officials had not received any reports of motorists or pedestrians struck by gunfire as of 10 p.m. Thursday, and no officers were injured.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the incident.
