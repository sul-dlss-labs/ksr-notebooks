Roger Williams, a 41-year-old black man was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Thursday, March 3, at Raymond and Florence avenues in Vermont-Slauson, according to authorities.

LAPD Officer Greg Baek said Williams was armed with a gun at the time of the shooting. The confrontation between Williams and officers from the 77th Street Division occurred shortly after 11 p.m.

Patrol officers had stopped a pedestrian "when the suspect drove up honking his car horn and screaming at the officers," according to an LAPD news release.

"The suspect who had gotten out of his car, waved a semi-automatic hand gun at the officers and began screaming obscenities at the officers," the release said. "The suspect put the handgun on the roof of his car then turned toward the officers and began walking toward them continuing to scream obscenities at them."

At that point, the officer in the passenger seat of the patrol car armed himself with a rifle. Williams then allegedly approached the officers who "continued to order the suspect to stop." He was shot after allegedly reaching toward his waistband. Williams, who was hit several times in the torso, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

Los Angeles police said one semi-automatic handgun was recovered at the scene.

The shooting is under investigation, which is routine in incidents involving use-of-force by the police.
