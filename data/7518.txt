A man was shot and killed Wednesday night after a standoff with Alaska State Troopers in Craig, according to a brief statement released this morning.

Troopers went to the A&B apartment complex around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and found Timothy Shawn Lloyd, 27, suicidal and armed inside, the statement said. During a standoff, Lloyd pointed his gun at officers and fired several times. In reaction, a trooper on the scene shot him. Lloyd was declared dead shortly after.

Per department policy, the trooper who fired his gun will be placed on administrative leave for three days. The identity of the trooper will be released when the leave is over, troopers said.

Craig is on a small island near Prince of Wales Island, 56 miles northwest of Ketchikan.
