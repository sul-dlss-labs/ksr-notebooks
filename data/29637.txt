EAST CLEVELAND, Ohio (WJW)– A man died following a police-involved shooting in East Cleveland Wednesday morning.

Police responded to a domestic incident just after 10 a.m. on Bryn Mawr Road, where a woman reported her ex-boyfriend possibly had a gun.

East Cleveland police said officers found the man trying to get into the woman’s car. She yelled at officers that the man had a gun, according to the police department.

An officer noticed the butt of the weapon in the man’s security vest and tried to take it. That’s when the man reached for the gun and the officer fired his weapon, police said. He was taken to University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center, where he died.

East Cleveland police said the woman reported her ex pulled a gun on her several times in the past and she witnessed him pull the gun on the officer.

The Ohio Attorney General’s Office said bureau of criminal investigation agents were requested.

Early last month, there was another officer-involved shooting in East Cleveland. Police said a suspect pulled out a gun after officers chased a stolen car. Police fired shots, killing the man.
