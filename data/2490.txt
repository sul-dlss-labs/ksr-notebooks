The police shot and killed a 28-year-old man early yesterday morning in a housing project in Brooklyn after he fired 17 shots into the air in what apparently was celebratory gunfire to mark a friend's birthday, Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said.

The investigation of the 3 a.m. shooting on Carlton Avenue in the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene was interrupted twice by gunmen who fired on officers who flooded the area to search for evidence and interview witnesses, Mr. Kelly said. Five of the nine gunshots in the second incident hit a police Emergency Service Unit truck, narrowly missing an officer sitting in one of the trucks, Mr. Kelly said.

The two later eruptions of gunfire, one about 3:30 a.m. and the second about 4 a.m., brought an even larger police response, with department helicopters hovering over the project and tracing their searchlights across the rooftops as heavily armed officers combed through the buildings, residents said. In several cases, officers knocked down doors as they hunted for the gunmen, residents said, and the police said they arrested about 20 people on outstanding warrants throughout the morning.

Commissioner Kelly said yesterday afternoon that while the investigation of the fatal shooting was in its early stages, a preliminary review indicated that the shooting of the the man, identified as Floyd Quinones, a convicted robber who had grown up in the neighborhood and had a lengthy arrest record, was justified under police guidelines. Later yesterday, Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city's chief medical examiner, said an autopsy found that Mr. Quinones had been shot in the back. The shooting will also be investigated by the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, and presented to a grand jury, as are all fatal police shootings.
