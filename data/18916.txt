Authorities on Tuesday identified a man who was fatally shot during a weekend encounter with Mohave County sheriff’s deputies in the Colorado River community in Golden Shores.

Lt. Shane Sloma of the Lake Havasu City Police Department said deputies responded early Monday evening to the 4500 block of Park Drive after a woman reported that she had been shot at by her neighbor.

“Upon arrival, the deputies were confronted by Drey Krause (age unavailable), who was armed with a shotgun,” Sloma said in a statement. “Krause refused repeated commands from the deputies to drop the shotgun. One of the deputies fired his duty weapon and struck Krause.”

Krause was pronounced dead following transport to a nearby hospital; no one else was injured.

The deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave while Lake Havasu City police investigate the incident, which is customary in officer-involved shootings in Arizona.
