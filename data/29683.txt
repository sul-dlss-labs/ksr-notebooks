A suspected gunman who barricaded himself inside a Jamul home and refused to come out for over 16 hours was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound Tuesday morning, authorities said.

The initial shooting was reported at 11:55 a.m. Monday at a house on Lyons Valley Road near Daley Truck Trail, according to San Diego County Sheriff’s Lt. Joel Stranger.

Deputies responded to the scene and found a man outside suffering from a gunshot wound to his upper body, Stranger said. The man, whose age was not immediately available, was taken to a hospital, where he underwent surgery for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries and was in stable condition Tuesday morning.

Deputies surrounded the home, believing the shooting suspect — a 64- year-old man — was inside and armed with a gun, Stranger said. Deputies made several loudspeaker announcements requesting that the suspect surrender, but the man refused.

The sheriff’s Crisis Negotiations Team and Special Enforcement Detail were called to the scene.

“Once on scene, the Crisis Negotiations Team made contact with the suspect via telephone and spoke with him for several hours in an attempt to get him to peacefully surrender,” the lieutenant said. “After several hours of refusing to cooperate with the Crisis Negotiations Team and exit the residence, the Special Enforcement Detail used chemical agents in an attempt to safely force the armed suspect to surrender and exit the residence.”

Armed personnel entered the home shortly before 4:30 a.m. Tuesday and found the man dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound in the attic, Stranger said. The suspect’s name was withheld pending family notification.
