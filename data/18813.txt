In a statement, the Irving Police Department says officers were called at about 6 p.m. Friday to the Homewood Suites by Hilton on Wingren Drive just north of State Highway 114 after shots were fired in one of the rooms.

Officers identified the room and surrounded it when more shots were fired. At least one bullet went through the wall, said Irving police spokesman James McLellan.

Police say the unidentified man exited the room and failed to drop his handgun after being asked to do so by officers.

McLellan said at least one of the officers fired at the man, killing him, after fearing for the officers' safety.

The identities of the suspect and the officers were not immediately released as the investigation into the shooting continues.

There are no reports of any other injuries.
