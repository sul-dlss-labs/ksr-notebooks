COLUMBUS - Platte County Attorney Andrea Belgau says a grand jury will not be convened in the death of 42-year-old Joseph Brian Braun of Columbus.

She said careful consideration of the facts surrounding the events and drowning of Braun Friday in the Loup Canal following a police pursuit found that a grand jury investigation is not warranted.

Nebraska statute requires a grand jury to be convened in cases where a county coroner certifies the death of an individual occurred while being apprehended or in the custody of law enforcement.

“At this time an autopsy has been completed, and the cause of death has been determined to be drowning,” Belgau said in a phone interview Wednesday. “Blood toxicology reports won't be available for several weeks.”

Braun, 42, died Friday after crashing a 1987 Chevy pickup into the Loup Canal approximately five miles east of Monroe. He was recovered from the water and pronounced dead at the scene.

Braun had been pursued by the Nebraska State Patrol before the accident occurred. The pursuit began at approximately 3:20 p.m., when a state trooper attempted to stop him for speeding while he was driving on Highway 22, approximately five miles east of Monroe.

Braun drove the vehicle onto a muddy cornfield about six miles northwest of Platte Center and escaped the pursuit when the trooper's cruiser became stuck in the mud.

A short time later, the Platte County Sheriff's Office received a report that a pickup matching the description of the vehicle driven by Braun had crashed into the Loup Canal. The sheriff's office and the Platte County Dive Team responded to the scene.
