An armed burglary suspect was fatally shot Sunday in Westmont by police officers.

No officers were injured and a gun was recovered at the scene, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

A call came in about 7:30 a.m. for a burglary alarm in the 2100 block of West Century Blvd., Los Angeles police Officer Mike Lopez said.

“Upon their arrival, officers were confronted by one armed suspect and an officer-involved-shooting occurred,” Lopez said on Twitter.

Police told ABC7 News the suspect allegedly fired at the responding officers but missed.

The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. His name was withheld pending notification of kin.

A witness at the scene told City News Service that a man cut a hole in the roof of a marijuana dispensary and fired shots at police when leaving the dispensary, resulting in his death.

Calls to the dispensary went unanswered.

Lopez said an investigation was underway and representatives from the Office of Inspector General and District Attorney’s Office were also present, along with someone from the LAPD Family Liaison Unit.

Why the liaison unit responded to the scene was unclear.

This was second fatal shooting by authorities in the Westmont area this month.

The earlier deputy-involved-shooting was on Feb. 4.

The family of Anthony Weber, a 16-year-old boy killed by a sheriff’s deputy in the 200 block of West 107th Street Westmont, has filed a complaint with the county’s Office of Inspector General alleging a cover-up by law enforcement.
