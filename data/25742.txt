A Dothan man is charged with murder after the SUV he was driving, and being pursued by police, struck other vehicles. It's not his first brush with the law.

Dothan Police spokesperson Lieutenant Rachel David said Jeremy Jermaine Jones, 38, had involvement in several crimes that occurred Monday, including possibly robbery and kidnapping. Officers had been told to keep a lookout for him.

About 6 p.m., a patrolman spotted what he believed to be a stolen SUV driven by Jones and began pursuing the vehicle.

Police Lieutenant Rachel David said Jones, during the brief chase, drove south in the northbound lanes of Ross Clark Circle at speeds estimated at 90 miles per hour.

Then, at the Kelly Drive intersection, he caused a wreck that involved several vehicles, according to David.

Paul Roberts, 63, of Dothan died from the impact to his Volkswagen Passat and others were taken to the hospital for treatment.

In addition to murder, Jones is expected to face several other charges.

His prior criminal history indicates arrests for cocaine and marijuana possession and other crimes.

Sentenced to 18 years in prison for a 2011 burglary conviction, the Alabama Department of Corrections released Jones on October 29, 2013, per records.

Then, three months later, a Houston County Grand Jury indicted him for escaping from a work release program. A judge sentenced him to 20 years. However, by August 2016 Jones had been released again.
