Michael Carmody

, the 23-year-old Jersey City native who engaged in a shoot-out with a Paramus police officer Sunday night, died this afternoon, officials said.

Carmody was taken off life support at St Josephâ€™s Regional Medical Center at 2:48 p.m. and died a few minutes later, at 3:02 p.m., Acting Police Chief Christopher Brock and the Bergen County Prosecutor's Officer said in two different statements, according to news reports.

Following a chase on Route 17 that ended near the exit for the Garden State Parkway, Carmody began firing his weapon at Police Officer Rachel Morgan, hitting her twice in the abdomen and once in a leg.



Carmody was shot six times, officials said.



Earlier this week, officials said Carmody suffered permanent brain damage from his injuries.

Morgan remains is in critical but stable condition, but she continues to improve Paramus Mayor Richard LaBarbiera told northjersey.com today.

Morgan started following Carmody, a resident of Westwood, because he was speeding and his car had fictitious plates, officials said.



While speeding away, Carmody lost control of his car and made a 180-degree turn into a snow ditch.



Carmody was a student at Jersey City's prestigious McNair Academic High School for the better part of the 2001-2002 school year. But he was expelled after a teacher caught him in a restroom showing a BB gun to another student, according to friends of Carmody.



In late August 2008, a car in which Carmody was the passenger crashed into a utility pole on Tonnelle Avenue in Jersey City and the driver, 22-year-old Robert Castro, died. Carmody suffered massive internal injuries in that incident.
