GWINNETT COUNTY, Ga. â€” Deputies say a man was killed when a driver in a stolen car hit him.

Jose Panameno, 51, was killed Tuesday night in Gwinnett County.

The deputy tried to get the driver, identified as William Jackson, 37, to pull over.

Authorities say there was a pursuit that lasted less than a minute and speeds reached more than 100 miles per hour.

Deputies say Panamero was at a stop light on Satellite Boulevard when Jackson came down Beaver Ruin Road, jumped the median and crashed into him. Authorities say Jackson got out and ran into the woods.

"There's no excuse for loss of life," Gwinnett County Sheriff's Offfice Chief Deputy Lou Solis said.

Soils said the pursuit was within procedure and the deputy was about to call it off when the crash happened. He said he questioned Jackson, who gave a confession and apology.

"All he kept saying was, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please tell the family I'm sorry,'" Solis said.

Solis said he asked Jackson why he didn't pull over, "and the first thing he said was, 'My kids.'"

Jackson is facing several charges, including murder. When he was arrested, deputies learned he was wanted on theft and obstruction charges out of three counties.
