KENT, Wash. â€” A 38-year-old man is dead after an officer shot and killed him early Monday morning, according to Kent police.

Authorities said it happened about midnight in the 9500 block of Canyon Drive Southeast and 94th Avenue.

It happened when Kent officers were called to help out Auburn police, who were in pursuit of a vehicle that was involved in a hit-and-run and then drove into Kent, police said.

KIRO 7 was told that Auburn police deployed spike strips that disabled one of the suspect's tires, but it did not stop the vehicle.

Then Kent police officers found the vehicle and performed a PIT maneuver, pinning the suspect's car, police said.

Officers said they tried to contact the suspect but the man fired at least one shot at a Kent officer. The officer fired back, striking the man.

Authorities said officers performed lifesaving measures but the man died while being transported to the hospital.

No officers were injured.

The eight-year veteran Kent police officer who shot the man has been placed on administrative leave, as that is standard procedure, police said.

Twelve officers who were issued body cameras in the Kent Police Department's pilot program were not involved in the incident.

"The deceased male in this incident chose to take deadly actions against our officer and forced him to take action to defend himself and his fellow officers," Chief Rafael Padilla stated.

A third-party independent investigation is being conducted by the Valley Investigative Team, the Kent Police Department said.
