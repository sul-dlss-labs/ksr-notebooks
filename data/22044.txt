(Cookeville, TN-AP) June 20, 2006 - Authorities in Tennessee are investigating the death of a man who stopped breathing after scuffling with Cookeville police and being shocked by a Taser.

Jason Troy Dockery died in a hospital after police said they used a Taser on him early Sunday because he was combative.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident and an autopsy will be performed.

Police Chief Bob Terry said his officers didn't do anything wrong.

The incident happened when police responded to a disturbance call.

Broadcast reports in Nashville say the officer who used the Taser is the same officer who fatally shot a North Carolina family's dog during a stop in 2003. A TBI spokeswoman wouldn't comment on that.
