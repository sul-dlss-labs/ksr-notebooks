A Cedar City police officer was put on paid administrative leave as investigators looked into the details of a fatal shooting that left a 56-year-old man dead.

The officer, an eight-year law enforcement veteran, fired three shots at the man after he approached officers with a gun pointed at them while they responded to a phone call that had been placed by his wife, according to a release issued late Tuesday from the Cedar City Police Department.

The man's wife had called and reported to police that he was making threats toward her, toward himself and toward the woman's adult son, according to the release. Four officers arrived and spoke with family members outside the home before announcing their presence and asking the man to come outside with his hands, visible according to the release.

The man emerged with a handgun pointed toward the officers, and the one officer fired at the man, according to the release.

The man, who was identified as James Aubrey, Sr., was pronounced dead at the scene. Officers did make lifesaving attempts immediately after he was shot, according to the release.

The Iron-Garfield-Beaver Critical Incident Task Force was tasked with investigating the incident.
