SALISBURY — A Salisbury Police officer has been cleared of wrongdoing in the December shooting death of a Salisbury man.

Officer K.H. Boehm, a three-year veteran, responded to a suspicious person call at 319 Vance Ave. on the night of Dec. 3, 2010. The suspicious person was later identified as Robert Lee Faulkner, 37.

Faulkner was causing a ruckus at an apartment and refused to comply with the officer’s orders to come away from the apartment.

Faulkner charged at the officer and the two struggled, the statement said.

The officer was not able to reach for his asp or pepper spray because Faulkner was on top of him. Faulkner repeated punched the officer in the face. After numerous warnings to stop, the officer shot Faulkner in the arm, shoulder and chest. He was taken to the hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. He died the next day.

The medical examiner concluded that Faulkner had been shot three times. Medical records indicate that Faulkner’s laboratory urine results at the hospital were positive for cocaine and marijuana.

The SBI was called to investigate the shooting. Rowan District Attorney Brandy Cook reviewed the agency’s investigation and concluded “no criminal charges will be filed against him (Officer Boehm) for the shooting death of Mr. Robert Lee Faulkner,” she said today in a statement.
