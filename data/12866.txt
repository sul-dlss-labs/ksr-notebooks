SANTA ANA â€“ Police on Friday identified the pedestrian hit during a car chase as well the man shot by police during an altercation that promoted the pursuit.

Santa Ana resident Andrew Scott Reisse, 33, was hit by a car whose driver and passengers reportedly were fleeing from police just after noon Thursday. He was in a crosswalk at MacArthur Boulevard and Flower Street, Cpl. Anthony Bertagna of the Santa Ana Police Department said. The crash threw Reisse about 30 feet, and he died at the scene.

The confrontation and chase began when gang detectives, who were looking for someone in the area, saw two vehicles stopped in the middle of the street in the 1000 block of Rosewood Court, and a group of several men both inside and outside the cars, Bertagna said.

Officers got into an altercation with one man, who police had documented as a gang member, Bertagna said. During the altercation, police shot Gerardo Diego Ayala, 26, and he died at a hospital several hours later.

Three of the men, whom officers believed to be armed, then sped off in a white Dodge Charger with police in pursuit, Bertagna said. The Dodge hit a car at West Warner Avenue and South Parton Street, then continued south on South Flower Street.

In addition to hitting and killing Reisse at MacArthur Boulevard, the driver also collided with a truck, police said. With the vehicle damaged, the three men got out and scattered. They were all taken into custody after one surrendered, another was subdued with a Taser and the third was bitten by a police dog after he reportedly did not comply with orders.

The driver of the Dodge, Victor Sanchez, 21, was treated for injuries and expected to be booked on suspicion of murder, Bertagna said. He also is a documented gang member, Bertagna said.

One gun was found after the confrontation and pursuit, Bertagna said, but authorities declined to say where it was located.
