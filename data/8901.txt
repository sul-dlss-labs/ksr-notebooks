A 22-year-old man was fatally shot by the police outside a Brooklyn elementary school on Monday afternoon after he pointed a fake gun at an officer, the authorities said.

The man, identified by a law enforcement official as George D’Amato Jr. of Brooklyn, showed up behind Public School 194, at 3117 Avenue W in the Gerritsen Beach neighborhood, about 3:10 p.m., and someone called 911 to report a man with a gun.

A Police Department spokesman said Mr. D’Amato had waved the fake gun at two adults. School had been let out about half an hour earlier, and no children were in danger, the police said.

When an officer arrived, Mr. D’Amato pointed the fake pistol at him, the police said. The officer then fired three rounds, striking Mr. D’Amato in the neck, torso and arm. The imitation pistol was silver-colored, and the barrel was inscribed “Zebra-II.”
