A 27-year-old Baton Rouge Police Officer who's been on the force just two and a half years is recovering tonight, and a man suspected of trying to break into a plantation is dead after the officer's gun fired two shots into his chest.

It started at 4:15 this morning when the officer responded to a burglary alarm that went off at the Magnolia Mound Plantation on Nicholson Drive.

When the officer saw a man on the grounds of the fenced plantation, he tried to question him, but had to chase the man on foot down Nicholson toward Van Buren.

During the chase the man swung a tire tool at the officer. The officer caught up with the suspect in a ditch in the 1900 block of Nicholson Drive and tried to arrest him.

When EMS arrived on the scene, they rushed the suspect to Baton Rouge General Mid-City Hospital, where he died about an hour later of the two gunshot wounds to the chest.

Corporal Kelly tells 9 News the man killed was a 47-year-old man from a neighborhood in New Orleans destroyed by the hurricanes. The man reportedly had been living in a shelter in Lafayette, and had been released from Hunt Correctional Center sometime in September of this year.

The police officer joined the Baton Rouge Police Department in March of 2003. He is expected to be released from the hospital today after being treated for bruises and cuts in the struggle.
