Officer Brock Lofgren shot and killed a man he believed was threatening a fellow officer with an axe, according to a decision letter from the DA.

A Colorado Springs police officer was justified in shooting a 48-year-old man who was found sleeping in a stolen vehicle, according to a ruling released Thursday by the 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office.

The decision comes following an incident on Jan. 12 in which Officer Brock Lofgren fired at a suspect, later identified as Bill Akes, who he believed was getting ready to strike a fellow officer with an axe, according to the decision letter.

According to the letter, Lofgren was patrolling a parking lot at an apartment complex at 340 Crestone Ln. where he found Akes sleeping in a GMC pickup truck that had been reported stolen out of Fountain.

Lofgren parked his cruiser directly in front of the truck to prevent it from driving away, and Colorado Springs Police Sgt. Shawn Peterson later arrived as backup, the letter says.

After Peterson also parked his vehicle in front of the truck, Akes woke up. The letter says Lofgren then grabbed Akes' arm and began giving commands for him to get out of the truck.

Peterson ran to the back of the truck to help and, with both officers inside the door, Akes then rammed Lofgren's cruiser, according to the decision letter.

A struggle ensued in which Lofgren unsuccessfully attempted to tase Akes, and then fired what he said were three shots after Akes raised a hatchet or axe into the air, the decision letter says.

Four shell casings were discovered at the scene and a hatchet was removed from the truck.

Akes was pronounced dead at the scene, and the letter says an autopsy determined he had methamphetamine in his system.
