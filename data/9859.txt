Crime & Safety El Granada Man Seriously Injured, Burlingame Man Dead After Motorcycle Collision With CHP On Highway 101 The accident took place in Redwood City on Thursday night. Reply

Joseph Coles, 19, of El Granada has been identified as the man who suffered major injuries on Thursday night after the motorcycle he was riding with Burlingame man Grant Coles, 45, collided with a California Highway Patrol (CHP) car on Highway 101, according to Art Montiel, CHP spokesman.

The crash occurred after a short-lived attempt by the riders on the motorcycle to elude the CHP after patrol officers tried to pull them over for violating the speed limit on Highway 101 north of Ralston Avenue at about 9:30 p.m., according to Montiel. The motorcycle exited the highway at Holly Street, where the men attempted to elude CHP officers before re-entering southbound Highway 101 at Harbor Boulevard, Montiel said.

As the motorcycle approached Brittan Avenue, a patrol car on the on-ramp to Highway 101 began accelerating to assist in the pursuit. For reasons yet to be determined, the motorcycle crossed several lanes of traffic and into the path of the patrol vehicle entering the freeway, Montiel said.

Both of the men on the motorcycle were transported to Stanford

Hospital, where Grant Coles succumbed to his injuries, Montiel said. Coles suffered major injuries in the crash. The officer sustained minor injuries but did not require medical treatment, Montiel said.
