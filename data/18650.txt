Police shot and killed a man in Prospect Heights on Wednesday morning, about six hours after another man was shot and killed by an officer in Brooklyn, the NYPD said.

The man, identified as 18-year-old Joshua Martino, of Brooklyn, had been firing shots into a lounge moments before police pursued and then confronted him around 3:40 a.m., NYPD Chief Terrence Monahan said at a press briefing.

Two officers shot Martino twice in the torso after he turned towards them with a .38 caliber revolver in his hand, Monahan said. The man never fired and no officers were injured.

Martino was taken to the hospital in cardiac arrest and pronounced dead sometime before 4:30 a.m.

Police said the .38 caliber revolver was recovered at the scene.



Neighbor Sheryl Akin said Martino was a twin, and that she bonded with him over that. She said she's shocked that he's dead and wants to know more about what happened.

"I heard the news and I was devastated, I cried," said Sheryl Akin. "I have a twin sister, and those are nice boys, twin boys. A loss of life is just terrible."

"The last memory of the boy I have, he came upstairs with his twin to give us condolences, to hold us down, because we just lost our older sister," she said. "That says something about him."



No one answered the door at Martino's home when NBC 4 New York knocked Wednesday. Neighbors said he lived there with his mother, twin brother and two younger siblings.

Atlantic Avenue was shut down from Washington to Franklin streets as police investigated before dawn. It reopened late Wednesday afternoon.

In a separate incident, an NYPD officer shot and killed a 63-year-old man holding a knife in Canarsie Tuesday night.
