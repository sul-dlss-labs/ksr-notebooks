One man is dead and two women are hurt from a car crash after Knoxville police officers pursued a vehicle with people they suspect were involved in an April 7 shooting.

At about 6 p.m. on Monday, Knoxville Police Department officers attempted to stop a vehicle in Western Heights, according to a press release.

The occupants were suspected in the shooting that occurred on Keith Avenue on the night of April 7, police said.

The Knox County Sheriff's Office identified the driver as Napoleon J. Moore, 19, of Knoxville.

Moore refused to stop, police say, and officers chased his vehicle until the driver crashed near the intersection of W. Emory Road and Clinton Highway.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene and a female passenger, identified by Knox County Sheriff's Office as 18-year-old Savanna M. Howard of Maynardville, was taken to UT Medical Center with what appeared to be non-life-threatening injuries.

The suspect hit a second vehicle in the crash. That driver, an adult female, was taken to Tennova North with minor injuries. No police officers were hurt.

The Knox County Sheriffâ€™s Office will be conducting an investigation. A Knox County press release says warrants were on file at the time of the incident for both Moore and Howard.
