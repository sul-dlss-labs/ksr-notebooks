UPDATED: 9:58 a.m., Monday:

A man died by suicide after an hours-long standoff in Falls Township’s Levittown section early Monday morning.

Falls Township police Lt. Nelson Whitney confirmed earlier reporting by LevittownNow.com that a man had died following an hours-long standoff. He stated the 47-year-old man was found dead by an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound around 4 a.m.

Officers were called to the home on Thinbark Lane for a husband and wife in a domestic dispute around 11:50 p.m. Sunday. The wife had fled the home and called 9-1-1, reporting her husband was in the home and armed with several firearms, Whitney said.

At the home, officers attempted to get the man to answer the door and the phone. After no success talking to the man, tactical officers were called to the home, the lieutenant said.

“Utilizing an armored vehicle and a loud speaker, attempts were repeatedly made to contact the man inside the house with no success. After approximately four hours, entry was made into the home and the man was found deceased,” Whitney said.

Fire Marshal Rich Dippolito said residents in several homes surrounding the scene were evacuated during the standoff.

Officers from Bensalem and Bristol Township assisted Falls Township police at the scene. The fire marshal’s office and Levittown-Fairless Hills Rescue Squad were also on the scene.
