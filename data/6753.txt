Baltimore County police have identified a Catonsville man fatally shot by an officer after he used pepper spray on another officer and charged at both of them with a machete.

Around 9:20 p.m. on Saturday, two officers responded to a report that 25-year-old Jason William Leary was violently beating his wife at his home in the 6100 block of Edmonson Avenue in Catonsville.

Police say Leary met the officers at the front door and sprayed one officer, then he ran at the officers on the porch with a machete raised toward them. The second officer fired several shots, hitting Leary at least once.

Police say Leary was taken to St. Agnes Hospital, where he died a short time later.

The officers received minor injuries and were treated at the scene. The officer who shot Leary is on administrative leave while an internal investigation into the shooting is conducted.
