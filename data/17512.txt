ST. LOUIS COUNTY • A renter upset over a maintenance problem at his north St. Louis County home set the house on fire Wednesday, then shot and critically wounded a 78-year-old repairman before killing himself, police say.

St. Louis County police were called about 4:10 p.m. to the 800 block of Liberty Village Drive in unincorporated north St. Louis County near Florissant. They found a 78-year-old man inside a home suffering from gunshot wounds. The shooter had fled the block, which is part of the Liberty Green subdivision.

St. Louis County police Sgt. Shawn McGuire said the victim is a maintenance worker for the owner of several rental properties on the street, including the home where the shooter, Triandos Sherrard, 56, lived. McGuire did not identify the victim. He remained hospitalized in critical condition Thursday. He’s expected to survive.

Sherrard and the victim had argued earlier Wednesday about a problem at Sherrard’s home that had not been fixed, McGuire said. Sherrard had also argued with his landlord about it Wednesday. McGuire did not know what issue the argument was about.

After St. Louis County police responded to the shooting, officers were called to another home on the same block for a report of a fire, McGuire said. That turned out to be Sherrard’s home. Police believe he started the fire before shooting the repairman. The home sustained smoke and water damage.

About 30 minutes later, McGuire said, officers were called to a home in the 2000 block of Mcmenamy Drive, about eight miles southeast of Liberty Green, for a report of an attempted suicide. One of Sherrard’s relatives lives at the home on Mcmenamy.

Officers arrived to find Sherrard walking outside a home carrying a handgun. Before officers could talk to him, Sherrard fatally shot himself in the head, McGuire said.
