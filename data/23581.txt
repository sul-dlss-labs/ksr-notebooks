Deceased suspect identified in Forest County officer involved shooting

The man shot by a Forest County Sheriff's deputy Thursday has been identified by the Wisconsin Department of Justice.

31-year-old Brandon O. Cude was shot to death after pointing a shotgun at the sheriff's deputy during a traffic incident.

According to a press release, the deputy responded to a call from a passer-by about a stranded driver. The stranded driver was Cude. After assisting him, the deputy ran a records check which revealed Cude was wanted for two felony warrants for child sexual assault in Texas.

When Cude realized the deputy was aware of the warrants, he pointed a shotgun at the deputy. The deputy fired his weapon in response. Other deputies that arrived to the scene gave first aid to Cude, but he died from his injuries.

The deputy's identity has not been released. He has been placed on administrative leave which is standard protocol.

The incident happened off of Sand Lake Road, in Crandon. The specific intersection is Timber Lane and Valican Shores Lane, near Little Sand Lake.

The Forest County Sheriff's Office is fully cooperating with the Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation.

DCI is continuing to collect evidence and will turn over their reports to the Forest County District Attorney when the investigation is complete.
