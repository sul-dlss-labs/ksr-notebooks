Two Eastern Kentucky law enforcement officers shot and killed a Martin man after being attacked with a knife early Thursday morning.

Kentucky State Police Trooper Isaac Whitaker and Martin police Sgt. Brian Ratliff were responding to a disturbance call at Petry Apartments on Main Street in Martin at about 2:30 a.m., said Trooper Scott Hopkins.

When they arrived, they found James Anthony Rederick, 38, of Martin, standing by his door armed with a knife, Hopkins said.

Rederick attacked Ratliff and both officers drew their weapons, shooting Rederick, Hopkins said.

Rederick was transported to St. Joseph Martin Hospital where he was pronounced dead by the Floyd County coroner, Hopkins said.

Ratliff is expected to recover from the lacerations and other knife wounds he sustained to his neck, Hopkins said. He is listed in good condition at St. Joseph's Martin Hospital.

Whitaker was not injured in the incident and has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation, Hopkins said.
