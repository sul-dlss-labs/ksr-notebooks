ATLANTIC CITY — A city man was shot and killed after stabbing a police officer Friday night during an investigation into a hit and run crash, authorities said.

At 6:30 p.m., police responded to the 600 block of North Kentucky Avenue for a hit-and-run crash with injuries, according to a news release from the Atlantic County Prosecutor’s Office. While they were investigating, Timothy Deal, 32, who was not involved, stabbed an officer in the torso with a knife, the prosecutor’s office said.

It was an unprovoked attack, the release said. The injured officer then fired his weapon, shooting Deal, the release said.

Both the officer and Deal were taken to AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center’s City Campus, where Deal was pronounced dead and the officer was treated and released, the prosecutor’s office said.

An autopsy by the Southern Regional Medical Examiner’s Officer Saturday found Deal died from multiple gunshot wounds.

The officer’s identity was not released.

The investigation is continuing by the county prosecutor’s Major Crimes Unit without resort police, per state guidelines, and will include evidence submitted to the State Police Ballistics Laboratory, the release said.

Anyone with information is asked to call Major Crimes Unit at 609-909-7800, or after hours at 609-909-7200.
