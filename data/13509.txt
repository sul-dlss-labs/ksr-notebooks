Bruce Douglas Graham, a 53-year-old white man, died in a deputy-involved shooting Sunday, Oct. 6, in the 28600 block of Cloverleaf Place in Castaic, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Deputies responded to the location about a “family disturbance call,” which had been updated to a “suicidal man with a gun” call when deputies arrived, according to a news release from the L.A. County Sheriff’s Department.

When deputies arrived, Graham emerged from a garage area holding a rifle. He refused to follow commands, according to the release, and would not drop the rifle. He pointed the rifle at deputies, who then fired at him, according to the release.

A weapon was recovered at the scene, and no deputies were injured.

Graham was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead at 11:27 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

Anyone with information can call the Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
