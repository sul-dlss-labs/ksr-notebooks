LANSING, Ill. (WLS) -- A police officer was wounded and a suspected shoplifter was killed in a shooting outside a south suburban Lansing strip mall Thursday afternoon.

The Lake County Coroner has identified the man killed in the incident as Warren Christian, 43, of East Chicago, Ind. His death was ruled a homicide.

Witnesses said the shootout took place after a man tried to steal meat from an Ultra grocery store near 160th and Torrence. Employees called police, and when officers tried to take the man into custody, police said the man grabbed an officer's gun.

"During the struggle the suspect shot the officer in the lower leg and continued to flee," said Fabian Newman, a spokesperson for the Village of Lansing.

A short chase covered several hundred yards before another police officer shot the suspect.

"Inside the store they told us to go back and don't get near the windows," said Sarah Gonzalez, who was inside a Carson's, not far from where the shooting occurred. "I'm not coming back again, that's for sure."

Investigators are looking at shell casings and likely surveillance video from several stores in this shopping mall.

"We're examining any evidence that we can find," Lansing Police Chief Dennis Murrian Jr. said.

The officer, who appeared to be down on one knee in cellphone video shot by a witness, was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Christian died at an area hospital.

The incident is being investigated by the Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force.
