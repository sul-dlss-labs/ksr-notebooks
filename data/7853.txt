VALLEJO, CA

Tenorio identified the man as Eric Walters. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Vallejo police received a California Highway Patrol 911 transfer call at 6:03 p.m. regarding a man who was depressed, heavily armed and wanting to commit suicide, Tenorio said in a news release.

Walters had several rifles and fired off a single round in his home at 141 Dawson Place before police arrived, Tenorio said. The gunshot was reported by a neighbor and heard by officers several blocks away.

Police spoke to Walters by phone in an attempt to have him surrender peacefully but Walters armed himself with a rifle, exited his garage and confronted the officers, Tenorio said.

Police asked Walters to put the rifle down but instead he raised it and pointed it at the officers, Tenorio said. The officers then shot Walters.

The incident remains under investigation.
