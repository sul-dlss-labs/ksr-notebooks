Police have identified a man shot in a Thursday afternoon raid as a 29-year-old who had an arrest record growing throughout his adult life.

Herbert Earl Harris Jr. was shot by an undercover narcotics detective as officers executed a warrant at an apartment in Cleveland Arms, a tough housing community in Northwest Jacksonville.

Jacksonville Sheriff's Office Chief John Hartley said Friday the department was not identifying the officer who shot Harris because he was working undercover. However, police say the officers who served the warrant were in full tactical garb and clearly identified themselves as the authorities when they forced entry to Apartment 167.

Hartley said the officers went in after first knocking and getting no response. He said Harris was waiting in the hallway with a 9mm pistol in his hand and the narcotics officer fired five rounds from an AR-15 rifle.

Harris had a prosthetic leg, but police were unable to say why.

Harris was not leasing the apartment. Hartley said police are investigating whether to charge a woman who was. He said officers found cocaine and marijuana during the search.

The apartment where Harris was shot was one of two apartments raided as part of a drug investigation Thursday, Hartley said.

In addition to a drug warrant, Hartley said Harris also had an outstanding warrant for an assault in Ohio.

Harris' arrest record dates back to at least 1998 and includes charges ranging from worthless checks to grand theft auto. He also was convicted in a 2003 Clay County gas station robbery.

Hartley said the officer who shot Harris is on standard administrative leave pending an investigation.
