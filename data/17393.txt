A bank robbery in Chandler led to a standoff at a Mesa gas station late Friday morning ending with the suspect committing suicide, officials said.

Chandler police were searching for a suspect in an armed bank robbery that took place at Warner and Alma School roads when officers discovered the suspected robber's vehicle at a gas station in Mesa, said Detective Seth Tyler, a Chandler Police Department spokesman.

Officers contacted the man, who was parked at the gas station at Guadalupe and Country Club roads, Tyler said. When officers approached the man's car, police reported, he emerged with a handgun, leading to the standoff.

"Officers took cover and started negotiation with the suspect," Tyler said. The man then entered his car before "taking his life with a single round from his gun," Tyler said

The standoff lasted 10 to 15 minutes and involved units from Mesa's SWAT team, he added.

Officers did not fire at the man, he said.

The Mesa Police Department will be handling the Mesa side of the investigation, while Chandler investigators will focus on the robbery, Tyler said.

Additional details about the suspect were not readily available.
