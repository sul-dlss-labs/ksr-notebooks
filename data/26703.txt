The Denver Office of the Medical Examiner on Monday publicly identified the man who shot and killed himself last week after a 40-mile police chase ended on Interstate 70.

The medical examiner’s office ruled that Andy Escobar, 18, died from a gunshot wound and that the manner of death was suicide.

Police allege Escobar had a gun and robbed a man’s wallet and keys at a liquor store in Strasburg on Thursday, then fled in his victim’s car. Arapahoe County sheriff’s deputies pursued Escobar on I-70, with speeds exceeding 100 mph at times.

Deputies were able to stop Escobar on I-70 near Washington Street in Denver and ordered him out of the vehicle. When he did not get out, Denver police officers fired less-lethal rounds at him, officials said.

Shortly thereafter, they heard a gunshot in the vehicle and found the suspect with what was described as a self-inflicted wound.

Escobar was taken to Denver Health, where he was pronounced dead.

The incident led to the closure of part of westbound I-70 from Interstate 270 to Washington Street for nearly six hours.
