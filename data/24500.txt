SHIAWASSEE, MI -- One person was killed following a police stop which turned into a chase and ended in a fatal head-on crash on I-69 toward Lansing.

Saginaw police were responding to a call about a female shooting at a male, when both the female and male got into a white Cadillac sedan and drove south toward Shiawassee.

The white Cadillac sedan was pulled over on M-13 near Corunna after being spotted by two Shiawassee sheriff's deputies.

During that time, Michigan State Police Lt. David Kaiser said the female, who was driving, tried to switch places with the male. The woman exited the vehicle and the male took off "very fast."

One deputy stayed behind with his gun drawn until the female was handcuffed while the other deputy followed in pursuit of the male suspect in the white Cadillac sedan.

Going westbound on I-69, the suspect hit a black car in a fatal head-on collision, killing one person. The person killed by the crash was not the suspect and has not yet been identified by police.

The westbound I-69 exit to ramp M-13 exit 123 is closed due to the crash.

The investigation into this incident will be a joint effort by Saginaw Police and Michigan State Police.
