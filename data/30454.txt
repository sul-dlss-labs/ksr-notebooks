Officers responded to a domestic violence call. The suspect reportedly shot himself at the end of a chase.

MARYSVILLE — A man suspected of domestic violence fatally shot himself Thursday night after leading officers on a chase, according to Marysville police.

Officers were initially responding to reports of shots fired in the 4900 block of 88th Street NE, according to a news release.

The suspect reportedly left the scene in a white pickup truck. When an officer saw the truck nearby and tried to stop it, the man kept driving.

An officer performed a PIT maneuver on the truck — a technique in which an officer bumps a corner of a patrol car into the corner of a fleeing vehicle to cause its driver to lose control — stopping it in the 4200 block of 88th Street NE.

As officers approached the truck, they heard a gunshot, according to the news release. The man suffered a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, police said.

Paramedics transported him to Providence Regional Medical Center Everett, where he later died.

His identity, as well as the cause and manner of his death, will be released by the Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office.

The Everett Police Department was asked to conduct an independent investigation. The stretch of road on 88th Street NE was closed Friday morning as Everett detectives processed the scene.

There were no other reports of injuries, either during the pursuit or at the location of the reported domestic violence incident.
