Coroner's officials have identified two men who died at the end of a police chase early Wednesday.





Matthew Allen Orr, 21, and Eric Thomas Johnson, 18, both of Upland, were in a vehicle that crashed off the northbound 15 Freeway at Sierra Avenue in Fontana. Johnson, a passenger in the vehicle, died at the scene, San Bernardino County coroner's officials said.





Orr died at Arrowhead Regional Medical Center in Colton at 5:01 a.m.





Upland police tried to pull over Orr after he was seen speeding near the corner of 15th Street and Victoria Avenue at 2:31 a.m. He fled from police on the eastbound 210 to the northbound 15 and got off the freeway at Sierra Avenue.





He lost control of the 2004 Nissan Sentra, crashed into utility box and then flipped the vehicle.

Police say alcohol may have played a role in the crash.
