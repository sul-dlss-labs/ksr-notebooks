MIAMI BEACH  The grainy video from an outdoor security camera shows Husien Shehada walking through South Beach just after 4 a.m., then stopping and putting his hands in the air. His brother, Samer Shehada, steps beside him  then three gunshots from a police officer off-screen throw Husien Shehada to the sidewalk. “His eyes were still open,” said Samer Shehada, 31. “And when they say you can see the life leaving someone’s eyes, I could see that.”

Four days later, the same officer who shot Husien Shehada, 29  Adam Tavss, a Miami Beach patrolman who had been on the force for three years  was involved in a second shooting. Calls to 911 suggested that each man was armed, but neither appeared to have a weapon when shot. Both later died.

The Miami Beach Police Department and the state attorney’s office are investigating the shootings. But since the first shooting on June 14, the police and lawyers representing the victims’ families have been battling for sympathy with leaks, exaggerations and omissions, and the public struggles with who to blame, who is covering up  and how much to care.

This is a jaded piece of sand. In the past few months, the ShamWow pitchman, Vince Shlomi, was arrested after a fight with a prostitute, and a wide receiver for the Cleveland Browns, Donte Stallworth, pleaded guilty to drunken driving and killing a pedestrian.
