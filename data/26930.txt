Faced with eviction from his Brandywine Hundred home, a man shot himself to death moments after constables told him he had 15 minutes to leave.

The incident unfolded at about 10 a.m. Tuesday in the Winterset Farms development.

Delaware Constables arrived at the home Tuesday morning to serve the eviction notice. After telling the man he had minutes to leave the house, constables heard gunfire, said Master Cpl. Michel Eckerd, a county police spokesman.

Police surrounded the home and had the entrance to the development blocked off, though they were letting residents out.

A next-door neighbor said he was walking out of his home when he saw officers carrying assault-style rifles, and they ordered him to go inside his home.

"Twenty minutes later,‚Äù the man said, "they said to get out of my house."

During the standoff, police in full-body tactical gear lined up outside the home, some crouched behind a car.

An officer could be heard shouting commands to come out with hands up.

Concord High School, which is about half a mile south of Winterset Farms, sent notices to families of students letting them know the school was under a "shelter in place." Unlike in a lockdown, when sheltering in place, school operations continue with students remaining inside the building.

The incident ended about 11:45 a.m. when police entered the home and found the man dead. They said his death was a suicide.
