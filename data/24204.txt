A police chase that led to a crash near downtown San Angelo on Friday evening killed one person and injured three others.

Tracy Gonzalez, public information officer for the San Angelo Police Department, said the chase began about 7 p.m. An anti-crime unit and street crimes division "observed illegal activity concerning the vehicle," a 2005 Dodge Ram, and attempted to pull over the driver, she said.

The driver kept going, and about 7:05 p.m., as the Dodge was eastbound on West Concho Avenue, it ran a red light and collided with a 2013 Chevy Equinox that was southbound on South Abe Street.

The Chevy's driver, an 83-year-old woman, reported no injuries, Gonzalez said. However, all four occupants of the Dodge were extracted from the vehicle and taken to Shannon Medical Center.

A male occupant died of his injuries. It was unclear whether he was the driver or a passenger.

Police turned the investigation over to the Department of Public Safety, which Gonzalez said would be doing scene reconstruction and would have the area blocked for several hours. She advised drivers continue to avoid the area.

The ages and identities of those involved in the crash are not yet available.

Here is the statement Gonzalez gave to media at the scene about 8:45 p.m.:
