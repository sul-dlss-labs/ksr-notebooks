Two young women died Monday morning in a vehicle crash in Vacaville and the driver was arrested following a high-speed pursuit on Interstate 80, a California Highway Patrol official said.

The Solano County Coroner on Tuesday identified the victims as Jaiah Metcalf, 21, of Sacramento; and Alazae Jeffrey, 19, of Elk Grove.

CHP Solano spokesman Dave Harvey identified the driver as Tayshawn Larun Clayton, 21, possibly of Sacramento.

Clayton was arrested, taken to a local hospital for treatment, then transported to Solano County Jail, Harvey said.

Charges were listed as two counts of gross vehicular manslaughter, one count of evading police resulting in serious bodily injury or death and one count of drug-related DUI resulting in bodily injury. Bail was set at $183, 333.
