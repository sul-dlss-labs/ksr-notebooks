A man who was shot Friday night after he used a stun gun on an off-duty police officer has died, police say.

Jefferson Duncan, 32, died at the hospital, said Sgt. Tommy Thompson, a Phoenix Police Department spokesman.

Duncan was with Jonathan Richard Parker, 40, at an apartment complex located at 11050 N. Biltmore Drive, Thompson said.

Two off-duty Phoenix police officers were working as uniformed security guards at the complex. Thompson said Duncan and Parker appeared suspicious and the officers contacted them.

Duncan fled on foot and one of the officers chased him. Thompson said the officer caught Duncan and the men began fighting.

Duncan eventually gave up, Thompson said, and agreed to be taken into custody. But Duncan somehow got the officer's Taser from his belt and used it on the officer, Thompson said.

When the officer recovered, Duncan aimed the Taser at the officer's head and threatened to stun him again if the officer did not release him, Thompson said, adding that the officer pulled his firearm and shot "numerous rounds" at Duncan.

Duncan was taken to the hospital where he later died. Thompson said the officer also went to the hospital for treatment and evaluation.

The officer, who Thompson said is 37-years-old and a five-year veteran of the Phoenix Police Department, will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure for all officer involved shootings.

Thompson said the case will be investigated criminally and internally.

Parker also tried to escape, Thompson said, but the second officer caught him.

Police later learned Parker had outstanding warrants for failure to appear and driving under the influence. He was booked into the Maricopa County Jail, Thompson said.
