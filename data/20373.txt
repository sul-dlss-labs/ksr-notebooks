A man was fatally shot after opening fire on two sheriff’s deputies, who were left injured in the exchange of gunfire late Wednesday in Compton, authorities said.

At around 11:40 p.m. deputies tried to pull over a white sedan in the 900 block of North Santa Fe Avenue.

The car didn’t initially stop, and the deputies could see three people inside the vehicle, according to a news release from the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

After one of the deputies opened the car’s rear passenger door, an armed passenger fired at the deputy, who returned fire. The man then fired on the second deputy, who also returned fire.

The initial gunfire happened as the first deputy was trying to get the man to exit the vehicle, according to sheriff’s Lt. Joe Mendoza.

It’s unclear what prompted the gunman to open fire. He fired at least three rounds before himself being shot, authorities on scene said.

The man, described only as a Hispanic man who was believed to be a local gang member, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. His handgun was found at the scene, the release stated.

Two Hispanic women who were inside the car were detained. One of the rear windows of the car had a shattered window, video showed.

The deputy who was struck by gunfire was wearing a protective vest; he was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive. The second deputy was treated for minor injuries.

Homicide detectives were investigating.
