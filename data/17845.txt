A man was shot and killed by police officers near The Catholic University of America late Monday after he raised a weapon that later was found to be a BB gun, police said.

Sherman Evans, 63, died in a hospital after a confrontation with officers just west of the university, police said. Investigators said they are exploring the possibility that Evans intended to commit "suicide by cop."

Officers were called to the 100 block of Varnum Street NE about 10:30 p.m. On a walkway between two apartment buildings, they found Evans with a gun, police said.

Officers ordered him to drop the gun, but he refused and raised it, police said. The officers opened fire and shot Evans multiple times.

Neighbor Madeline Pautler said she heard the commotion.

"I heard 'Drop the gun! Drop the gun!' and then a little bit of murmuring and maybe a few shouts from the cops, and then, a few seconds later, six gunshots," she said.

Evans was rushed in critical condition to a hospital, where he died. Police then found the weapon he held was a BB gun.

He was in his 60s and lived alone, said Marcus Gant, the manager of his apartment building.

"He was a good guy. He didn't bother anybody," Gant said. "I never would have thought he would do anything like this."

Friends said Evans suffered from depression after his wife died.

The investigation is ongoing. Anyone with information on the incident is asked to call police at 202-727-9099.
