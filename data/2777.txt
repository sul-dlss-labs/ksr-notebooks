The investigation into whether two Rayne police officers were justified in killing a man who had reportedly rammed his car into other vehicles is scheduled to come before a grand jury Monday.

Thirty-year-old Derrick Francis, of Lafayette, was shot and killed shortly after midnight September 7th.

A state police investigation found that Francis was struck by three bullets when the officers fired at him, after a brief chase.

The issue before the grand jury will be whether officers acted appropriately. The panel convenes at 9 a.m.

Jarvis Claiborne, an attorney representing Francis' family, has said that private investigators determined that police could have subdued Francis without the use of deadly force.

District Attorney Mike Harson has declined to discuss the specifics of the state police investigation, but he says it's routine to bring shootings involving police to a grand jury.

The officers are on administrative leave pending the outcome of the case.
