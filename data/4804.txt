Yes, one might miss having the office as an anchor, or the occasional water-cooler chat with colleagues. But 100% remote work doesn't have to be disengaged and disconnected! At Pitch, we put a lot of emphasis on connecting (not just about work!) through virtual coffee chats, catch-ups via Zoom (as and when needed)... and Slack shenanigans. Additionally, we are big fans of team offsites, yearly company get togethers, and Weekly Bulletins (our async alternative to All-Hands). We believe remote working empowers you to work autonomously and flexibly on something you believe in, and your colleagues are only a Slack away for a second opinion, cheering up, and various meme shenanigans.
