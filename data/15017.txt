Man Shoots at Detectives For No Apparent Reason; SWAT Team Gets Involved 0 by Brian Doerr August 28, 2014

According to a police report, on Wednesday, August 27 in Lynwood, South Central LA County, two L.A. Sheriff’s detectives were leaving the location after investigating a residential burglary at the 12200 block of Santa Fe Avenue at around 1:00 in the afternoon.

Then out of nowhere, a resident from the same block came out of his apartment and allegedly shot at the detectives. One of them was hit in the shoulder. The detectives returned fire, and the suspect then fled back into his unit, barricading himself. The Sheriff’s SWAT team was then called to handle the barricade scene.

The suspect continued to fire at deputies several times, while he stayed inside the apartment. After more than two hours, the suspect finally came out of the house with a semi-automatic pistol in his hand. Without hesitation, the SWAT team shot the suspect, killing him instantly.

The suspect was later identified as Kerry Wesson, 45. The detective who was shot initially was listed in stable condition at a local hospital.

There were no reported motives for the alleged shooting by Wesson, and the investigation prior to the shooting was not related to the shooting.
