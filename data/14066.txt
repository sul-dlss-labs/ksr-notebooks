None of the three Baltimore police officers who shot a suspected robber and a suspected burglar Wednesday night have any prior police-involved shootings in their records, Baltimore police said Friday.

Police identified the officer who shot a man as he allegedly left a 7-Eleven store near Mondawmin Mall with a cash register till in his hands as Betavia Elliott, a 24-year veteran of the department. The alleged suspect in that case, who police said was believed to be holding up the store at gunpoint but did not have a weapon, was wounded and later listed in stable condition at a hospital.

In a second incident later on Wednesday night, two officers walked into a southwest Baltimore home to investigate a report of a burglary and found two men inside wearing clothing bearing the word "police." One of the men was armed with a handgun, police said, and two officers fatally shot him after he did not follow orders to drop his weapon. The man who was killed was identified as Bernard Lofton, 22, of Parkville.

The officers involved in that shooting were identified as Aileen Villodas and Hovhannes Simonyan, both with the department since 2012.
