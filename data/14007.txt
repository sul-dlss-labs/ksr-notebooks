PASSAIC — A man arguing with his mother was fatally shot by police after he charged at officers with a knife at a senior citizen housing complex Tuesday night, prosecutors said.

Michael Gabriele was shot once by a Passaic police officer, who responded along with another city officer to a dispute at the Monsignor Joseph R. Brestel Residence on Pennington Avenue around 10:20 p.m., according to Assistant Prosecutor Jason Statuto. Gabriele was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Regional Center around 11:30 p.m.

The responding officers were pointed to an apartment where Gabriele was in a dispute with his mother, a resident at the complex, Statuto said in an email. When officers arrived, Gabriele quickly grabbed a knife from the kitchen, refused orders to drop the weapon and rushed at police before he was shot.

A building resident, who did not give his name, told The Record Gabriele was barred from the complex, but it was not immediately clear why.

Statuto said an investigation by the Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office Shooting Response Team was ongoing and an autopsy was planned Wednesday.
