Tolsie Nohar, a 19-year-old male from 107th Street was traveling in a 2002 Nissan Altima, according to the New York Post, when police said it ran a stop sign after exiting off the Van Wyck Expressway shortly after 1 a.m. Police with the Queens South Task Force pulled the Nissan over and attempted to question the driver when he fled the scene and sped away, the newspaper reported. NYPD regulations discourage high speed chases unless the vehicle is involved in a serious crime, according to police, which led them to follow at regular speeds and ultimately lose sight of the vehicle. A short time later, the Nissan was observed by witnesses striking a wall before crashing through roll down gates and into a loading dock at a factory near the intersection of 121st St. and Liberty Avenue. The car then burst into flames, killing Nohar and seriously injuring the other male in the vehicle, according to witnesses. The Post also reported that it was unclear who was driving the car at the time because it was so mangled and burned following the accident.Police said Nohar was pronounced dead at the scene. The car's other occupant was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died just after 1 a.m. Tuesday. The second passenger did not have any identification with him and his identity had not yet been confirmed. According to the Post, the car had been stolen from Yonkers on Feb. 7, but it was not known if the two killed in the accident stole the car or were driving it after it had been stolen by another party. The crash as well as the car theft were still under investigation, police said.Reach reporter Peter A. Sutters Jr. by e-mail at [email protected] or by phone at 718-229-0300 Ext 173.
