A Southern Indiana police officer who fatally shot a man last week while responding to a domestic disturbance call was justified in his actions, according to officials.

Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull reviewed the Indiana State Police investigation of the April 26 shooting and ruled that Patrolman Tyler Ash of the Clarksville Police Department was justified in using deadly force against Max David Helton, according to Indiana State Police.

Helton, 43, died after Ash, a two-year Clarksville Police Department veteran, shot him as police responded to a 911 call for a domestic disturbance possibly involving a gun at a residence in the 500 block of West Howard Street in Clarksville, according to state police.

Officers saw a man with a gun at the doorway of the residence. The man then retreated into the house and barricaded himself and the original 911 caller inside, according to state police.

Officers eventually encountered the man, identified as Helton, who was still holding a handgun.

Helton refused commands to drop the weapon, and at least one Clarksville police officer fired at and struck Helton, according to Indiana State Police.

Officers gave first aid to Helton, who was transported to University of Louisville Hospital, where he later died, according to state police.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office listed the cause of death as a gunshot wound to the chest.

Mull's review concluded that "Officer Ash properly used deadly force after Helton pointed a firearm at the officer and after being instructed multiple times to drop the weapon," according to Indiana State Police.
