A Pontiac man is facing charges for the armed robbery of a Salvation Army store during which another suspect was shot and killed by a police officer. Cornell Clinton Perry, 21, has been arraigned on two counts of armed robbery, one count of carjacking and two felony firearms offenses. Authorities said Perry and 30-year-old Sean Samuel Coats, of Pontiac, were involved in the Saturday evening robbery of a Salvation Army store in the 600 block of Opdyke Road. Police were called about 8:54 p.m. after one of the men entered the store, showed a handgun and demanded money from an employee. Auburn Hills Police Lt. Casimir Miarka said a responding officer located the suspect vehicle, a Buick Rendezvous, outside the store. Coats had just stepped out of it when he was confronted by an officer and the shooting occurred. Perry fled. He attempted to carjack a 47-year-old Southfield resident who was parked by the Clinton River Trial near Opdyke and Hempstead roads, according to police. Perry was arrested in a nearby wooded area. At Perryâ€™s arraignment Monday, 52-3 District Court Magistrate Marie Soma set his bond at $2 million. He is due back in court July 15 for a pre-exam conference. Armed robbery and carjacking are felonies punishable by up to life in prison. Police said Coats had a history of run-ins with law enforcement and was wanted for violating parole related to a previous armed robbery conviction. The officer involved in the shooting was placed on administrative leave, which is common practice. Contact staff writer Ann Zaniewski at (248) 745-4628 or ann.zaniewski@oakpress.com.
