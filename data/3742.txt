CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas (AP) - A retired police officer was killed while trying to subdue a fleeing bank robbery suspect, who also was shot and killed in the incident.

Winston "Larry" Breeding Jr., 60, died Tuesday after he was shot in a struggle with 34-year-old Derrick McLinn, Assistant Police Chief Ken Bung said Wednesday.

Police had pulled over McLinn and another man for the robbery at the Bank of Alice at about 1:30 p.m.

McLinn was fleeing when Breeding, a retired Arlington police officer and Harris County deputy constable, saw the incident and tried to head off the man with his van.

McLinn brandished a gun and tried to pull Breeding from the van, leading to a struggle in which Breeding was shot several times, Bung said.

A police officer following on foot then fatally shot McLinn, Bung said.

The other man was not charged and the stolen money was recovered.

"Our heart simply goes out to Mr. Breeding," Bung said.
