Crime & Safety Armed Standoff Ends In Suicide: Washington Township Police Police found the suspect dead after a 24-hour standoff. Reply

WASHINGTON TWP, MORRIS, NJ â€” An accused armed robber was found dead in his apartment Wednesday, following a 24-hour standoff with police, Washington Township Police said in a statement. Police said the gunshot wound was self-inflicted.

The standoff began as an investigation into a July 17 armed robbery, Washington Twp. Lt. Douglas Compton said. A robbery with a handgun was reported near the Hastings Square complex around 10 p.m. that night. Using police K-9s, officers tracked the suspect in the robbery, James Appis, to his Wimbledon-area home. He was charged with armed robbery in relation to the incident.

During the next 24 hours, police made multiple attempts to get Appis to exit his home. After repeated attempts failed, police entered the apartment, where they say they found Appis dead from a single gunshot wound. Multiple types of guns and ammunition were found in Appis' home, which police officers secured, Compton said.

The Morris County Sheriff's Department and Prosecutor's Office both assisted, Washington Township police said. "We would also like to thank the Hastings Square Community for supporting our efforts and for assisting us with bringing this incident to an end with no law enforcement or civilians getting hurt," said Compton.
