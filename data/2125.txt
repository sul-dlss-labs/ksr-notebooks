Man dies after chase and crash in Cedar Rapids

Cedar Rapids police have identified a man who died after a chase and crash in a stolen mini-van. Police say 25-year-old Lynne Delane Simpson was driving the van when it crashed early Sunday morning. A Cedar Rapids police helicopter had spotted the car driving at a high rate of speed on Interstate 80, and asked officers on the ground to try and stop it. The van failed to stop and led officers on a high-speed chase into Iowa County before Simpson lost control and the van rolled into a farm field. Simpson was thrown from the van and was pronounced dead at the scene. The van had been reported stolen in Cedar Rapids.
