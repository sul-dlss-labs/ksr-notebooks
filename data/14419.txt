Authorities on Friday identified a 28-year-old man, wanted on drug charges, who died in a crash while El Cajon police pursued him last week.

Derrell Eugene Love, of Escondido, died of blunt force injuries to his head and torso, the Medical Examiner’s Office said.

On April 29, an officer tried to pull over the driver of a Honda Accord for not having a front license plate, investigators said. Instead of stopping, the driver sped west on East Madison Avenue about 3:25 a.m.

A minute later, the officer saw the Honda slam into the back of an empty, parked vehicle. The driver, Love, was thrown from car and died despite a medic’s efforts to revive him, police said.

The reason Love tried to get away isn’t known, but it may be because he had two warrants issued for his arrest, for drug possession, police Lt. Mike Moulton said. The Honda had not been stolen.

Superior Court online records show Love had been charged in crime cases in 2005, 2009 and 2011. Details were not available.
