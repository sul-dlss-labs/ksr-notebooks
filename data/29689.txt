According to police, Hernandez was assaulting a 24-year-old woman with "a blunt instrument." That victim was identified as 24-year-old Chynaa Cardena, who is transgender and from Arkansas.

Police say Hernandez was given commands to stop but allegedly kept assaulting the woman, so the New Wilmington Police officer shot and killed him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Cardena was taken to the hospital where she later died.
