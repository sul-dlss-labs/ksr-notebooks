South Dakota’s attorney general says the shooting of Abraham Fryer by a Pennington County deputy at a traffic stop Feb. 26 was “justified.”

Thursday, the state released the summary on the shooting following an investigation by the Division of Criminal Investigations.

According to the Pennington County Sheriff’s Office, Deputy Robert Schoeberl tried to stop Fryer driving erratically near Concourse Drive and Elk Vale Road; but Fryer kept going.

Fryer finally stopped on Twilight Drive where Schoeberl told him to get out of the SUV and go to the patrol car. That’s when Schoeberl said he noticed that Fryer had a knife on him. As Schoeberl started a search for more weapons, Fryer got back into his SUV.

When the officer reached into the car, Fryer sped off, with Schoeberl standing on the vehicle’s running board.

After several attempts to get Fryer to stop, the deputy fired his handgun nine times, hitting Fryer with six rounds. The 35year-old Fryer died at the hospital.

Fryer also had a semi-automatic handgun on him. The gun had been stolen earlier in the month in Belle Fourche. Also on Fryer at the time was a set of brass knuckles and a baggie of methamphetamine.

In the SUV police found more meth, marijuana, $3,400, a box of ammunition and various items of drug paraphernalia.

At the time of the traffic stop, Fryer was wanted on a federal probation violation as well as having active arrest warrants related to drug charges.

In January 2016, Sturgis police arrested Fryer with about 50 grams of meth and about $13,450.
