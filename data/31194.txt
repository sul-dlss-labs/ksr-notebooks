VAN NUYS (CBSLA) - Officials with the Los Angeles Police Department confirmed that a fatal officer involved shooting occurred Sunday in Van Nuys.

Just before 5:30 p.m. officers responded to reports of a man with a knife, who was reportedly slashing car tires on Victory Boulevard near Ranchito Avenue.

When officers arrived, they say the suspect approached them carrying bloody knives in both hands.

"In an attempt to get this situation to a peaceful conclusion, the suspect failed to comply with the officers orders to drop the knife and at some point, the suspect advanced toward the officers. Less lethal munitions were used, including a 40mm foam-round, and an officer-involved shooting occurred," said Sgt. Bruce Borihanh with LAPD.

The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

No officers were injured during the incident.
