COLUMBUS, Ohio - A man was fatally shot Thursday evening by Columbus police after confronting the officers with a gun, police said.

Kawme Dejuan Patrick, 25, was shot about 7:45 p.m. Thursday, Columbus police said Friday in a post on the department's Facebook page. He was taken to Grant Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead about one hour later.

The shooting took place after Columbus police responded to a call of a man with a gun on the 1100 block of Lockhurst Road at the Lockhurst Village Apartments, police said. The patrol officers involved said they saw an armed man -- Patrick -- standing on the building's lawn.

The officers - Linda Gutierrez and Cassie Scott - said Patrick matched the description of the suspect. The officers confronted Patrick, which led to several shots being fired, police said.

It's unclear if Patrick threatened the officers with his weapon.

Gutierrez and Scott are 8-year veterans of the Columbus police department, and they're both assigned to the patrol unit, police said.

The shooting remains under investigation by the Columbus police's Critical Incident Response Team, a special team comprised of select homicide detectives, police said Friday. The officers involved will undergo mandated counseling and may take time off if needed.

Patrick had previous convictions in Franklin County Common Pleas Court, records show. He pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in 2009 and was sentenced to three years of community control. However, he violated his control requirements when he was arrested and pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery in 2011. He was sentenced to a total of two years in prison for both convictions.
