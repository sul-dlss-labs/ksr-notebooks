Maria Ruvalcaba, a 29-year-old Latina, was shot and killed by police Friday, July 22, in the 300 block of East Ann Street in Chinatown, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Ed Winter, spokesman for the coroner's office, said authorities responded to a call regarding a violent female about 5 p.m.

When officials arrived, they found Ruvalcaba locked inside a bathroom. Police advised her to come out, but when she did, she was wielding a knife, Winter said.

Ruvalcaba then lunged at an officer. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred, he said.

The woman was taken to a hospital; however she died less than an hour later from multiple gunshot wounds.

Winter had no other details about the case.

Anyone with information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
