An investigation of a fatal shooting by a police officer in Brooklyn on Jan. 2 has been stymied by a lack of witnesses with a clear view of the officer at the instant of the shooting, according to several law enforcement officials.

Prosecutors from the office of the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, and investigators from the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau, who are investigating the shooting on the afternoon of Jan. 2 in Bensonhurst, have said that they think the officer may have discharged his weapon by accident, either as he banged on a window of a minivan with his pistol or as the minivan jostled him.

But officials from both agencies said more investigative work needed to be done before prosecutors presented evidence to a grand jury, as is standard in fatal police shootings.

The Brooklyn shooting was one of four fatal police shootings that occurred in the first two days of the new year. Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly has said that preliminary investigations found that the other three appeared justified.
