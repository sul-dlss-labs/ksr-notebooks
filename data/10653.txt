Julio Sandoval, a 47-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Sunday, Oct. 9, in the 7300 block of Vineland Avenue in Sun Valley, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Los Angeles police officers responded to a report of someone shooting in the air about 5 a.m. and confronted Sandoval, authorities said.

Sandoval reportedly pointed a rifle at the officers, who fired on him. He died at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. No officers were hurt.

Family members told KTLA-TV (Channel 5) that Sandoval had been distraught the night before and called police himself, saying he was carrying a gun. They believe Sandoval may have been trying to commit suicide by cop,

Sandovalâ€™s son said the gun he aimed at officers was a BB gun.

"The whole time I'm just yelling, 'Stop, my dad's just drunk, he's got a BB gun!" the son told KTLA.

Los Angeles police Capt. Peter Whittingham said he could not confirm reports that Sandoval had called police himself or that the weapon was a BB gun.

Anyone with additional information about the shooting is asked to contact the Los Angeles Police Department at (877) LAPD-24-7 (877) 527-3247. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800) 222-8477.
