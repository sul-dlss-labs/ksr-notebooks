Raul Castillo Razo, a 15-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police officers on Monday, April 27, in the 11300 block of Firestone Boulevard in Norwalk, according to authorities.

The officers, identified by the LAPD as Erick Hernandez and Orlando Diaz, were parked in a Stater Brothers lot when they saw Raul "chasing someone with a gun and firing shots," according to a police news release.

Hernandez and Diaz, who are part of a Criminal Surveillance Team, got out of their car and ordered Raul to stop, the statement said. At that time, he turned the gun on the officers, said Ed Winter, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

The officers were not wounded in the shooting and the individual that officers said Raul was firing at left the area and was not identified, authorities said. Police recovered a .45-caliber handgun allegedly used by Raul at the scene.

Hernandez has been an LAPD officer for more than three years and Diaz is a 10-year veteran. The shooting is under investigation by the LAPD Force Investigation Division and the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department.
