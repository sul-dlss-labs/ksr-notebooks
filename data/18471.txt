CHICAGO — A Chicago police sergeant shot and killed 19-year-old Kajuan Raye during a foot chase in the West Englewood neighborhood Wednesday night.

According to police, they were responding to a call of a battery in progress around 11 p.m. Wednesday when a police sergeant saw a man matching the suspect’s description. When the sergeant said he was an officer, police say, Raye ran off. During the ensuing foot chase, the sergeant says Raye pointed a weapon at him twice, and he opened fire in an alley along the 6500 block of South Marshfield.

Ray died at Advocate Christ Hospital of a single gunshot wound to the abdomen.

A relative told WGN News they were standing with Ray, who’s originally of Dolton, IL, at a bus stop when a police squad car pulled up. Raye’s cousin says he fled, but he was unarmed. Police said Thursday they have been unable to find a weapon after an extensive search.

Police superintendent Eddie Johnson is asking for patience as detectives investigate, giving a brief statement and taking no questions at an afternoon press conference at police headquarters Thursday. Johnson said there is video from a nearby church. The sergeant is on desk duty for at least 30 days as they investigate.

The Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA) has taken over the investigation since this involved a deadly police shooting. Activists say they have no faith in the superintendent or an IPRA investigation.

“It’s the same old thing. A young black man is killed and they can’t find a gun,” activist Eric Russell said. “Why does this keep happening again and again?”
