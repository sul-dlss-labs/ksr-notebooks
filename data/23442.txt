Baltimore Police have identified the victim and officer in a fatal police-involved shooting that occurred last week in Upper Fells Point.

Officer Karen Crisafulli, a five-year veteran, "encountered the suspect after she went to the front of the residence, and he advanced toward her in an aggressive manner," according to police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi.

He said Crisafulli, who has not been involved in any prior shootings, suffered minor abrasions to her hand and arm, though he could not say how those injuries were inflicted. Guglielmi said that a bolt cutter and wrench were found in Fitzgerald's possession.

The shooting occurred near the Cristo Rey Jesuit School as school was letting out. It's the fifth police-involved shooting in Baltimore this year and the fourth in which the victim was killed.
