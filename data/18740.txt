Jorge Victor, a 33-year-old Latino, died Sunday, Jan. 22, after he was shot by police in the 2700 block of East 220th St. in Carson, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 10:50 p.m. on Jan. 21, Long Beach police responded to report about gunshots in the 900 block of Via Wanda, according to a news release. They found a man with a gunshot wound to the chest. He was taken to a local hospital in critical condition and later released.

Gang enforcement detectives looked for the gunman through the night. About 11 a.m. on Jan. 22, detectives identified Victor as the gunman and went to his house in Carson.

As SWAT officers approached the home, Victor fled out the back and jumped multiple fences.

Victor forced his way into a family's home on the same block. Several members of the family escaped, but two minors were still inside.

The SWAT officers entered, and Victor fled out the back, over a fence and into the yard of a different house, where he hid in a shed.

SWAT officers tried to get Victor to surrender but he refused. Officers then tried to subdue Victor with rubber bullets as well as tear gas, but he did not surrender.

About 5 p.m., Victor, armed with a handgun, confronted SWAT officers, two of whom opened fire. Long Beach police identified the officers as Todd Neveling, who became an officer in 2006, and Gabriel Garrido, who was hired in 2003.

Victor was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:20 p.m., according to coroner’s records. A handgun was recovered at the scene.

The Los Angeles County district attorney’s office is conducting an investigation of the shooting, as it does with all officer-involved shootings. Long Beach police are also investigating.
