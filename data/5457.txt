A West Frankfort man involved in a high-speed pursuit with police Wednesday afternoon died Thursday in a Cape Girardeau hospital.

Franklin County Sheriff Bill Wilson said Jeffery McElyea, 22, died just after 9 a.m. from injuries incurred during the pursuit. McElyea was speeding toward a partial roadblock when deputies fired shots at his vehicle's tires.

The truck McElyea was driving then ran off the roadway and overturned.

When he was removed from the vehicle, deputies discovered a gunshot wound to his head, apparently self-inflicted.

McElyea was sought by police after an armed robbery at Benton Farm Fresh at about 11 a.m. Wednesday. Police believe McElyea was the suspect who entered the store, pulled a gun and demanded money from the employees.

A description of the truck McElyea was driving was broadcast to area police agencies and it was soon spotted by deputies as it was traveling on South McLeansboro Street.

Wilson said McElyea slowed the vehicle, then leaned out the window and fired several shots at the squad cars behind him. As he slowed down, a passenger in the car, Mark A. Combs, 22, also of West Frankfort, jumped out of the vehicle and turned himself into police. Combs was taken into custody.

Shortly after, McElyea encountered the roadblock and crashed the truck which had been reported stolen in West Frankfort on Monday. A .22 caliber revolver was recovered from the vehicle.

Law enforcement in two counties are investigating whether or not the two men were involved in an incident that occurred in Johnson County Tuesday night. Wilson said some items taken at gunpoint from three women outside Busby Chapel Freewill Baptist Church were found in the truck after it crashed in rural Benton.

Law enforcement in both counties, as well as the state police, are investigating the two incidents. Formal charges against Combs are pending.
