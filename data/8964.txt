Hufstedler reported: Investigators assigned to the Robbery Division received information about a robbery being planned near the 1200 block of Oak Meadows. Robbery investigators, with the assistance of Tactical Operations officers, set up surveillance on the location early Saturday morning. During that time, five suspects were seen walking through a vacant field, carrying weapons. The suspects approached an area occupied by Officers Hamala and Pisaro. Four suspects fled the location on foot, but the fifth (Rosalio Ledesma) began approaching the officers, pointing his weapon at them. The officers, fearing for their safeties, discharged their duty weapons. Ledesma was pronounced dead at the scene. The four suspects who fled were taken into custody a short time later. Additional suspects involved in the planning of the robbery were also taken into custody. As is customary in HPD officer-involved shooting incidents in the city limits, this case will be investigated by the Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, as well as the Harris County District Attorneyâ€™s Office.
