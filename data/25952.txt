PORTLAND, Ore. â€” Portland police officers were justified in shooting and killing a man who stabbed four people at a Southeast Portland home in April, a Multnomah County grand jury ruled.

Jeb Colin Brock, 42, died at the scene after police found four people with stab wounds.

The incident began in the early morning hours of April 29. Officers were dispatched at 4:14 a.m. to the 13100 block of Southeast Center Street. As they arrived at the home, they saw two stabbing victims outside, Portland police said. They went into the house and found a third stabbing victim.

Officers then found Brock holding a knife to a woman's throat, with an 18-month-old child also in the room, police said. Officers safely removed the child, then addressed Brock.

Sgt. James Mooney and Officer Michael Gonzalez fired their weapons at Brock, killing him.

The four stabbing victims, three men and a woman, were taken to a hospital with "substantial" injuries.

The adults all knew each other.
