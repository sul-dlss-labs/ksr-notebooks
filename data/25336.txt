One man was killed and his brother hurt in a wreck as they fled police in Conyers early Saturday morning.

Conyers Police said they initially responded to reports of a stolen vehicle near the Walmart on Dogwood Drive shortly after 4 a.m.

Three officers attempted to box the vehicle in at the Walmart parking lot, but were unsuccessful. The 2018 Toyota Corolla, which was reported stolen from Virginia, was able to get around the officers and head eastbound on Dogwood Drive toward Salem Road.

The car, driven by 19-year-old Demetris Taylor, sped in excess of 100 mph down Dogwood Drive, according to Rockdale County Sheriff's Deputies who clocked the vehicle from the oncoming lane.

According to Conyers Police Sgt. Kim Lucas, Taylor turned off the lights on the Corolla in an attempt to get away from officers.

Due to unsafe conditions, officers backed off of their chase in strict adherence to Conyers Police policy.

Conyers officers lost sight of the car as it approached Salem Road.

According to Lucas, Taylor lost control of the Corolla on a curve near Leer Trucking and hit a tree on the shoulder of the roadway.

Taylor was pronounced dead at the scene. His brother, 23-year-old Lyndell Taylor, was transported to Atlanta Medical Center with minor injuries.

Investigators found Lyndell Taylor in possession of marijuana and a handgun. He was also wanted in Virginia for failure to register as a sex offender. He is facing drug and firearm charges since he is a convicted felon.
