Steve Rombeau, a 22-year-old white man, was fatally shot by police Wednesday, Oct. 17, in the 15500 block of Vanowen Street in Van Nuys, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Police said patrol officers attempted to stop Rombeau near Roscoe Boulevard and Coldwater Canyon Avenue in Sun Valley for a red-light violation Wednesday evening.

At that point, Rombeau drew a gun and began shooting at them, officials said. He then led police on a 5-mile chase, continuing to shoot at them, police said.

The chase ended near Vanowen Street and Orion Avenue, when Rombeau got out of his vehicle and began firing at officers, police said. Multiple officers returned fire and Rombeau was hit and killed.

A woman who was in the car with Rombeau was shot in the arm, but she did not suffer life-threatening injuries.

Anyone with additional information about the shooting is asked to contact the Los Angeles Police Department at (877) 275-5273. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
