A man police believe shot and killed three people before exchanging gunfire with police last week in Phoenix died from self-inflicted wounds, police said Thursday.

Edward Hallinan, 39, died after confronting officers responding to a domestic violence call in a west Phoenix neighborhood on Feb. 21.

At the time, Phoenix police said an officer fired at the man, but investigators were not sure whether that caused his death or he had fired his own gun.

Police discovered three men in the neighborhood had been found dead and suspect Hallinan was involved. they were identified as Francisco Javier Galindo, 21, Vidal Hernandez-Gutierrez, 26, and Manuel Francisco Rodriguez Jimenez, 50.

Police received a call from the suspect's wife reporting her husband, "had a rifle and was firing shots.''

As officers were setting up outside a home located at 3600 West Lewis Avenue, near 35th Avenue and Thomas Road, Hallinan drove by the officers and stopped in the street, police said.

Officers then heard a gunshot from within the suspect's truck. Officers began yelling commands at the driver to drop his weapon, according to police.

Phoenix police Officer, Ronaldo Canilao, 47, with 17-years of experience, fired a shot at Hallinan, police said.

Hallinan was extracted from his truck and taken to a local hospital where he was later pronounced deceased, police said.
