The driver of a stolen vehicle, who was wanted in connection with a shooting, was killed and his passenger critically injured after they crashed into the back of a fire engine during a police pursuit in South Los Angeles Wednesday.

Officers were at the scene of a shooting when the suspects fled and then crashed into the fire engine, sending the engine into a nearby lawn, Los Angeles Police Department officials said. The stolen van's driver died at the scene of the crash and a passenger suffered critical injuries.

Police have confirmed the driver and passenger in the van, reported stolen about two months ago, were both suspected of committing assault with a deadly weapon.

Witnesses said the fire engine was turning a corner when the van, which did not have its headlights on, slammed into it at high speed. Fernado Luis said he saw a "big ball of smoke."

Two firefighters suffered minor injuries in the collision, and have since been released from hospital. The fire engine, which weighs about 40,000 when loaded with fuel and water, was heavily damaged.

"It was basically thrown around like a toy," said LAFD spokesman Peter Sanders. "This is a very forunate situation for the LA City Fire Department, a very tragic situation for the individuals being chased by the LAPD."

Firefighters were still working to extract two people from the car at 9:30 p.m. in the 100 block of 84th Street, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.

A witness said the van went up in flames upon impact. Firefighters got out of the engine and started battling the flames.

The firefighters were at the location on a separate call for help, officials said.
