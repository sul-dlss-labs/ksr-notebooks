LEXINGTON COUNTY, SC (WIS) - Authorities said the man who died after being shot by a deputy Monday afternoon was a former county fire chief.



Lexington County Coroner Harry O. Harman said 71-year-old Wilmon L. Hutto, Jr. died from blood loss due to a gunshot wound.



Hutto was retired from Lexington County Fire Services where he served as a chief.



According to a news release from the Lexington County Sheriff's Department, a deputy was dispatched to a home on Mineral Springs Road around 1 p.m. after somebody reported shots had been fired.



When 33-year-old deputy Billy Womble arrived, he was met by Hutto, who pointed a gun at the deputy and threatened to fire, according to Sheriff James R. Metts.



Metts said that's when Womble fired his service weapon at Hutto.



Hutto later died.

Hutto worked for Lexington County from 1977 until he retired in 2003. The County Administrator says he was assigned to the Oak Grove Fire Station in the early 1990's when the Pine Grove Fire Station was built, and he oversaw operations of both stations until he retired.

County Administrator Joe Mergo said Hutto's title was one of five career station chiefs in the county.

Womble, who has been with the department for 12 years, was placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation, Metts said.



SLED is investigating the incident.
