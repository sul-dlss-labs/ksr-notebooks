A 29-year-old man at a special needs facility on Long Island died after police shot him with a stun gun when he fought them as they tried to take him to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation, authorities said.



Staff at the Maryhaven Center of Hope in Middle Island called police Wednesday night to report Dainell Simmons, a resident at the facility, had become violent and uncontrollable, officials said.

Police say he had been striking staff members and had been running around the facility, hurling himself at the walls, for nearly 45 minutes before police were called.



When officers arrived to take Simmons to the hospital, police say he lashed out at them and they used a stun gun and pepper spray to subdue him. During the struggle, Simmons become unresponsive and was taken to the hospital, where he died.



Multiple police officers were treated at the hospital for injuries they sustained during the struggle with Simmons.

Detective Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick said "they did their best in a difficult situation."



An autopsy will be conducted on Simmons to determine how he died.
