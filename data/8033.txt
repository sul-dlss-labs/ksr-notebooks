Investigators say a woman who jumped from her husband’s pickup truck while fleeing sheriff’s deputies in the Mojave Desert was apparently killed when she was run over by the pickup and a squad car.

San Bernardino County sheriff’s investigators say 46-year-old Elisa Cedeno’s body was found Monday seven hours after her 49-year-old husband Martin Cedeno was arrested at the end of the nighttime chase on dirt roads.

The California Highway Patrol says Elisa Cedeno was apparently struck by the pickup and the sheriff’s patrol car during the chase in Phelan, a desert community 18 miles west of Victorville.
