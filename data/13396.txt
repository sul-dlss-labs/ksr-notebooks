A 66-year-old Menifee man who shot and killed by police last week has been identified by the coroner's office.



John Schultz was shot at 5:18 p.m. Sept. 12 in the 27500 block of Medford Way in Menifee and was pronounced dead minutes later, at 5:23 p.m., according to the Riverside County Coroner's Office.



On that day, Shultz was allegedly suicidal and armed with handgun, according to Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Sgt. Lisa McConnell. He ignored orders to drop the weapon by officers from the Menifee Police Department, she said.
