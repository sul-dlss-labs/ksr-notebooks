Victim dies after West Philadelphia hit-and-run seen on video; no arrests

WEST PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- The victim of a hit-and-run in West Philadelphia earlier this month, that was caught on video, has died.

Byron Scales was a 30-year-old father of two from North Philadelphia, and was also deaf.

He had been hospitalized since the crash at 59th and Market streets back on December 1st.

So far, no arrests have been made in this case, though police recovered a silver Volvo station wagon the day after Scales was hit.

Police found it on the 800 block of S. Cecil Street after getting a tip call. The car had a shattered windshield.

Investigators are trying to determine who was driving the car at the time.

Surveillance video obtained by Action News showed Scales being hit, and the Volvo appears to be the same car in surveillance video.

Bystanders raced to Scales' rescue after he was hit and a police patrol car arrived with its lights flashing just 11 seconds later.

Police say the officers in the car had tried to stop the Volvo a few blocks back because its taillights were out.

The car sped off and police say the officers disengaged.

They saw the accident from a block away and rushed the victim to the hospital.
