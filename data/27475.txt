HERNANDO COUNTY, Fla. — A deputy and a victim were injured after a deputy-involved shooting in Hernando County on Saturday.

The sheriff's office said at 2:33 p.m., deputies were dispatched to the 5000 block of Golf Club Lane in Spring Hill regarding a weapons disturbance.

The 911 caller told the operator that a family member had a firearm and was threatening other family members with it. Almost immediately, the caller told the operator that the suspect was firing the weapon inside the home.

At some point before the first deputy arrived, the suspect shot a family member inside the home, not the caller.

The first unit arrived on scene at 2:36 p.m. He requested the dispatcher to direct the caller and any other family member to step outside.

At 2:37 p.m., as the deputy began to exit his vehicle, the suspect began firing at the deputy from inside the home through the window. The deputy took cover in the neighbor's garage and returned fire.

During the fire exchange, the deputy was "pinned down" and unable to move to any other location.

The suspect quickly exited the home through the front door and continued to shoot at the deputy.

The deputy advised numerous times over the radio that the shots were being fired and he needed more units.

The suspect continued to fire at the deputy.

At 2:39 p.m., the deputy advised the dispatched that he believed the suspect was "down."

The deputy was treated on scene by the Hernando County Fire Rescue for injuries he received while attempting to avoid being struck by the suspect's gunfire.

“It’s really by the grace of God that he wasn’t hurt because he was at a significant disadvantage for several minutes,” said Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis

The family member who was shot by the suspect was flown to a local trauma center. His condition is unknown at this time, but Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said that victim is expected to survive.

The suspect was killed.

This is an ongoing investigation.
