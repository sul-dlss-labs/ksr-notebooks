A person died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a foot chase with the police, according to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department.

Police say that plain clothes officers observed three individuals behaving in a suspicious manner in and around a vehicle. Upon approach, one man took off in the vehicle, one person immediately surrendered, and another man took off running while holding a gun to his head.

He was identified as 40-year-old Robert Adams. The Clark County coroner ruled his death a suicide.

Approximately 150 yards away the gun discharged.

The incident was reported at 7:58 p.m. It happened in a Walmart parking lot near Tropicana Avenue and Mojave Road.
