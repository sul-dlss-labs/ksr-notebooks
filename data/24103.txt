Carlos Deone High, 37, died during the confrontation Monday near the Ikea store on Mayfield Road.

Police had approached High's vehicle for a welfare check around 1:30 p.m. after a 911 caller reported seeing a man slumped over in the car. When they saw that he had pulled out a rifle, they unholstered their guns and nonlethal weapons and attempted to negotiate for High to put his hands in the air.

Grand Prairie Police Chief Steve Dye said Monday that High had fired at officers and, fearing for their lives, they fired back.

On Wednesday, police said that "investigators have been unable to locate any evidence the decedent fired his rifle despite initial witness accounts that were immediately shared by Chief Dye."

Evidence from the scene, including video footage, did confirm that High pointed the weapon — which police referred to as an assault rifle — at officers at least three times before the officers used deadly force.

Investigators also confirmed that High ignored verbal commands to lower the weapon, police said, and that at least one officer fired a stun gun, which was ineffective because it hit High's rifle.

Authorities are conducting tests to determine whether there was gunshot residue on High's hands.

High's criminal history included convictions for drug possession, as well as for carrying a weapon in a prohibited place and recklessly discharging a firearm. On April 9, he was arrested on a marijuana charge in Tarrant County.

All the officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave, routine in police shootings.

Police said Ikea's customers, who were taken to a secure area in the building, were not at risk.
