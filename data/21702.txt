RARITAN TOWNSHIP, N.J., Oct. 6 - After finding a retired couple dead in their split-level ranch here early Wednesday, the police shot and killed their son during a confrontation at the scene, the Hunterdon County prosecutor's office said.

The couple were identified as Frederick Gobillot, 69, and Jeanne Gobillot, 67. Their bodies were found by Raritan Township police officers after an early morning phone call reported a double homicide.

At the house on Madison Avenue, a suburban street, the police said they found one of the couple's seven children, Steven Gobillot, 36, who was shot twice during what the prosecutor's statement called an altercation with the officers. No further details about the confrontation were released. Mr. Gobillot, said by the authorities to be a possible suspect in the killing of his parents, was airlifted from the home to the Robert Wood Johnson Hospital, where he was declared dead shortly after 8:30 a.m.

Neighbors said yesterday that Mr. Gobillot, a construction worker, was visiting from Hawthorn Woods, Ill. Leslie Schultz, a friend of the family for decades, said Mr. Gobillot was the family's youngest child, was married and had three children, including an infant.
