UPDATE: Lafayette Police have confirmed that the subject inside the home on Jefferson St. was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after the SWAT Team made entry to the residence.

According to a release from LPD, officers responded to a call of shots fired at a residence in the 500 block of Jefferson St. at 12:07 p.m. Thursday. A 32-year-old male victim told police he was shot by his ex-boyfriend. He was transported to a local hospital in stable condition and has since been released.

Officers were told upon arrival that the suspect was still inside the residence. Police say the LPD Swat Team and Crisis Negotiator Team responded and negotiations for the suspect's surrender began. On scene, KATC's Chris Welty could hear law enforcement attempt to make contact with the subject over a loud speaker; police gave the person a number to call to speak with officers. The subject's family was also called to the scene to try and negotiate a surrender.

After several hours of negotiations with no response, the SWAT Team made entry to the residence and located the suspect suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to LPD. He has been identified as 64-year-old Malcolm J. Hymel of Lafayette.

The circumstances surrounding the incident are currently under investigation.

Two schools in the area took necessary precautions as the incident played out. LPSS told KATC that Baranco Elementary was placed on soft lock down for a short time because of its proximity to the incident. However, once police arrived and established a perimeter, the school was deemed safe and operations resumed as usual shortly after.

St. Genevieve Catholic School was also on soft lock down while the situation was ongoing.
