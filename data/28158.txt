In Gambia, many people took to social media to deplore the incident and criticize their government for not speaking out sooner.

One of the country’s most prominent human rights activists, Madi Jobarteh, started a petition protesting Mr. Sisay’s death, which he said would be delivered to the United States embassy in Banjul on Monday. If the nation’s coronavirus restrictions are lifted by then, he said there would also be a protest outside the embassy.

Mr. Sisay’s father, Lare Sisay, who worked for the United Nations before he retired, described his son as “very pious” and someone who “goes to the mosque and prays.”

“He wasn’t into any sort of trouble that I am aware of,” Mr. Sisay told the Fatu Network, the most prominent news site in Gambia, adding, “He does not like violence of any kind.” On his Facebook page, Mr. Sisay said he formerly worked for the United Nations Development Program.

Taking to social media, the elder Mr. Sisay connected his son’s death to the problem of police violence against black men.
