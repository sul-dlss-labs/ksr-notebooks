A metro Atlanta man was killed Saturday in an officer-involved shooting in Mississippi.

Leonard Parker, 53, of Covington, was fatally shot by an officer responding to a disturbance about 3 a.m., according to police in Gulfport, Mississippi.

The officer was sent to a home in the 200 block of 25th Street after receiving multiple 911 calls, the department said in a statement.

He was walking toward the home when a vehicle that was leaving the scene drove toward him, according to police. The officer pulled out his gun and fired. Parker, who was behind the wheel, was hit, police said.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is looking into the deadly shooting. The officer was placed on “non-enforcement duties,” Gulfport police said.
