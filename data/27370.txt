Two men were killed in a wreck Friday morning while fleeing U.S. Marshals in southeast Atlanta — but neither of them were wanted by the agency, authorities said.

The single-vehicle crash occurred shortly after 11 a.m. on Forrest Park Road, the Georgia State Patrol said.

U.S. Marshals tried to execute a felony arrest warrant for homicide, robbery and aggravated assault charges at a home in the 3000 block of Forrest Park Road. When they arrived, two men at the home noticed the unmarked police vehicles and fled north in a Nissan Rogue, according to the GSP.

The U.S. Marshals activated their police lights but didn’t chase the SUV and eventually lost sight of the vehicle, authorities said.

The driver of the Nissan, identified as David Cannimore, continued to flee at a high rate of speed and lost control around a curve, striking a utility pole and a tree, police said.

Cannimore and his passenger, Bryce Metts, were trapped inside the car and pronounced dead when first responders arrived.

The GSP later determined Cannimore had an arrest warrant for failure to appear in court, but neither man was actually wanted by U.S. Marshals.
