KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Police said it was a 38-year-old man from Overland Park, Kan., that they killed in a shoot-out near I-435 and Front Street Tuesday morning.

Independence Police say they first noticed Todd S. Weber driving suspiciously in a truck, with his headlamps off. They turned on their lights and started to follow him and used stop sticks when he wouldn’t pull over for them.

They say Weber continued to drive at very slow speeds and was followed slowly by many police cars so that spectators described it as a sort of “parade.” Kansas City Police also joined the pursuit.

Then, police say, when Weber stopped near I-435 south of Front Street, he got out and started shooting at them. They returned fire, striking and killing him. No officers were injured in the incident.

The incident shut down both directions of I-435 at Front Street to 24 Highway for several hours during the morning rush. The northbound lanes finally reopened around 7:45 a.m. after being closed for several hours. The southbound lanes reopened about 8:30 a.m.
