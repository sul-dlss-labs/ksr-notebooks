A South Side man was fatally shot by Chicago police early Saturday after he tried to run over an officer who attempted to stop his vehicle on the South Side, officials said.

Tory Davis, 29, of the 400 block of West 81st Street, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

The shooting happened at 1:52 a.m. after officers working as part of the federally funded Operation Safe City initiative were alerted to a crash in the 800 block of East 79th Street that had injured another person, police said.

The officers, part of the initiative targeting high-crime areas on the weekends, tried to pull over the vehicle that witnesses told them was involved in the crash.

The car, being driven by Davis, was stopped at a nearby gas station. Police ordered the driver to get out of the vehicle, but the vehicle began moving in their direction "in an attempt to strike one of the officers," police said.

Police said the officer discharged his gun after being in "fear of his life."

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating.
