We now know the name of the man who died in an officer-involved shooting Saturday night.

36-year-old Keith Boggs died from a self-inflicted shotgun wound to the head. It happened just before 7 p.m Saturday, near 29 ½ and Bunting Avenue.

Original reports said there was a suicidal man with a gun in that area. Boggs did sustain four nonfatal gunshot wounds from law enforcement, according to the Mesa County Coroner.

“She came and woke me up, and we went back to the back bedroom, because we didn’t know what was going on. And at that point, the baby was still sleeping so we went out behind the fence and was looking out and saw a cop walk out with his assault rifle,” said Adam Ivie, Grand Junction Resident. “And at that point, cops had flooded that area.”

No one else was injured.
