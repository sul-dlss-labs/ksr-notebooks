PHOENIX — An Arizona Department of Public Safety officer and Maricopa County Adult Probation officer were involved in a shooting in Phoenix on Wednesday afternoon, authorities said.

Phoenix police responded to the shooting near 24th Street and Thomas Road, which involved officers from other jurisdictions, according to the Phoenix Police Department.

An Arizona DPS officer and County Adult Probation officer were on a team searching for a fugitive, Phoenix police said. When the man was found, he was with a woman and fled from the officers.

Phoenix police investigators said the man was armed and shot himself with a handgun. The woman picked up the handgun and pointed it toward the DPS and Adult Probation officers, leading them to respond by shooting her.

The man and woman were pronounced dead on scene, authorities said. Police identified the deceased Thursday as Jacob Hernandez, 28, and Kenzie Keyes, 30.

The Phoenix Police Department was not involved in the shooting but will handle the investigation.

No other information was immediately available.

It was the fourth shooting of the year involving DPS and 39th overall by Valley law enforcement, according to KTAR News 92.3 FM research.
