NEW HYDE PARK, N.Y. — A man who forced a woman into her car and then sexually assaulted her outside a Long Island supermarket was shot and killed by police officers, a Nassau County Police spokesman said Friday.

Frank Hernandez, 26, of New Hyde Park, was seen by witnesses at about 10:50 p.m. Thursday forcing the woman into her vehicle as she left a Stop & Shop supermarket, said Detective Sgt. Anthony Repalone.

The witnesses reported that the man was wearing a ski mask and appeared to have a gun. They said they saw he and his victim drive toward the rear of the supermarket parking lot. A short time later, the vehicle was spotted leaving the parking lot, where officers confronted the man.

Police say he refused to comply with orders to leave the vehicle and then tussled with one of the officers. A second officer saw the suspect attempting to grab his colleague’s handgun and fired.

Hernandez was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police say they recovered a “simulated” handgun at the scene.

Investigators later determined that Hernandez had sexually assaulted the 22-year-old woman behind the shopping center.

The investigation was continuing. The sex assault victim and the two officers were treated at hospitals and released.
