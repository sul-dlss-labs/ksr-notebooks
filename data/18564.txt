A Fair Oaks woman was identified Monday as the driver who led officers on a high-speed chase through Sacramento County and eventually crashed her car into the side of a salon in Old Folsom, officials said. Alicia French, 20, was killed early Friday morning near Sutter Street, the Sacramento County Coroner's records show. The chase started just after 3 a.m. near Howe and Marconi avenues after Sacramento County sheriff's deputies pulled up behind a Honda Accord and ran the license plate as part of a routine check, and the plate came back stolen. Officers tried to pull over the vehicle, but French took off at high speeds onto Roseville Road and eventually Madison Avenue, reaching speeds of more than 100 mph, according to the sheriff's department. Somewhere along Madison Avenue, officers put down spike stripes and at least one tire was flattened. As French began to take a turn after the Rainbow Bridge on Riley Street in Folsom, she lost control and slammed into a salon just before Sutter Street in Old Folsom, officers said. French was pronounced dead at the scene. "I would describe it as dangerous because of the speeds that were reached," Turnbull said. "Luckily, at three oâ€™clock in the morning, there is very little traffic on the road. That is one of the things we look at -- not only that, (but) the roads (were) dry. The only risk factor at the time of the pursuit was the speed." Although the license plate came back stolen, deputies cannot confirm if the vehicle itself is stolen because the car is so smashed up, officers can't get to the VIN in the vehicle. Both directions of Riley Street were closed for several hours between Scott and Sutter streets. No additional details have been released.
