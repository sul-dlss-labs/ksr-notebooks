Ontario police fatally shot a man they say lunged at them with a knife Monday night outside a mini market in that city.

The incident happened about 11:30 p.m. in the 1500-block of East Fourth Street, just east of Interstate 10.

The confrontation occurred after officer was flagged down and told of a man armed with a knife, Cpl. Bill Russell said in a written statement.

“He and other … officers located the suspect in the parking lot of the AM/PM mini market at that location,” according to the statement. “The suspect was uncooperative and lunged toward the officers, despite their commands to put the knife down.

“In fear for their lives, four officers fired their weapons at the suspect.”

The man died at the scene. He is a 42-year-old city resident, San Bernardino County coroner’s officials say. His name is being withheld pending notification of relatives.

The four officers who opened fire range in police experience from 23 years to less than a year, Russell wrote. Their names have not been released.

The Ontario Police Department is investigating the shooting. Anyone with information about the case may call Detective Dave Rowe at 909-395-2749.
