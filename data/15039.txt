Phoenix police officers shot and killed a man Monday night after he opened fire on them, according to police.

Investigators on Tuesday said the shooter was a 55-year-old man but they did not identify him by name.

No officers were injured.

Police responded to the scene near 15th Avenue and Bethany Home Road about 10:30 p.m. when someone in the area called saying they heard "gunshots or fireworks," said Officer James Holmes, a Phoenix police spokesman.

Two officers approached a home in the 1500 block of Berridge Lane where they suspected the noises might be coming from, but were shot at by a man standing on the porch of a home just north of them, Holmes said.

Police located the man, who was holding a rifle and who continued to fire at officers, and called for additional units, Holmes said.

A police helicopter previously over South Mountain heard the call and responded. Other officers climbed on the roofs of nearby homes in an effort to get the officers who remained trapped behind a car by the gunman out, Holmes said.

The man then fired at a police helicopter and other officers opened fire, Holmes said. The man slumped on his porch and paramedics tried to treat him, Holmes said.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Joseph Martin, 58, lives on Rovey Avenue just around the corner from where the shooting took place. Martin said he was watching TV and his wife was reading when they heard several shots. After police came, Martin continued to hear shots.

"You could tell it was multiple types of weapons," Martin said.

Police are investigating whether the man has history with police or any mental-health diagnosis, Holmes said.
