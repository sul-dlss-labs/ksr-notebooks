State police say a 40-year-old man armed with a handgun has been killed by a trooper in the Hudson Valley after a five-hour standoff.

Troopers say the confrontation began after they got to a 911 call about a domestic issue Monday evening in East Fishkill.



Negotiators spent five hours trying to convince John Terzani to peacefully surrender and failed to subdue Terzani with a stun gun.

Police say Terzani pointed his handgun at officers at about 2:20 a.m., prompting an unidentified seven-year veteran to fire multiple rounds at Terzani.

He was taken to St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, where he was pronounced dead early Tuesday.

An investigation into the shooting is continuing.
