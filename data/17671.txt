Phoenix police late Thursday identified the gunman who fatally shot Officer David Glasser as 20-year-old Israel Santos-Banos.

Glasser was shot while responding to a burglary call in the village of Laveen on Wednesday afternoon.

Police say he was among up to six officers who went to a home in the 7700 block of S. 48th Lane knowing that they would be confronting an armed suspect. The 911 caller made the disclosure while meeting with police in a nearby parking lot beforehand.

Santos-Banos opened fire at police while sitting inside a vehicle in the driveway, police said. He was killed by return fire.

Glasser was pulled to safety and taken to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries Thursday, police said.

Update: An earlier version of this story gave an incorrect age for Santos-Banos.
