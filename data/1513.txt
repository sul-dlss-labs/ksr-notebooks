BANGOR – A federal judge has dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit against Maine police and mental health officials arising from the shooting of a man at his Somerville home by a Lincoln County sheriff’s deputy in 2002.

U.S. District Judge John Woodcock ruled in a case filed by relatives of the shooting victim, Michael Buchanan. His brother Daniel Buchanan of Massachusetts and other siblings of the victim sought more than $1 million in damages from state and Lincoln County officials.

The suit claimed the state failed to provide crisis intervention services needed by Michael Buchanan, who was 61 and suffered from mental illness, but was off his medication at the time of the shooting.

Buchanan was shot by Deputy Kenneth Hatch after police were called to his remote home on Feb. 25, 2002, to investigate a complaint that Buchanan had started a fire in a neighbor’s woodpile. When police entered Buchanan’s home, Hatch’s partner, Deputy Robert Emerson, was stabbed.

Maine Attorney General Steven Rowe ruled in 2004 that Hatch was legally justified in shooting Buchanan because he believed that unlawful deadly force was being used against Emerson.

In a footnote to his ruling, Woodcock gave credit to a caseworker who was also a defendant for helping to improve Buchanan’s life. But he said the caseworker, Joel Gilbert, did not have the legal authority to force Buchanan to take his medications.

“Mr. Buchanan also died despite the considerable effort of his siblings, a kind neighbor and others,” the judge wrote. “The core of this tragedy is Mr. Buchanan’s mental illness and his decision in November 2000 to stop taking his medications – a decision that may itself reflect his illness.”

Robert Stolt, attorney for Daniel Buchanan, said no decision on an appeal had been made.
