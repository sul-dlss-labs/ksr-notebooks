GOSHEN, N.Y. >> An Orange County grand jury has declined to indict two Middletown police officers who shot Richard Dinneny to death on July 13 at 109 Overlook Drive in the city.

The case was investigated and taken to the grand jury by District Attorney David Hoovler.

According to authorities, Dinneny was at his estranged girlfriend’s home in violation of an order of protection. He called 911 from inside the home and said he was upset, intoxicated and armed with a gun. He said he wanted to die and would shoot any police officers who came to the home, authorities said.

Four Middletown officers went to the house, approached the front door and confronted Dinneny, who produced what appeared to be a black handgun in his right hand, authorities said. Despite repeated requests by officers to drop the weapon, he refused and raised it in the direction of the officers. Two officers fired five shots, striking Dinneny three times.

He died after being taken to Orange Regional Medical Center in Wallkill, N.Y.

It was later determined Dinneny’s weapon was a pellet gun, authorities said.

At the time of the shooting, the District Attorney’s Office said Dinneny had been convicted of manslaughter and felony assault in 1985 and served 21 years in state prison. They did not provide details.
