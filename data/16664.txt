The Alexandria Police Department is currently investigating a shooting incident that occurred shortly before 3 p.m. yesterday afternoon. Members of the U.S. Marshals Violent Offender Task Force were attempting to serve felony warrants on a Bobby R. Anderson, age 27 of Alexandria. Anderson was wanted on felony warrants held by A.P.D. and the Rapides Parish Sheriff’s Department which included two (2) counts of Attempted Second Degree Murder, Burglary, Two (2) Counts of Forgery, Unauthorized Use of Motor Vehicle, and Misrepresentation During Booking.

Preliminary reports indicate that Task Force Members encountered Anderson at a convenience store in the 4400 block of Lee Street. Anderson was reportedly armed and threatened officers as they were attempting to take him into custody, resulting in a Task Force Member discharging his duty weapon striking Anderson. Crime scene personnel did collect a firearm believed to be possessed by Anderson at the time of the shooting. Anderson was pronounced deceased at the scene by medical and coroner personnel, with a forensic autopsy to follow.

As the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of Alexandria, and the involved Task Force Member was not an A.P.D. officer – A.P.D. will lead the investigation with cooperation and assistance from all agencies involved. A.P.D. Investigators and Crime Scene Personnel have been on scene since shortly after the reporting and remain on scene as of this release. A.P.D. stresses that this investigation is in the preliminary stages, with much work left to do. As with any such investigation, the process will take time and effort as detectives will thoroughly interview all witnesses (both civilian and law enforcement), collect and review physical evidence, and will present all findings to the District Attorney for review.

The names of the Task Force Members will not be disclosed at this time pursuant to Department of Justice Policy.
