SARASOTA COUNTY — After receiving calls for a report of a battery in the 4000 block of Dyer Lane, deputies located a woman with a knife at the intersection of Dyer Lane and Corey Road.

The suspect, identified as 63-year-old Adrean Stephenson, confronted deputies with the blade and began to move toward them. She was shot after ignoring deputies commands to drop the knife and a Taser was ineffective, according to a Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office press release on Sunday night.

According the Sheriff’s Office, deputies responded around 5 p.m. for a battery and located the suspect on foot.

A deputy ordered Stephenson to drop the knife, but she advanced and deputies deployed a Taser that was ineffective. Stephenson continued to advance and a second deputy shot the woman who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Next of kin has been notified. No one else was injured during the incident.
