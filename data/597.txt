A 37-year-old man who allegedly fired an assault rifle at sheriff’s deputies early Saturday died from a shotgun blast when deputies returned fire, the Los Angeles County coroner’s office said Monday.

Mark Gault was found dead in his childhood home in the 29300 block of Snapdragon Place at 5:07 a.m. Saturday, more than three hours after he fired on two deputies and a sergeant as they arrived in response to a vandalism call in the neighborhood.

Gault, who was reportedly standing in front of his parents’ home holding an assault rifle, pointed the weapon at deputies and shot it several times. The deputies fired back, hitting Gault in the upper torso. Gault then ran back inside the home.

Believing Gault had barricaded himself inside, deputies summoned a special weapons team to enter the house, where they found him dead.

The cause of death was a single shotgun pellet wound to the chest, said Lt. Mike Riddle of the coroner’s office.

The deputies involved in the shooting will be assigned to desk duty pending further investigation by homicide detectives and the department’s Internal Affairs Division, officials said.
