An elderly Upland man was killed Tuesday when a man driving a car reported stolen slammed into his vehicle after a short police pursuit.

Brett Joseph Fagan, 25, of Corona was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of murder, vehicular manslaughter, felony evading causing a death and a parole violation, according to a police news release. He was booked at West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga with no bail.

The mayhem started Sunday when an Upland resident reported a burglary in which two cars were stolen from his garage.

Shortly before 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, a Claremont police officer spotted one of the cars – a silver BMW sedan – near Padua Avenue and Base Line Road.

Without knowledge of the earlier burglary, the Claremont officer tried to stop the BMW because it did not have a license plate.

The driver sped off, and the officer pursued. Seconds later, the BMW crashed into two vehicles at 16th Street and Benson Avenue in Upland.

“He just drove in a straight line. It was a very short pursuit,” Upland police Sgt. Greg Signorio said.

After the crash, the driver ran. Police found him hiding in the backyard of a nearby residence.

The drivers of the two other vehicles – both Upland residents – were seriously injured and were taken to a hospital, police said.

William Blanchard, 76, who was driving a Dodge Dakota truck, was pronounced dead at 11:18 a.m., according to San Bernardino County coroner’s officials.

“It’s a tragedy when anything like this happens,” Signorio said.

Fagan suffered minor injuries in the crash and did not need medical attention.

A background check on Fagan revealed that he was wanted for a parole violation after being convicted of stealing another vehicle, Signorio said.
