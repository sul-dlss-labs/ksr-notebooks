A 19-year-old man was killed in a crash during a police pursuit in Selma.

Alabama State Troopers on Tuesday identified the man as Jamar Desean Pritchett.

Sr. Trooper Reginal King said the crash happened at 12:56 a.m. Sunday on Dallas County 37 in the Valley Grande city limits. He was driving a 1999 Ford Crown Victor that left the roadway and struck several trees. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Selma Police Chief Spencer Collier said police responded at 11:50 p.m. Saturday to Michael’s Pub on U.S. 80 to a report of a man armed with a small rifle. Within minutes, an officer assigned to the department’s Special Operations Unit spotted the man in a blue Ford Crown Victoria leaving the area of the pub.

The officer attempted to stop the vehicle on Alabama 219, but the chief said the man – now identified as Pritchett – refused to stop. Additional Selma officers and Dallas County deputies joined the pursuit.

Collier said the driver continued at a high rate of speed through Selma and into Valley Grande. As the pursuit turned onto County Road 37, officers reduced their speed as Pritchett began to drive “extremely reckless.” He said the vehicle left the road and went airborne before striking the trees.

The chief requested Alabama State Troopers investigate the accident. In addition to weapons charges, Collier said, Pritchett had an outstanding felony warrant for burglary.
