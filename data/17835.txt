The Pinellas Park Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that occurred at 6082 96th Terrace North on Saturday night.

The incident started as a domestic dispute between Irena K. Bogusiewicz, 58, and her husband Waldemar Bogusiewicz, 59. Waldemar, who was reportedly intoxicated, was arguing with his wife over who was going to buy more beer.

During this argument their 25-year-old son Adrian K. Bogusiewicz came out only to see what was going on between his parents.

Irena left the residence because of her husband's demeanor and then called the police, leaving her son and husband alone in the home.

Sometime between when Irena left the residence and when the police arrived on scene Waldemar and Adrian got into a confrontation that resulted in Waldemar shooting Adrian multiple times within his bedroom.
