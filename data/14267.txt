ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A Baltimore man who led police on a chase in Annapolis that ended with his car crashing into a tree and killing a friend has been sentenced to 4 years in prison.

Twenty-eight-year-old John Kinlein was sentenced Wednesday in Anne Arundel County Circuit Court. The Capital of Annapolis reports (http://bit.ly/1dOoFTt) that he had pleaded guilty to negligent manslaughter with an automobile in the death of 29-year-old James Patrick Darcy Jr. of Annapolis.

Prosecutors say on March 29, 2014, Kinlein stopped to help with a disabled vehicle but got into a confrontation with the car's occupant.

Prosecutors say Kinlein hit the car's occupant, then drove off. Police chased Kinlein for about a mile before he crashed into a tree, killing Darcy, his passenger.
