Sheriff’s officials have identified the deputies who fatally shot a man after a Corona-to-Perris car chase Nov. 11.

Deputy Michael Heurer and Deputy Robert Powe were placed on paid administrative leave after the incident, which is department policy in all shootings involving officers, Riverside County sheriff’s officials said. They have since returned to work, said Deputy Armando Munoz, a sheriff’s spokesman.

Heurer and Powe both have been employed by the department since 2001, he said.

Aaron Forgash, 38, whose last known address was in Long Beach, died at the scene of the shooting in a residential neighborhood, sheriff’s officials said.

Sheriff’s officials have not disclosed why deputies opened fire.

Sgt. Kim Velasco, a spokeswoman for the Corona Police Department, said the pursuit began after police received a 1:43 p.m. call reporting a man trying to pass a fraudulent $1,350 check and using fraudulent identification at the Home Depot at 1355 E. Ontario Ave.

Officers spotted the minivan suspected of being involved in the incident as it left the parking lot, Velasco said. A short time later, officers again spotted the vehicle and an officer tried to stop it, she said. The driver failed to yield and police gave chase, Velasco said.

Sheriff’s officials said in a news release that they received a request from Corona police to help with the chase at 2:20 p.m. as the minivan headed east on Cajalco Road approaching Perris. The man had been driving erratically, including speeding off-road through a golf course, sheriff’s officials said.

The chase ended on the 1500 block of Palma Bonita Lane in a residential neighborhood in Perris, where Forgash was shot.

A witness told The Press-Enterprise that Forgash’s hands were empty when he got out of the minivan. She said a motorcycle officer fired when the man, with his hands down, made what she described as a twisting motion with his upper body.
