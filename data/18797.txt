A man died Tuesday in LaGrange after sheriff’s deputies shocked him with a Taser, and the GBI was asked to investigate the deadly confrontation, authorities said.

Just before 4:30 p.m., deputies responded to a call about a domestic dispute at a home in the 700 block of Hines Road, Troup County sheriff's Sgt. Stewart Smith said Wednesday.

Witnesses told them James Thompson was threatening his daughter with a knife and a gun, Smith said.

Deputies tried to make contact with the people inside the home. They called and got no answer. Then they heard two shots.

“And very quickly after that,” Smith said, “the male and female exited the home with the male restraining the female and holding a handgun.”

The woman, identified as 24-year-old Kyley Thompson, appeared to be bleeding from the chest area, Smith said.

“The male was then ordered to put down the gun, which he did,” Smith said. “And he released the female.”

At that point, deputies tried to take Thompson, 44, into custody and treat the injured woman.

“While doing this,” Smith said, “the male became very combative, fighting with deputies, resisting arrest. During the altercation, a Taser was deployed to gain compliance from Thompson.”

Thompson was handcuffed and escorted down the driveway, Smith said.

“Deputies placed Thompson on the ground next to the patrol vehicle to continue securing him, and at that point the male became unresponsive,” Smith said.

Deputies were unsuccessful in attempts to revive Thompson using CPR and an automated external defibrillator.

His daughter was flown to an Atlanta area hospital, where she was in stable condition.

“At this point, GBI has no updates on the use of force investigation being conducted,” GBI spokeswoman Nelly Miles said.
