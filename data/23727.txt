The Topeka Police Dept. has released the name of the woman who escaped through the window during a 16-hour standoff that left two dead earlier this month.

A TPD spokesperson said the 24-year-old woman, identified as Janel Delao, is being treated as a witness in the shootings.

Delao crawled out of a second story window not long before police entered the home, in the Eastgate Townhomes, ending a standoff during which shots were fired at officers intermittently throughout the night.

After entering the home, officers found the bodies of Juan Lucio, 33, of Topeka and Tiffany Montalvo, 31, of Eudora. Investigators say they are treating their deaths as a murder-suicide.

The standoff ,in the 3500 block of SE 7th Street, began around 9:45 p.m. Thursday January 4 and lasted into the following afternoon. Gunfire, aimed at officers, rang out sporadically throughout the night. Police have not said who was firing.
