Travion Richard, a 17-year-old black youth, died on Saturday, Sept. 19, after he was shot by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies at 3147 Banning St. in Lynwood, authorities said.

Two deputies from a Sheriff's Department gang enforcement team were driving along Banning St. when they saw Richard, whom they said they saw run from them earlier in the evening.

According to a statement released by the Sheriff's Department, the two deputies "attempted to contact the suspect" when he took a gun out of his waistband and pointed it at the deputies.

According to Los Angeles County coroner's records, the deputies shot Richard, of Long Beach, several times in the arms, chest and back. He was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:05 p.m., said Ed Winter, a spokesman for the coroner's office.

According to the statement, deputies recovered a handgun from the scene.
