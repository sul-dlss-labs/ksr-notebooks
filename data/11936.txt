The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating the death of a man who died Friday while police in Rochester were attempting to arrest him on a warrant.

The Hennepin County medical examiner's office identified the deceased as Mark Adam Prom, 39, of Rochester.

Rochester police said Sunday night that the warrant on Prom was for a felony and that he had a history of run ins with police.

The BCA, in a written statement, said the preliminary investigation shows that Rochester police attempted to arrest Prom about 6 p.m. Friday.

Rochester investigators Lesley Kenyon and David Drees went to Prom's home. He ran away and when Kenyon caught him Prom began fighting.

Drees arrived almost immediately and saw the assault, the BCA said. The two investigators subdued Prom, although the statement does not state how this was done.

As police were trying to handcuff Prom he became unresponsive, the BCA said.

The two investigators and first responders attempted to resuscitate Prom, but without success, the BCA said.

Prom was taken by ambulance to St. Mary's Hospital in Rochester where he was pronounced dead. Kenyon and Drees were both treated at St. Mary's Hospital for minor injuries and released.

Drees is a 17-year veteran with the Rochester Police Department; Kenyon has been with the department for four years. Both are now on standard administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation, the BCA said.
