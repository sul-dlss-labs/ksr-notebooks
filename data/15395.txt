LONG BEACH >> Authorities on Saturday released the name of an 18-year-old man killed in an officer-involved shooting Friday in Long Beach.

He was identified as Carey Smith-Viramontes, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

Officers were sent to the 2300 block of Eucalyptus Avenue about 8:10 a.m. Friday to assist in locating a girl who had been reported as a runaway, according to the Long Beach Police Department.

“During the investigation, an officer-involved shooting occurred which resulted in the death of a male adult,” according to a police statement.

The preliminary investigation revealed that a responding officer made contact with the person who called police and determined that the girl was inside a residence with a man with whom she had a prior relationship, police said.

“The officer also learned there was a valid restraining order on file prohibiting the male from having contact with the juvenile and there was a history of multiple domestic violence cases on file involving the two subjects,” according to the LBPD.

“An argument ensued between the involved parties and the male adult armed himself with a knife. Fearing for the safety of the parties, the officer discharged his weapon, striking the suspect.”

Firefighters pronounced the man dead at the scene, police said, adding that a knife was recovered.

As is standard in such cases, the shooting was under investigation by the Long Beach police Homicide Detail as well as the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
