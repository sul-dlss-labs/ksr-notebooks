TRENTON — The state Attorney General's Office said today investigators are looking into a State Police trooper's fatal shooting of a Newark man Thursday evening.

Troopers approached Dawud Alexander, 24, at about 6 p.m. in Irvington after learning he was in possession of two weapons, the office said, adding that when the troopers identified themselves, Alexander allegedly ran away and a foot chase ensued.

During the chase, Alexander was seen dropping a weapon that was later recovered, the office said. Witnesses said Alexander was holding his hand at his waist as he fled and detectives reported that he pointed a handgun back at them.

Authorities said one detective shot Alexander an unspecified number of times in the upper body, and a loaded revolver was recovered at the scene. Alexander was taken to University Hospital in Newark, where he was pronounced dead at about 7:40 p.m.

The Attorney General's Shooting Response Team — made up of deputy attorneys general, detectives from the state Division of Criminal Justice and the State Police — is investigating, as is standard for any trooper-involved shootings.

The state declined to release additional information.
