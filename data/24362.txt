The highway patrol says a man shot and killed himself after a chase in Cabool on Monday.

An off-duty Cabool police officer saw Micha Ross, 40, on Panther Road south of town. Ross was wanted on a felony warrant.

Ross sped off when a highway patrol trooper arrived on the scene. The chase went on several county roads in southern Texas County. The trooper eventually stopped the chase.

A short time later, a Cabool police officer found the car and started another pursuit. Ross eventually stopped his car in the business district and held a gun to his head. He walked into two businesses, then onto highway 63 and then went in front of another business where he shot himself.

An autopsy will be done in Springfield on Thursday.

The highway patrol's division of drug and crime control is handling the investigation.
