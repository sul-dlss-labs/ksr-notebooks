Tampa Police say a suspect was killed early Thursday after he fired a gunshot at officers responding to a domestic disturbance call.

Police say officers responded to a domestic disturbance call on the 3300 block of Cherokee Avenue at around 1:10 a.m. Thursday.



Once on scene, officers spoke to Sunny Chin, 53, who they say who refused to cooperate and pointed a handgun at them.

"The gentleman who lives there came out, he was armed," said Tampa Police spokesperson Steve Hegarty. "[Officers] engaged him in conversation, he pulled the trigger with his weapon, it did not go off. He went back into the house."

Additional officers were dispatched to the house, and officers then tried to communicate with Chin via a PA system. Chin reportedly then challenged officers to come get him.

Later, Chin came out of the house and onto his carport, with a gun tucked into a towel around his waist. Officers approached the suspect while carrying a shield, and ordered him to keep his hands visible and not fire on them.

Chin then reportedly reached for the weapon at his waist and fired one shot, which hit the shield.

"Our officers had a shield up, he hit the shield dead on," said Hegarty.

Officers then returned fire, killing Chin.

Officials say no officers were injured. The woman in the house, Chin's girlfriend, Pasko Bunluan, suffered scrapes and bruises but no major injuries, and is cooperating with the investigation.

She said her relationship with her boyfriend of 18 years has always been rocky. It was no different this morning when she said he was drinking and acting violent.

The officers involved - Corporal Sean Stuart, Corporal Stephen Drabiniak and Officer John Simpkins - will be placed on administrative leave during the investigation, as is standard procedure in officer-involved shootings.
