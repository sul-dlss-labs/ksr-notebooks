SAN ANTONIO – A man who was shot and killed by two San Antonio police officers has been identified.

The shooting happened around 12:02 a.m., Sunday, in the 200 block of Pima Street.

According to San Antonio Police Chief William McManus, officers were canvassing the area, doing a routine drug patrol, when they approached a man in his vehicle.

The man, identified as 46-year-old Rodolfo Gonzales, noticed officers approaching and he tried to escape and avoid arrest, according to McManus.

During that encounter, police said Gonzales tried to pull a handgun from his waistband, and that’s when the officers fired in his direction.

Gonzales was struck by the gunfire and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to SAPD.

McManus said the two officers involved have been with SAPD for three years, and both will be placed on administrative duty pending further review of the case.
