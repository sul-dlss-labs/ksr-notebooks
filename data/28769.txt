NEWPORT NEWS, Va. - A motorcyclist died following a traffic pursuit by State Police on I-664 early Wednesday morning.

Around 1:32 a.m., a State Trooper was monitoring traffic on I-664 near the Monitor-Merrimac Bridge Tunnel in Suffolk, when a 2006 Honda CBR600 motorcycle sped past the trooper going 89 mph in the posted 60 mph zone.

The trooper initiated a traffic stop and 28-year-old Andrew S. Baker pulled off on the shoulder on the MMBT. As the trooper was exiting his vehicle and approaching the motorcyclist, officials say Baker sped away going northbound on the MMBT toward Newport News.

A pursuit was then initiated. As Baker exited I-664 at Terminal Avenue in Newport News, police say he lost control, ran off the ramp, struck the wall and was ejected from the bike.

Baker was taken to Riverside Regional Medical Center where he later died. Police say he was wearing a helmet.

The crash remains under investigation by Virginia State Police.
