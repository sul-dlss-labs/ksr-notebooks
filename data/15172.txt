Authorities have charged four people in connection to a fatal rollover accident that left one illegal immigrant dead and 11 more injured.

U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents filed human smuggling charges against four people in two separate cases.

Federal court records show the investigation started following a fatal accident off FM 2221 just north of La Joya on Thursday.

HSI agents said 18-year-old Juan Manuel Garcia was behind the wheel of a truck with more than a dozen illegal immigrants.

Sudden U-Turn

The records show that a Border Patrol agent had spotted Garciaâ€™s pickup and had just activated his overhead lights when Garcia made a sudden U-turn.

Court records show that the unsafe turn ended with a rollover accident that left one immigrant dead and 11 more injured.

Immigrants at the scene identified Garcia as the driver of the pickup truck.

Border Patrol agents spoke to Garcia at the scene and he allegedly admitted to being behind the wheel during the fatal accident.

Stash House

An investigation led HSI agents to two separate stash houses in Sullivan City.

Agents spoke to Eloy Mendoza, Jr and Jose Manuel Lovato-Balleza at home where authorities found a total of 15 illegal immigrants.

The two men allegedly admitted to being caretakers of the immigrant stash house.

Second Stash House

Court records in a second case show that the accident also led investigators to a home off Ebony Street in Sullivan City.

Authorities arrested Julia Resendiz after finding 16 illegal immigrants at her home.

Resendiz allegedly told HSI agents that she was getting paid $10 dollars per person to care for the immigrants.

Two immigrants are being held as witnesses against Resendiz.
