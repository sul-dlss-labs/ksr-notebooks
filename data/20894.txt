OTTAWA COUNTY, MI -- A 20-year-old Holland area man who police say was suspected of robbing a Macatawa Bank branch has died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound suffered as officers conducted a traffic stop on a vehicle he was in.

Edgar Martinez died Friday, April 26, Ottawa County Sheriff's Lt. Mark Bennett said.

Martinez was a passenger in a 1994 Grand Am that police stopped in the Leisure Estates mobile home park, 523 Butternut Dr., at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday, April 25. Martinez was in the backseat. Three other teens, two 15-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were also inside.

Police used a tip and other evidence to piece together information about Martinez and his likely involvement in the bank robbery at 489 Butternut Dr. A man entered the Macatawa Bank branch there on Tuesday, April 23, and pulled a handgun just after 3:30 p.m. He fled with an undisclosed amount of money.

The younger teens inside the vehicle all complied with an officer's commands to exit and put their hands on their head. The 20-year-old instead pulled out a handgun and immediately shot himself once in the head, Bennett said. There were no other shots fired.

Martinez was taken to Spectrum Health Butterworth Hospital, where he later died.

Interviews with witnesses led police to determine Martinez was the bank robbery suspect, authorities said.

An autopsy will take place in the next few days.
