Ernesto Castaneda, a 22-year-old Latino, was shot twice by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Sunday, March 15, 2009, in the 3500 block of Temple City Boulevard in Rosemead, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

Castaneda's father had called police because he thought his son was under the influence of drugs and had armed himself with a machete, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

When deputies arrived Castaneda was in the backyard of a home with a baseball bat and the knife. Castaneda approached the deputies with the weapons, and they shot him, officials said.
