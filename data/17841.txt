HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. -- A suspect wielding a semi-automatic handgun in a domestic violence incident was wounded after deputies shot him overnight Riverview on Sunday.

Two HCSO deputies, Austin O'Neill and Joshua Berrios, arrived at the residence located at 9525 Grovedale Circle to investigate a domestic dispute.

They interviewed the female victim, Krista Kariema Wong, 24, who said her boyfriend, identified as Jamil Alejandro Valladares, 26, was outside of the residence in the parking lot and possibly in possession of a handgun.

When deputies approached the suspect, Valladares became verbally combative and then allegedly pulled a.40 caliber handgun out of his shorts and raised it.

Deputies "immediately drew their HCSO issued handguns and began firing at Valladares" resulting in the suspect being hit multiple times. The deputies were not injured.

According to HCSO, Valladares fired at deputies. Two bullet casings matching the caliber of the suspect's handgun were recovered at the scene.

Valladares was transported to a local hospital for treatment. There was no update to his condition at this time.
