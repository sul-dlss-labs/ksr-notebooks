DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- An Ida Grove man has died of injuries he suffered from a motorcycle crash that happened during a police chase, authorities said.

Kody Eldon Krager, 20, was one of three motorcyclists pursued by state troopers for reckless driving on Highway 175 on Saturday. Officials said Krager's vehicle collided head-on with a squad car driven by Ida County Sheriff's Deputy Randal Petersen.

Petersen had slowed down because the sun was in his eyes, and his car's emergency lights and sirens were on, according to an Iowa State Patrol report. It didn't say whether Krager and the others wore helmets.

Krager was taken to Mercy Medical Center in Sioux City, where he died. Petersen was released from the hospital on Saturday.
