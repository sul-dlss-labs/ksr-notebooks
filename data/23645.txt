GOODING, Idaho - Authorities say a woman who was shot after she pointed a rifle at police east of Gooding Tuesday afternoon has died from her injuries at a Boise hospital.

Gooding County Sheriff Shaun Gough says deputies and officers with the Gooding Police Department responded at around 4:39 p.m. Tuesday to a domestic dispute in the area of 1900 South 2200 East and found a woman standing in the road holding a rifle.

Kerry Lee Nield, 53, was transported to North Canyon Medical Center, and later flown to Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center in Boise. She died of her injuries around 5 a.m. Wednesday.
