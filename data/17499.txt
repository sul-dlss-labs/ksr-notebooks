34 year old Grant Hamilton of Lafayette was killed in a car crash Friday night involving a Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office vehicle.

It happened just around 11:30 in North Lafayette.

Immediately following the crash, Louisiana State Police began a preliminary investigation that revealed Hamilton was standing in the eastbound lane of LA 98 when he was struck by a fully marked Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office Ford Crown Victoria, driven by 22 year old Deputy John Malveaux, who was traveling eastbound on LA 98 to a non-emergency call.

Police say Hamilton was transported to Lafayette General Medical Center and was pronounced dead shortly after arrival due to injuries sustained in the crash.

Deputy Malveaux, who was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash and was not injured, submitted to a breath alcohol test showing no detectable signs of alcohol.

Impairment on the part of Hamilton is unknown at this time with toxicology analysis to be conducted by the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab.

The crash remains under investigation with the assistance of the Lafayette Parish Sheriff’s Office.

While the investigation remains ongoing, LSP urges both pedestrians and motorists to remain vigilant when near or on area roadways.

Pedestrians should maintain a heightened level of awareness while walking near the roadway. Simple precautions such as wearing reflective materials, avoiding distractions, and walking a safe distance from travel lanes while facing oncoming traffic could help prevent many pedestrian related crashes.

When possible, pedestrians should utilize the shoulder of the roadway or sidewalk and avoid walking in the travel lanes of a road, especially during dusk or night time hours, as the majority of pedestrian fatalities occur at night under poor lighting conditions.
