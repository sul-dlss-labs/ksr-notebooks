TRENTON – A man who allegedly robbed a Gibraltar gas station died early Wednesday after his car crashed into a business on Fort Street.

Gibraltar Police Chief Raymond Canterbury said the 50-year-old Taylor resident brandished a knife at the attendant at a Sunoco station near the intersection of West Jefferson Avenue and Gibraltar Road after 1 a.m. and fled with an unspecified amount of cash.

He drove to Future Fuels at the intersection of Fort Street and Van Horn Road in Trenton, where he had a conversation with two men there that prompted one to call 911.

The Trenton K-9 unit was the closest to the station and when it pulled up, the man drove north on Fort at a high rate of speed. The officer lost sight of the car momentarily before arriving at the crash site.

The driver apparently lost control of his Ford Escort and smashed into Debacker Lawn Care, 2501 Fort St., at about 1:25 a.m.

Trenton Police Chief James Nardone said the man was dead at the scene.

Canterbury said Trenton police turned over evidence from the crash site, and his department is “almost 100 percent sure” the man who robbed the Sunoco station is the same man who died in the crash. The owner of the station is out of town and Gibraltar police expect to close the case once he returns and releases surveillance footage.

Neither department would give the man’s name. Aside from his age and hometown, Canterbury said only that the man had a lengthy criminal record.
