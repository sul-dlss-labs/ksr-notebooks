A Newark man died last night, several hours after he was shot by a police detective, the Newark police said. The man, Fernando Cruz, 32, was spotted by two plainclothes detectives from the department's vehicle theft unit driving a stolen Lexus at 1:15 p.m. They approached the car, but he sped away, dragging one of the detectives, James Arroyo, a short distance. The other detective, Anthony Brown, fired at Mr. Cruz and struck him in the torso. Mr. Cruz died at 7:45 p.m. at University Hospital, the police said. Mr. Cruz was on parole and had been convicted of seven felonies, the authorities said. The detectives, who were treated for minor injuries, will be placed on modified duty pending the outcome of an investigation, the police said. Sabrina Tavernise (NYT)
