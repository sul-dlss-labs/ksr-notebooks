A 26-year-old man was fatally shot early Sunday after exchanging gunfire with Davenport police officers, the Scott County Sheriff’s Office said Monday.

An autopsy is pending for Matthew Donald Tobin, the sheriff’s office said in a news release posted to the website late Monday afternoon.

The sheriff’s office identified Justin King and Brenda Waline as the officers who also were injured in the incident.

King has been employed by the Davenport Police Department since Dec. 17, 2012. Waline has been with the department since Dec. 20, 1999.

The sheriff’s office is investigating the shooting. Sheriff Tim Lane said Monday that he did not have an exact timeline for when the investigation would be completed.

Davenport police responded about 5:13 a.m. Sunday to a burglary in progress at a residence in the 400 block of East 12th Street.

Officers confronted a person inside the home and a physical confrontation ensued and an officer discharged their firearm.

According to the sheriff’s office, Tobin also was armed and exchanged gunfire. King was struck in the head, according to the sheriff’s office.

King and Waline were transported to Genesis Medical Center-East Rusholme Street, Davenport, for non-life-threatening injuries. King underwent immediate surgery as a result of his injuries.

Tobin was pronounced dead at the scene. No other information was available Monday.

Online records show that Tobin was on parole on a drug charge out of Cerro Gordo County.
