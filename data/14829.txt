Three teenagers were hurt this morning when the stolen car they were driving crashed and burned in Garland.

Police first spotted the silver Toyota Camry about 2:30 a.m. and tried to pull over the teens at Jupiter and Kingsley roads. The driver fled east on Kingsley before he lost control near Garland Avenue, driving over a fire hydrant and crashing into some trees.

Officers pulled the three boys from the burning car. Two were taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital, and the third was hospitalized at Baylor University Medical Center.
