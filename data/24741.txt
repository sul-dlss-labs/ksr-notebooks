Heath fled on Route 125 at crashed at the intersection with Route 125."The entirety of the encounter between law enforcement and Mr. Heath, from his exiting the SUV to the final gunshot, is about 15 seconds," Senior Assistant Attorney General Peter Hinckley said.The video shows Heath tumbling out of the damaged vehicle, lying on the ground, loading a pistol and ignoring commands to drop the weapon. Heath fired three times, Hinckley said."About a second after Mr. Heath fires his pistol a second time, he draws his left arm across his chest again, pointing his gun in the direction of Officer Lambert, Trooper Goodwin and at least one private citizen," Hinckley said. "Mr. Heath fires another shot, his third, and only at this time, multiple shots begin being fired at Mr. Heath."Heath's daughter, Skyeann Sullivan, watched as investigators released the evidence."He shot first," she said. "What can they do?"Sullivan said she understands why the shooting was justified."I just want everybody to realize that's what drugs do to you," she said. "He wasn't like that beforehand."The state police colonel and Rochester police chief said they're proud of the courage their officers showed.
