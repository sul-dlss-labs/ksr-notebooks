MENLO PARK — A burglary suspect shot and killed by Menlo Park officers Tuesday was identified by the San Mateo County coroner as 52-year-old Jerry Lee Matheny.

Matheny, of Nuevo in Riverside County, was fatally shot after police said he pulled out a gun on officers chasing him from a home he was burglarizing.

Authorities say the man was a suspect in several burglaries that occurred in San Mateo and Santa Clara counties. Police spokeswoman Nicole Acker said Tuesday was the first time Menlo Park police encountered him.

Police did not immediately say why they believe Matheny frequented the area more than seven hours north of where he lives.

Officers responded at 12:33 p.m. Tuesday to Willow Road between Middlefield Road and Creek Drive after an office worker on Willow Place called to report a suspicious person, police said. The employee told dispatchers the man fit the description of a burglary suspect on a notification distributed by the property management company, which asked workers to be on the lookout for a man entering businesses and stealing personal property.

Police said they arrived and found Matheny in the middle of a burglary attempt and chased him through the area on foot. Officers then shot him with a Taser in an attempt to end the pursuit, at which point they said he pulled out a gun.

Multiple officers opened fire on the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene about 12:50 p.m. It was not clear if the suspect fired his weapon, which was submitted into evidence along with a stolen wallet.

One Menlo Park officer was taken to the hospital with a knee injury he received during the foot chase before the shooting occurred. Acker declined to identify the officers involved in the shooting.

The San Mateo County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Any witnesses to the incident are asked to contact Detective Jeff Cooley at 650-330-6344 or jbcooley@menlopark.org.
