A western Wisconsin man died Saturday from injuries he received two weeks earlier when he crashed his car while fleeing police, officials say.

Officers attempted to stop Logan A. Zappa, 20, of Deer Park, early on the morning of Aug. 1 near New Richmond because the license plates on his 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix did not match the vehicle, according to a news release issued by the St. Croix County Sheriff’s Office.

Zappa led police on a five-minute chase, before officers discontinued the pursuit, the news release said.

A short time later, St. Croix County sheriff’s deputies responded to a crash at the intersection of county highways T and H in Stanton, where they found Zappa seriously injured.

Investigators say Zappa ran a stop sign and collided with a pickup truck driven by a 20-year-old man from Amery.

Zappa was taken by helicopter to Regions Hospital in St. Paul. Both men were wearing seat belts, and the pickup’s driver was treated for his injuries at the scene of the crash.
