KENOSHA - The Kenosha County Tactical Response Team was justified in using deadly force against a 21-year-old Randall man in late July, according to findings by the Racine County Sheriff's Department and The Kenosha District Attorney.

A press release from the Kenosha County sheriff's department said David Estes, who died after being shot July 29, had several chances to end the incident peacefully, but did not.

Reports said Estes' wife called law enforcement to tell them her husband was intoxicated and win in possession of a loaded gun and threatening to kill himself.

About 20 minutes after the call, a deputy spotted Estes' pickup truck and followed him in a low-speed chase through the town of Bristol, into Salem, Paddock Lake, back into Salem and into Trevor. Blow out strips had to be used in order to finally stop the truck near a railroad track at Highway C.

According to reports, Estes repeatedly threatened to kill himself. After his truck was stopped, a trained negotiator attempted to negotiate with Estes for over two hours. During that time, less than lethal weapons were used in an attempt to stop Estes. However, when he raised a rifle and pointed it at one of the tactical team members, he was shot.

"It is unfortunate that a young man lost his life on July 29, 2007," said Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth in a prepared statement. "It appears though from reports I have seen that David Estes had a history of suicidal thoughts or wanting police officers to kill him."

"Estes was given several chances to end the incident peacefully, but instead chose to raise a loaded Remington 30-06 rifle at officers on the scene," Beth said.

In addition to the findings by the Racine Sheriff's Department and the Kenosha District Attorney, reviews by the Kenosha Sheriff's Department found the tactical response team had not violated any policies.
