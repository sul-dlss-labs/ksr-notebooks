The Lufkin Police Department is reporting an overnight, officer-involved shooting that left one person dead. Here is the official release from the Lufkin Police:

A Lufkin Police officer was involved in a fatal shooting early this morning following a call of a man attacking another man with a rifle on North Chestnut Street. Our preliminary investigation shows that just after midnight officers arrived in the 900 block of North Chestnut Street to find a man standing in front of two mobile homes, bleeding from his head.

The victim and a woman who was with him said they were robbed of their car keys, wallet, and cellphone by an armed white male. The victim said the suspect hit him in the head with the butt of long gun. He said the suspect fled on foot down North Chestnut Street.

The victim directed officers to a mobile home on the backside of the property where witnesses or the suspect may be located. Officers approached the mobile home and found the front door to be open but draped with a sheet. An officer knocked on the open door and a man inside the mobile home said “Come in, come in.” The officer told the man “Come out and talk to me please.” Seconds later the suspect emerged with a rifle still in his hands.

Upon seeing the uniformed officer, the suspect raised the gun as if to shoot the officer. That is when the officer fired approximately twice, striking the suspect. The suspect was taken by ambulance to a helipad and flown to an out-of-town hospital where he later died.

Per Department policy, the incident is under investigation by the Texas Rangers. In our ongoing effort of transparency, we are releasing a portion of the officer’s body-worn camera video. This video contains graphic footage of the shooting. Viewer discretion is advised.
