A man shot by Opp police officers on July 16 died Monday at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola, Fla.

Alabama Law Enforcement Agency Trooper Kevin confirmed that Pierre Gabriel Koellner, 29, of Opp died after being in critical condition at the hospital.

The State Bureau of Investigation continues to investigate the shooting that occurred following a two-vehicle crash on Highway 84 West between Babbie and Sanford in Opp.

Opp Police Chief Mike McDonald told the Andalusia Star News that Koellner, who is thought to be one of the drivers in the crash, ran from the scene on foot before police arrived.

When police made contact with Koellner near Leon Wiggins Road, he initially refused to remove his hands from his pants pocket. He then pulled out a handgun and pointed it at the officers.

McDonald said Koellner refused to comply with officers' orders to put the gun down. Koellner then started firing shots at the officers who returned fire striking Koellner.

No officers were injured.

SBI's findings will be handed over to the District Attorney's Office.
