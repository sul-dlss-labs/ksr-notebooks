The family of a man who died after a struggle with Greenville police is suing the city.In August 2010, Greenville officers said the family of Andrew Torres called for a police escort to get Torres to go for mental treatment. The family told police Torres was off his medicine and had lost touch with reality.Officers said while they were trying to take Torres into custody, he became violent and they shocked him with a Taser.Torres later died.The Greenville County coroner‘s office said the physical altercation with police likely contributed to his death, but the coroner said Torres did have an enlarged heart.The officers involved were put on administrative duty but were eventually cleared by the solicitor’s office.The lawsuit alleges officers entered the family home without knocking or announcing their presence.It further alleges that when Torres saw the officers he attempted to close his bedroom door, and instead of trying to de-escalate, officers forced their way into the room.Two sisters witnessed the incident and say Torres did not strike the officers or attempt violence, and he was repeatedly shot with a Taser, held down and handcuffed.The suit alleges when officers got off of Torres, he had no pulse, and the officers did not attempt to resuscitate or attempt CPR. The family claims EMS had to ask for the handcuffs to be removed so they could start life-saving measures.The family’s attorney, William Ehlies, told News Four that he is confident the family will prevail. Ehlies said no specific damages were requested.City Attorney Ron McKinney said, "As much compassion as we have for the family, a review of the actions taken by the officers determined the officers actions were appropriate."He went on to say, "There are no winners in this situation."According to McKinney, this is the first wrongful death lawsuit filed against the city under Chief Terri Wilfong's command.Police said since the 2010 incident, 60 officers and 25 dispatchers have been trained to deal with the mentally ill in crisis situations.
