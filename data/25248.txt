Grand Traverse County Sheriff’s deputies released the name of the 20-year-old Maple City man who was killed when he was a passenger in a car that crashed after it fled from police at high speeds.

Anthony Dane Case was killed in a crash that happened Friday on East Silver Lake Road south of Rennie School Road in Blair Township. Two passengers, a 20-year-old Kingsley woman and a 16-year-old male from Traverse City, were taken to Munson Medical Center with non-life-threatening injuries.

The driver, a 20-year-old Maple City man, was taken to Munson with non-life-threatening injuries and then taken to jail. He is expected to be charged with fleeing from police causing death and drunk driving causing death.

The chase began when a deputy clocked a 2006 Infinity travelling at 123mph in a 55mph zone at 11:40pm on US-31 South near Sundowner Drive in Garfield Township. The fleeing driver at one point turned off his car’s running lights and the deputy lost track of the fleeing vehicle, but soon after the deputy found the scene of the crash.
