Jorge Trejo, a 34-year-old Latino, was shot by Los Angeles police Sunday, Nov. 9, in the 3200 block of Huron Street in Cypress Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Shortly before midnight on Nov. 8, LAPD officers saw Trejo driving a blue Mazda pickup truck near West Avenue 26 and North Figueroa Street, according to a news release from the Los Angeles Police Department. Officers tried to stop Trejo, a suspect in an Oct. 30 assault with a deadly weapon case, and a pursuit began.

During the pursuit, which authorities said was "slow-speed," Trejo stopped at at least three locations and pointed a sawed-off shotgun at police. The first shooting occurred at West Avenue 26 and Lacy Street. The second occurred at Griffin Avenue and East Avenue 31. The third shooting occurred at Daly Street and Darwin Avenue, police said.

A SWAT team was then called to provide armored vehicles to contain Trejo’s pickup truck. The pursuit continued to North Broadway and Griffin Avenue, where the SWAT team took over.

The pursuit continued to Huron Street, south of Cypress Avenue. Police said they "conducted a pursuit intervention technique" to stop the truck. Trejo then pointed the gun in the direction of a SWAT officer, and police opened fire.

A SWAT team removed Trejo from the truck, and he was pronounced dead at the scene. A sawed-off shotgun was recovered from the truck.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Force Investigation Division at (213) 486-5230. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
