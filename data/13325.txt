LOS ANGELES (KTLA) — A man was shot and killed after a massive search followed the exchange of gunfire between LAPD officers and a gunman on Wednesday afternoon, police said.

The gunman had shot at officers, who fired back, at about 3:25 p.m. in the area of Mariposa Avenue and Pico Boulevard in the Pico-Union neighborhood, according to Los Angeles Police Department officer Bruce Borihanh.

No officers were injured, and several blocks were being searched for the gunman after the shooting, Borihanh said.

One man who was being pursued by police was found unconscious and not breathing, and paramedics were responding, police said.

News reporters and witnesses on scene heard shots fired just before 5 p.m.

About an hour later, LAPD officials confirmed that a man had been shot dead at the scene.

“We heard nine or 10 shots,” said witness Erik Escobar. “We saw an arrest happen, with a car with about three guys.”

LAPD was on modified tactical alert, police said.

Video from the scene showed officers searching passing vehicles, and officers in apparent SWAT gear outside a business on a street that was cordoned off with yellow police tape.

A perimeter remained set up on several streets, including busy Normandie Avenue, after police had confirmed that the man was dead. It was unclear whether police were continuing to search for others involved in the shooting.
