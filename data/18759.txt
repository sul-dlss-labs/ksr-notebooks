(CBS) â€“ A gunman has apparently committed suicide Tuesday, after wounding a woman in a home in northwest suburban Bartlett.

At no time did the gunman communicate with police during the four-hour standoff, which began about 11:15 a.m.

Bartlett Police Cmdr. Michael McGuigan said a woman who lived in the home, on the 700 block of Gardenia, told a neighbor she had been shot, and the neighbor called 9-1-1.

Within minutes police arrived. At 3:40 p.m., after efforts to contact the gunman failed, they went in and found the man dead.

McGuigan said the wound to the woman is not life-threatening.

He said he didn't think there had been problems in the past at the home requiring police intervention.

Access to the neighbor was shut off the entire time, and for two hours the nearby Sycamore Trails Elementary School was on lockdown.

Earlier concerns about a potential natural gas release were unfounded, police said.
