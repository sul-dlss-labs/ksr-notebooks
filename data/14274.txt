A woman who, was shot by Newton County Sheriff's deputies and died in a nearby hospital Monday afternoon, has been identified as Shirley Joyce Brown.

The 74-year old resident’s identity was released by NCSO Tuesday.

The Newton County Sheriff's Office responded to a suicide threat on Russell Braden Road - off Salem Road - around 3:30 p.m., when a woman came out of the residence holding a rifle, according to NCSO Public Information Officer Cortney Morrison.

Morrison said deputies issued lawful commands for her to lower the rifle. The woman reportedly did not comply, but pointed the weapon as deputies "fired multiple weapons," according to Morrison.

No deputies were injured in the incident.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation came to the scene after the incident as per regulations of all deputy-involved shootings. The GBI is working with the Newton County Coroner’s office in conducting an autopsy to determine the manner of death.
