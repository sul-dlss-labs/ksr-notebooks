The city of East Ridge and three East Ridge officers have been sued in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old Richard L. Dunn Jr. on Aug. 8, 2009.

The Circuit Court lawsuit filed by attorney John Wolfe asks $2 million in damages.

It is brought by Christine Dunn, mother of the shooting victim.

The suit says he was killed "for no good cause and without legal justification."

It says East Ridge "is vicariouisly liable for the acts of its officers as it abjectly failed to train, supervise or discipline them. Its hiring and retention of them was negligent."

Officers sued were Johnny Massengale, Robert Wade and Cody Gillund.

East Ridge Police said Dunn was shot after he rammed two police cars and tried to run over police officers on Sunday night.

The incident happened near Parkridge East Hospital after officers had answered a call about a disturbance at a motel, then chased Dunn to a dead-end street (Yale Street). Officers said Dunn was driving a stolen Mercedes Benz.

Erik Hopkins, East Ridge Police spokesman, said after the incident, "The preliminary investigation appears to indicate that the officers acted in accordance with proper procedures and state law."
