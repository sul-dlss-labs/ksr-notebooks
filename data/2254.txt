The prosecutor said Mr. Manigault had experienced ''some kind of emotional disturbance'' while staying with his parents, Andrew and Carol Manigault of Teaneck, and a girlfriend at the Christian Science center, Tenacre Foundation. Carol Manigault is a professor at Felician College in Lodi.

Investigators said Mr. Manigault suffered an anxiety or panic attack about 1:30 a.m., minutes before he drove away from the center in his parents' car. He arrived at the Swords' home dressed only in a T-shirt, socks and running pants, and attacked Mr. Sword after the banker let him in, thinking the young man needed help, the authorities said.

Officials at the Christian Science center said Mr. Manigault and his family had not gone there for help with any emotional or physical problems, and were not believed to be Christian Scientists. Tenacre Foundation, which opened on Great Road in 1921, offers Christian Scientist nursing care, which is based on prayer and theology instead of traditional medical treatment.

''He had simply come with his family for quiet time or to pray,'' the president of Tenacre Foundation, Cynthia R. Love, said. Her husband, Andrew, a manager at the center, said, ''This individual, who was here just for a day, was not involved in Christian Science nursing.''

Mr. Love said the Manigaults had not visited the center before.

Minutes after driving away from the Tenacre compound in his parents' 1996 Honda, Mr. Manigault sideswiped a tree on Great Road, struck a pick-up truck owned by John Dilluvio and his wife, Linda Kiefer, and sheared off a crabapple tree in their front yard. He made his way up the hill to the Sword home, and was moaning as he rang a doorbell about 1:45 a.m., said Mr. Giaquinto, the prosecutor. He said Mr. Manigault had picked the home at random.
