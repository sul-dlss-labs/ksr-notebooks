GREELEY, Colo. (AP/CBS4) - Authorities have shot and killed a man in Greeley after a meeting at a hotel to exchange child pornography went bad.

The incident happened at the Fairfield Inn.

Greeley Police Chief Jerry Garner told the Greeley Tribune that federal officials on a child pornography case had arranged the meeting Friday afternoon and asked Garner's department for assistance because they knew the suspect would be armed.

A statement from police Saturday evening identified the suspect as Jason Paul Collins, 30, of Johnstown.

"Lots of cops; undercover and in uniform were just running through the door. So I didn't really know what was going on," hotel employee Justin Russel said.

Garner said officers shot Collins after he allegedly touched his gun, which turned out to be a pellet gun. Greeley police Sgt. Joe Tymkowych says it wasn't immediately known which agency shot Collins.

The Tribune reports Greeley police SWAT team members and agents with the US Immigration and Custom Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations were at the scene.
