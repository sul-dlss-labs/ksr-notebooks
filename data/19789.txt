HARRIS COUNTY, Texas – One person is dead after a chase ended in a violent crash in northeast Harris County.

A deputy tried to stop a man driving a white Ford Explorer around 12:30 a.m. Wednesday in the 15900 block of Avenue D in Channelview for failing to dim his lights and an expired registration, but he kept going, the Harris County Sheriff’s department said.

The driver, Anthony Garcia, led the deputy on a short chase on Beltway 8 before exiting at Old Beaumont Highway onto the feeder road, deputies said. He was driving about 90 to 100 mph and ran several red lights before he hit a curb and lost control, deputies said.

The SUV rolled several times and Garcia was thrown from the vehicle. He was not wearing a seatbelt, according to investigators.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The feeder road near East Sam Houston Parkway was closed as the crash was being investigated.

Deputies are trying to determine if Garcia was intoxicated.
