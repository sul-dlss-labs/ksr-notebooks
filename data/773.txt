PLAIN DEALER REPORTERS

WARRENSVILLE HEIGHTS, OHIO - An off-duty Cuyahoga County jail guard arriving home after work early yesterday shot and killed a Cleveland man who ambushed and stabbed him, authorities said.

The guard was in stable condition at Meridia South Pointe Hospital last night.

Warrensville Heights Police Chief Frank Bova said Edward M. Phillips, 30, of Cleveland, tried to attack the jail guard, shortly after 2:30 a.m. Bova would not identify the guard but a spokesman for the Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Department said it was James L. Jones, 28, of Warrensville Heights.

Bova said Phillips had been stalking the guard for about a week, but detectives were still trying to find out more about that.

Bova said the guard was arriving at his apartment on Banbury Court when Phillips surprised him. The two struggled and Phillips stabbed the guard in the neck. They tumbled inside the apartment, where the guard retrieved a gun, Bova said.

"In defense of himself he fired one shot," Bova said.

Bova said detectives still were investigating where the gun was in the home. He said the guard’s mother was in the apartment but was not injured.

Police later discovered that in addition to the knife, Phillips was carrying a gun. Phillips died at the apartment of a gunshot wound to the upper body. Bova said the gun Phillips brought with him was not the one the guard used.

Sheriff’s Department spokesman Daniel Pukach said Jones is "a good officer, quiet and does his work." Jones has worked for the county for five years.
