Police identified the man who was shot dead by Phoenix police officers on Wednesday as 35-year-old Andrew Collins.

Officials say Collins shot at police who were chasing him and was fatally wounded when officers returned fire.

Police said they were looking for a suspect wanted for a felony warrant in the area around 1:10 a.m. on July 26 and saw Collins riding his bike. Police said that Collins matched the description of the suspect in question and tried to stop him.

Police said Collins then rode away on his bicycle to a field and fired a handgun at the officers who pursued him. The officers then returned fire and shot Collins, according to police. He was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

No officers were injured, according to police.

Records show Collins spent eight years in the Arizona Department of Corrections for convictions of kidnapping and trafficking in stolen property.

He had an open case in Maricopa County Superior Court and was charged with third-degree burglary, resisting arrest, two counts of possessing weapons by a prohibited person and two counts of aggravated assault.

Collins is one of 17 people shot and killed by law enforcement officers in Maricopa County this year.
