A man died one day after being tased by a Jeffersontown police officer.The incident happened on July 19th at Home Towne Studios of Louisville on Taylorsville Road. Police said someone told them a man had a "big knife" and was rolling around on the outdoor hallway of the motel. According to police, an officer chased Roberts and told him to drop the knife, but Roberts refused. The officer tased Roberts twice. The second time, Roberts was going down concrete steps, fell, and hit his head. He died from his injuries the next day at University of Louisville Hospital.Roberts' family members started asking their own questions when they said police weren't giving them information. They said people staying at the motel told them a different story. "He carried a knife on his side. He has for probably ten years. I'm sure he had it on his side. Did anyone see him waving a knife that we talked to at the hotel when we went? No. No one heard anybody say drop the knife, no one heard anything about a knife," Wells said. Roberts' mother said even if her son had survived, he never would have been the same. "He would still in no way be able to be in any way active or have a normal life. He would be in a nursing home on a ventilator," his mother Cynthia Roberts said. Family members want Jeffersontown police to review their policies when it comes to using a taser. The family asked police to show them body, dash, or taser video but were told the Jeffersontown Police Department does not have any of those cameras. Roberts said she hopes the department will add cameras for all of its officers. "To know exactly what happened, how it happened is very important. Those cameras would make a big difference," she said. Roberts was a father to a 4-year-old girl. His family said they will do whatever they can to make sure she remembers her dad. "That's the most important part because he was a great dad. He loved her so much and he can't be here to watch her grow up," Wells said. "I'm going to miss his smile. I'm going to miss Christmas morning with him. I'm going to miss his birthday. I'm going to miss every day and everything, honestly. How can you not miss your child in every way possible," Roberts said. Police said the officer who tased Roberts is on paid administrative leave while they investigate what happened. Once the investigation is complete it will be handed over to the Commonwealth's Attorney for review.
