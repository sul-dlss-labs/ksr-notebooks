FRESNO, Calif.

A jury has awarded $1.5 million dollars to the plantiff, the family of 23-year-old /*Stephen Willis*/. They sued the city and the police department after he was killed by two officers in March of 2009.

Investigators say the officers fired more than forty rounds, hitting Willis 14 times. His family said the officers had no reason to shoot him -- and were seeking damages from the city for Willis' death.

But Willis had a gun, and the officers said they believe he shot it.

The jury found Willis 80 percent responsible for the shooting, and Fresno Police Officer Greg Catton 20 percent responsible. The other officer involved in the shooting was cleared of any wrongdoing.
