An auto theft suspect who crashed a sport utility vehicle while leading Gardena police officers on a chase into South Los Angeles, killing his female passenger in the burning wreckage, was charged Thursday with murder, police said.

Candido Rivera, 28, of Los Angeles, whom officers yanked from the 1997 Honda CR-V seconds before it burst into flames, will appear in Torrance court once he is released from a hospital, police said.

Officers tried to pull Rivera over about 10:30 a.m. Tuesday when they checked his license plate and discovered the Honda was reported stolen in South Gate. Rivera allegedly took off. At one point, he allegedly rammed a police car. The three-minute chase headed north on Normandie Avenue to 99th Street, where Rivera struck another vehicle and slammed into a power pole.

The CR-V caught fire. The officers who had been chasing Rivera rescued him, but were unable to help the female passenger trapped in the seat next to him. The SUV ignited and became fully involved as officers looked on helplessly.

“It’s a really tragic situation for all involved,” Gardena police Lt. Steve Prendergast said.

Coroner’s officials identified the woman Thursday as 21-year-old Jacqueline Cortez. Where she lived was unknown.

The District Attorney’s Office on Thursday charged Rivera with felony counts of murder, fleeing a pursuing peace officer’s motor vehicle causing death, assault on a peace officer, and driving or taking a motor vehicle without consent with a prior. Prosecutors also charged him with misdemeanor counts of hit-and-run driving resulting in property damage and driving with a suspended or revoked license.

A complaint filed against him in Torrance court shows Rivera has multiple previous convictions for auto theft and burglary.

If convicted, Rivera would face at least 25 years to life for the murder charge alone.
