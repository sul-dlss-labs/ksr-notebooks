SUMMARY:

On June 26, 2019, at 12:42 p.m. a woman contacted her family members and advised them Eric Sandoval was armed with a handgun, making threats to harm her and she was being held against her will. The family member notified the Sheriff’s Department, and deputies responded to Sandoval’s home on Warren Vista Ave. Deputies arrived, and Sandoval refused to exit the home and would not let the victim leave.



Deputies requested the Specialized Enforcement Detail(SED/SWAT) and a negotiator to work with Sandoval. The negotiator communicated throughout the night with Sandoval, and shortly after 3:00 a.m. deputies heard gunshots inside the home. SED/SWAT deputies entered the home and found the victim with a gunshot wound. Moments later a deputy-involved shooting occurred between Sandoval and SED/SWAT deputies. The victim was airlifted to a local hospital in critical condition. Sandoval was pronounced deceased at the scene.



Specialized Investigators with the Homicide Detail responded to conduct the investigation. The investigation is ongoing.
