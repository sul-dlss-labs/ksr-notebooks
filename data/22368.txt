Vincennes – Indiana State Police are currently investigating the death of a Knox County inmate. Quintrell T. Brannon, 25, of Vincennes, was arrested last night at approximately 11:05 p.m. and died approximately 30 minutes later while in police custody at the Knox County Jail.



Vincennes Police received a complaint around 11:00 p.m. last night that Brannon was at the National Guard Armory on Niblack Boulevard and was being disorderly. After Vincennes Police and Knox County Sheriff Deputies arrived, Brannon continued to be disorderly and combative toward the officers. Police initially sprayed a chemical agent in Brannon’s eyes in an attempt to get him to comply with their orders, but he refused and continued to resist. A Knox County Sheriff Deputy eventually had to use a taser to subdue Brannon. He was arrested and taken to the Knox County Jail. At approximately



11:41 p.m. last night, a Knox County Jailer noticed Brannon was not breathing and immediately summoned an ambulance. Jailers initiated C.P.R. until medical personnel arrived. Brannon was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital where he was pronounced dead.



An autopsy is scheduled for later today.
