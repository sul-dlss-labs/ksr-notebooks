BEDFORD PARK | A 48-year-old Griffith man died of a heart attack Thursday after he was arrested by Bedford Park police, officers said.

Felton Frankley died at Advocate Christ Hospital after police responded to a call of a deceptive practice in progress about 4 p.m. Thursday at LaSalle Bank, 7250 S. Cicero Ave.

When police arrived, they saw a female suspect running from the bank and entering a parked car, police said. She then got out of the vehicle and fled the scene.

Frankley still was in the vehicle and was taken into custody, police said. He later complained he was having a difficult time breathing and was transported to Advocate Christ Hospital and Medical Center in Oak Lawn.

He was pronounced dead about 5:25 p.m. at the hospital, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Police still are searching for the female suspect involved in the incident.

Anyone with information on the incident should call the Bedford Park Police Department at (708) 458-3388.
