HOUSTON –

A Harris County sheriff's deputy fatally shot a man who pointed a gun at deputies, and refusing commands to put down his gun, a spokesman from the Sheriff's Office said.

The shooting occurred at a trailer on the 14200 block of Burnham Drive in southwest Harris County Sunday, investigators said.

"He came out from a room along a hallway, armed with a pistol and raised it to the deputies," said Deputy Thomas Gilliland, a public information officer for the Sheriff's Office.

Family of the dead man told KPRC2 identified him as Juan Carlos Cuadra, 23.

Deputies said Cuadra was fighting with neighbors on his front lawn around 7:30 a.m. Sunday before deputies arrived.

Deputies said they found Cuadra armed with a knife. He was accused of stabbing a man in the hand during the fight, officials said.

Cuadra then went into his trailer to retrieve a gun, came back out and fired several times into the ground, deputies said.

That is when a neighbor called 911, investigators said.

Authorities said when officers arrived, Cuadra ran back into his trailer. Deputies said they went into the trailer to talk to him.

Deputies said Cuadra came out of his bedroom with his gun pointed at them, which caused a deputy to shoot him.

Cuadra was taken to Ben Taub hospital, where he later died.

The Sheriff’s Department said the deputy involved in the shooting is under investigation.
