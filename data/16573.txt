IBERIA â€“ An early morning pursuit involving Morrow County Sheriff's Office deputies and a 17-year-old on an all-terrain vehicle ended in the death of the driver, identified by authorities as Devon Abbott.

Shortly after 3 a.m., Abbott was driving down County Road 9 and attempted to turn onto Ohio 309 when he apparently lost control as the ATV slid, overturned and rolled over the guard rail into a yard, the sheriff's office reported. Deputies called an ambulance and began CPR, but Abbott was pronounced dead at Galion Community Hospital.

At 1:30 a.m., suspicious people were reported along a railroad track near Westview Drive in Mount Gilead, and the people ran when a law enforcement officer approached, the sheriff's office said. One juvenile was arrested following a foot pursuit, officials reported, and an ATV was found on the railroad tracks. A short investigation found there had been a burglary at Extreme Tec ATV in Mount Gilead, officials said.

At around 3 a.m., Mount Gilead and Cardington police officers and Morrow County deputies were still searching the area when they reported they heard an ATV take off, heading north. They began pursuing the vehicle, which was traveling "at a high rate of speed," according to a news release, and began using lights and sirens.

Nearing the intersection of County Road 9 and Ohio 309, law enforcement officials said they backed off from the pursuit and began using an electronic horn. The vehicle did not stop and attempted to turn left onto Ohio 309, at which time the rider lost control, the sheriff's office said.

Three juveniles were taken into custody in connection with the burglary, and the entire incident is being investigated by the Mount Gilead Police Department, Morrow County Sheriff's Office and Ohio State Highway Patrol.
