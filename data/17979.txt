SAN BERNARDINO >> A man was shot and killed by San Bernardino police early Wednesday after reportedly charging at an officer with a hunting knife, according to a police news release.

The fatal incident took place 12:19 a.m. in the 1800 block of North Mt. Vernon Avenue, the news release states. Police were assisting a mentally ill person there on a separate call when a passing motorist told officers of a man — later identified as Saddam Trejeda-Campos, 24, of San Bernardino — acting suspicious.

When an officer “attempted to make contact” with Trejeda-Campos, the news release states, he charged the officer with a hunting knife. After Trejeda-Campos reportedly ignored numerous commands to drop the knife and show his hands, at least one officer fired two shots at him. Trejeda-Campos died later at a local hospital.

“The behavior leading to the shooting appeared be caused by drugs/and or mental illness,” the news release states. Spokesperson Eileen Hards said police were familiar with Trejeda-Campos for previous, unspecified incdients.

Police recovered the knife at the scene, the news release states.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call 909-384-5747 or 909-384-5615.
