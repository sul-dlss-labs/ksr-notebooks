Three dead in Natchez accident Published 7:36 pm Friday, July 6, 2007

Authorities said three people, including two from Vidalia, La., were killed late Wednesday when their truck plunged down a 60-foot embankment in Natchez and hit a tree.

A fourth person in the vehicle, identified as Michael “Cody” McJohnson of Vidalia, was taken to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Police Chief Mike Mullins said Thursday. McJohnson’s condition was not immediately known.

Mullins said the accident occurred about 11:30 p.m. Wednesday.

The people killed were all passengers in the truck. They were identified as Nicholas Kirby and Justin Wiley, both in their 20s and from Vidalia, and Kristin Holmes, 15, of Woodville, Miss.

Mullins said police got a call about a fight at a nightclub when one of the officers clocked the truck, reportedly coming from the club, driving at 86 mph.

The officer turned around to follow the truck, Mullins said.

“He never got close to them,” said Mullins, who said the truck skidded, went down the embankment and hit the tree.

Mullins said the three victims were pronounced dead at the scene.

He said the accident was under investigation.
