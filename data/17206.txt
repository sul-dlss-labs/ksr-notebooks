HAMMOND â€” A two-hour standoff involving a resident and police Sunday night ended in a suicide, officials said.

Luis Torres Jr., 25, was found dead inside a home in the 7800 block of Northcote Avenue in Hammond, according to the Lake County coroner's office. He suffered a gunshot wound to the head.

Hammond police were called to the home about 8 p.m. for a potentially suicidal man, Lt. Richard Hoyda said.

A Hammond police sergeant responded and told police he could see a man with a handgun inside the home from his police vehicle.

"Several attempts were made to establish communication with the subject by officers at the scene but those attempts were met without success," Hoyda said in a statement issued Monday morning.

The Hammond police SWAT team entered the home about 10 p.m. and found a 25-year-old man inside a bedroom with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

A 9mm handgun was recovered from inside the home, Hoyda said.
