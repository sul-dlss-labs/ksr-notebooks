NATCHEZ (AP) â€” The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation says police shot and killed a 25-year-old Natchez man who fought with and then shot at officers investigating a highway wreck.

Spokesman Warren Strain said Sunday that Justin Tyler Harrigill died late Saturday night on Interstate 55 South about a mile south of Crystal Springs.

Strain said in a news release that Harrigill became uncooperative after a state trooper found his wrecked car about 10:30 p.m. Saturday. He says the trooper called for help, and more troopers, Crystal Springs police and firefighters, and a hospital rescue crew responded.
