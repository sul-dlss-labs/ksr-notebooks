Luis Salinas, 23, a Latino man, was shot multiple times by a police officer at 15444 Nordhoff St. in the San Fernando Valley. He died at 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 11.

The incident took place in a church parking lot at Langdon Avenue and Rayen Street in the north San Fernando Valley, police said. Salinas had been driving a car that collided with other cars in a series of accidents just prior to the shooting. At the church, he attacked a male employee. A pursuing officer from LAPD's Mission station, Officer Jerold Chase, 33, tried to pull him off the employee. Salinas, police said, somehow got Chase's baton out of its ring and hit him with it, striking the officer's head. Knocked to the ground, Chase fired his weapon, killing Salinas.
