A Chattanooga Police officer shot and killed a man who police said was armed with a gun and a knife on Woodland View Circle near Emma Wheeler Homes on Saturday.

Just before noon, Chattanooga Police responded to the 5113 Woodland View Circle in response to a mental health/unknown trouble call.

Hamilton County 911 received a call from an individual making unusual demands, police said.

Chattanooga Police were dispatched to the residence to make contact with the caller.

Once on the scene, police encountered an armed individual at the residence with a small child. Police said the armed suspect exited and entered his house multiple times, refusing to comply with directions from police.

The Chattanooga SWAT/HNT team was requested by officers on scene due to the potential for a hostage situation.

The man then exited the house holding the small child and brandishing both a knife and a firearm, it was stated.

The small child was able to get out of reach of the suspect and was rescued by a Chattanooga Police officer.

Police said during the rescue of the child, "the armed suspect moved aggressively toward the officer and small child while brandishing the weapons. Officers on scene used corresponding force to subdue the suspect."

He was transported to a local hospital where he received treatment but succumbed to his injuries.

He was identified as Javario Shante Eagle, 24.
