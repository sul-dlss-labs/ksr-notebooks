Corpus Christi Police Chief Floyd Simpson provided some new details Thursday regarding an officer-involved shooting that left one man dead on Christmas Eve.

The shooting happened around 11:15 p.m. Tuesday in the 4100 block of Herndon Street, near Staples. When police arrived on scene, the bullets were directed at them instead. They returned fire and killed the suspect, who was identified as 44-year old Michael Rosales.

"In my view, this is a very unfortunate situation," Simpson said. "All indications, from what we have right now, our officers responded very professionally. They did the job they were trained to do. Again, it's unfortunate. Certainly, hearts go out to that family."

Authorities said they received multiple calls on Christmas Eve that Rosales was firing shots at his girlfriend. According to Chief Simpson, when police arrived on the scene, Rosales displayed two guns and began to fire at officers.

The media was actually allowed to see dash cam footage of the incident, but the Nueces County District Attorney advised that police not to release the video to the public. In it, you can see police take cover behind their vehicles and return fire. Rosales was hit several times and was later pronounced dead at the hospital.

According to witnesses, Rosales had been drinking all day.

The three officers who were involved -- Officer Katha McAlister, Senior Officer Adam Villarreal and Senior Officer Enrique Roman -- have been placed on paid administrative leave.

"In order to give them time to decompress, and also a series of interviews with on-staff psychologist, and then we will bring them back slowly," Simpson said. "They won't be gone long."

According to Chief Simpson, each officer fired two bullets. An autopsy will be performed on Rosales after the holidays.
