COLLIER COUNTY, Fla. -- Florida Highway Patrol is investigating a single car crash that killed two people in Immokalee overnight.

Immokalee Fire Department and Florida Highway Patrol reports the vehicle crashed into a pole just before midnight Tuesday night at the intersection of State Road 29 and New Market Road.

According to the Collier County Sheriff's Office, a deputy attempted to make a traffic stop on Roberts Avenue for not having lights on the car's license plate. Deputies say the car turned into Immokalee Community Park and accelerated away from deputies.

The car's driver ran a stop sign and accelerated to over 60 miles per hour along Roberts Avenue before turning onto New Market Road, where they ran another stop sign and sped off.

As the car traveled north on New Market Road, deputies say the driver tailgated other vehicles, passed in the other lane, and hit approximately 100 miles per hour.

The car's driver failed to negotiate the curve in the road at the intersection with State Road 29 and smashed into a tree and a concrete power pole.

Both occupants of the car were pronounced dead at the scene. They have been identified as 21-year-old Damian Rivera, the driver, and 24-year-old Amy Manzano, the passenger.

Troopers say neither were wearing seat belts, and it is unknown if alcohol was a factor in the crash.

The intersection was shut down for several hours early Wednesday, but has since reopened.

Fox 4 has crews on the scene monitoring the situation.

Troopers continue to investigate the crash.
