The boyfriend of a Tulsa woman who has been missing since early November appeared to have fatally shot himself while officers attempted to enter his home Wednesday, according to authorities.

Police believe Samantha Puckett’s boyfriend barricaded himself in the home in the 2600 block of North Utica Avenue while officers with a search warrant were knocking on his door around 10 a.m., homicide Sgt. Dave Walker said.

When the officers forced their way through the door, they reportedly smelled gunpowder and found the man lying dead on the floor with a gun in his hand.

“Nobody heard the gunshot, but that’s because they were beating down the door,” Walker said.

Police had been wanting to question the man, whose name has not been released, in connection with the disappearance of his girlfriend. Puckett, 29, has not had contact with her family since Nov. 7.

Officers were seeking information regarding Puckett’s whereabouts and hoped her boyfriend would be able to provide some answers, said Walker, who added that Wednesday was the first time police attempted to contact him.

Police said Puckett’s family has reported a history of domestic abuse over the course of the woman’s relationship with the man. There also is medical documentation that backs up the allegations of abuse, though Walker said Puckett never called police on her boyfriend.

The Tulsa police homicide unit became involved due to the circumstances of the case.

“The family thinks she’s dead. She hasn’t been heard from,” Walker said. “That’s a little unusual.”

Investigators are not calling Puckett’s boyfriend a suspect due to the lack of information concerning what happened to her. Walker said it’s possible she is still alive.
