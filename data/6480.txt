PERSON COUNTY, N.C. — A 28-year-old Durham man died Monday afternoon during a police chase on U.S. Highway 501 near the Durham-Person County line.

According to the Person County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were chasing the vehicle when it crossed over the median and struck another vehicle head-on.

The driver, Clarence Leon Davis, was killed, and Earl Bailey, who was inside the second vehicle, was injured.

Officers with the Roxboro Police Department said they had a checkpoint set up and that Davis turned around about 500 yards prior to arriving at the checkpoint.

A supervisor gave other officers a BOLO over the radio for the vehicle. According to Chief David Hess, Roxboro Police officers never pursued the vehicle, and the BOLO was standard procedure.

“Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and deputies involved in this horrific tragedy. Anytime someone chooses to flee danger increases. Simply complying with traffic laws may have allowed this incident not to occur. This is a tragic loss of life,” Hess said.

"“It’s a tragic thing. It really burns me to see people get hurt, much less get killed. It’s just tragic for everyone involved. It potentially could’ve been avoided if people would’ve just complied with the checkpoint.”

The North Carolina Highway Patrol is investigating the incident.
