Police have identified a 57-year-old Staunton man shot hours before his attacker died during a standoff on Interstate 81.

Ralph E. Siron was shot on the 200 block of Stonewall Jackson Boulevard at approximately 9:40 a.m. Tuesday. Police believe 56-year-old Willa C. Good fired the shots.

Siron was treated at the scene and taken to the University of Virginia Medical Center, according to a news release.

The Staunton shooting occurred about an hour before a state trooper stopped Good for speeding on I-81 near mile marker 161 in Botetourt County. When Good displayed a firearm, police blocked traffic and attempted to negotiate with Good. She was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The standoff lasted about five hours and forced officials to redirect traffic on both northbound and southbound lanes.

Staunton police officials said Thursday that they are not releasing any more information about the shooting or Good at this time.
