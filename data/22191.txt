BELLMAWR - A man who had barricaded himself in an apartment here was shot to death after apparently confronting police with knife.

A Brooklawn police officer fired two rounds from his service weapon, killing Michael Wood, 37, a spokesman for Camden County Prosecutor Warren Faulk said Friday.

Police responded to a report of several 9-1-1 hang up calls at the Bellmawr Manor Apartments in the 1100 block of Kings Highway about 10:20 p.m. Thursday. Two Bellmawr officers and a Brooklawn officer responded. They were informed that Wood, 37, was apparently barricaded in a relative’s apartment where he had been staying. Based on information received from the tenant of the apartment, officers entered the apartment and found Wood inside holding a knife, spokesman Jason Laughlin said.

The officer who fired the fatal shots has 15 years experience as a law enforcement officer, Laughlin said. The officer was not identified.

The officer has been placed on administrative leave per Camden County Prosecutor’s Office policy whenever a police officer’s use of a firearm when on duty results in death. County investigators will interview the officers present and other witnesses. Notification has also been made to the state Attorney General’s Office, Laughlin said.
