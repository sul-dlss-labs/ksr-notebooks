UPDATE: 2:03 PM

Washington County Sheriff Richard Stringer says the shooting involved a Washington County Deputy who shot a suspect trying to evade authorities on Hwy 45 in a stolen truck. Stringer says this started with Mississippi State Troopers pursuing suspect Christopher Michael Murray through Lauderdale County. When Murray crossed the state line into Alabama members of the Washington County Sheriff’s Office picked up the chase.

Stringer says Murray was weaving in and out of traffic and tried to ram into law enforcement cars as he headed south on 45 towards Mobile County. Stringer gave the order for officers to shoot out one of the tires on the truck in an effort to stop him, but Murray continued for two more miles until one of the officers pulled a maneuver to get the truck into the grass on the side of the road. That’s when Stringer said Murray tried to ram into the officer, so the officer made the decision to fire his gun, killing Murray.

Stringer said they were worried he was going to kill somebody with the way he was driving, and said Mississippi authorities had already called an ambulance before he crossed over the state line out of the same concern.

Murray was traveling with a woman named Kacie Lea Likely, who is currently being held at the Washington County Jail for questioning.

Washington County authorities contacted the State Bureau of Investigation to look into the incident as a third party.
