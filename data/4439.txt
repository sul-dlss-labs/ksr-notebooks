Police investigating a shooting on Chicago's South Side shot and killed a man whom officers said brandished a gun early Monday.

Jimmy Pudar, 25, of the 800 block of West 54th Street was fatally shot by two detectives and a plainclothes officer who were in the Washington Heights neighborhood investigating an earlier shooting, police spokesman Sgt. Robert Cargie said.

Officers in the area heard a radio call about 1:10 a.m. of a man carrying a gun and rushed to 89th Street and Justine Avenue, Cargie said. They arrived at the scene and chased Pudar on foot to the 9000 block of South Justine Avenue, where he turned and pointed the gun at the officers, Cargie said.

Pudar was shot in front of the house and then stumbled to the rear of the property, where he fell. A handgun was found at the spot where Pudar was shot, Cargie said.

Pudar was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead an hour later.

Police are investigating whether the earlier shooting of Anthony Mason in the 1400 block of West 91st Street was related to Pudar carrying a gun, Cargie said.

Police officials have preliminarily ruled that the officers followed department guidelines for using lethal force, Cargie said.

Pudar's shooting came less than 24 hours after an off-duty police officer shot and wounded a man in the 7700 block of South Keating Avenue in Chicago after the man allegedly brandished a fake gun.

Police officials also ruled preliminarily that the officer acted properly in that shooting.
