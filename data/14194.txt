A man who was shot and killed by a deputy in Pompano Beach Sunday following a report that he had a machete was fired upon after he refused to comply with a deputy's commands, Broward Sheriff's Office officials said Monday.

Deosaran Maharaj, 51, died Sunday following a traffic stop near the Marathon Gas Station at Hammondville Road and Northwest 31 Avenue, Broward Sheriff's Office Public Information Officer Dani Moschella confirmed Monday.



The shooting happened after a woman said she was threatened by a man with a machete at the gas station, according to officials. The woman approached the deputy to tell them about the threat then walked with the deputy outside of the convenience store to point the man out.



Maharaj drove off in his white truck and the deputy followed him and pulled him over.

Maharaj, who at one point got out of the truck was "was completely ignoring" orders from Deputy Paul Yesbeck to show his hands and get on the ground, instead going to look in the back of the truck, Moschella said.

"The deputy felt threatened at that point and was forced to shoot. He shot multiple times," Moschella said. "At least one of those shots fatally injured the man, who had gotten back into the pick up."



The BSO initially indicated that Maharaj was living at the Motel 6 near the gas station, but now says it is unclear where he lived. One man who said he knew the subject said he sold coconuts in the area and used the machete to open the coconuts.

“He sold his coconuts to make a little extra money," the neighbor said. "He worked. He was a nice islander.”

BSO officials said coconuts, as well as a machete, were found in the bed of the man's truck.

Detectives, who are still investigating the shooting, ask that the woman who initially reported being threatened by Maharaj contact them at (954) 321-4210.
