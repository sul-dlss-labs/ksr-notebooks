JACKSON COUNTY, Ala. — The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office has identified the person who died as a result of a deputy-involved shooting Tuesday evening. That person is Alex Christopher Davis, 18, of Pisgah.

The Jackson County Sheriff’s Office received a call just before 6 p.m. about an assault on County Road 60.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, Davis came at the deputy with a board. The deputy asked him to stop repeatedly. He also tried to subdue the teenager with his stun gun twice. Investigators say Davis was able to regain strength and pull the electrodes off him to pursue the deputy again. That’s when the deputy shot Davis, who died at the scene.

Investigators say that Davis had assaulted someone at the home and was knocking windows out of a car when a deputy arrived. We spoke with the victim in the initial assault call who says Davis got in their altercation after Davis argued with someone else. They fought for roughly ten minutes before law enforcement officers arrived.
