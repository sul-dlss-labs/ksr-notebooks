Authorities this week identified a man who died while fighting with sheriff’s deputies outside his home in Lake Los Angeles.

The altercation occurred about at 4:30 p.m. Feb. 3 in the 40000 block of 176th Street East, Deputy Armando Vierra Jr. of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau said.

Jeremy Spencer, 47, of Lake Los Angeles died at the scene, the coroner’s office reported. An autopsy was pending to determine the cause of death.

Deputies went to the scene looking for a man who had been making threats, and they found the man — later identified as Spencer — in the backyard of his home, according to Deputy Wally Bracks of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau.

Initially, Spencer complied with orders to put his hands behind his back, but he turned around and punched one of the two deputies, who fell to the ground, Bracks said. He then straddled the deputy’s chest and continued the attack, Bracks said.

The deputy’s partner used a Taser on Spencer, but it had no effect, Bracks said. Spencer then knocked the second deputy to the ground before nearby residents jumped in to help take him into custody, Bracks said.

Spencer continued to fight while in handcuffs, and deputies noticed his breathing became labored as he calmed down, Bracks said. Deputies and firefighters administered CPR after he became unresponsive, but those efforts were unsuccessful, authorities said.

The two deputies were treated for minor injuries at a hospital and released, Bracks said.

Anyone with information on the case was urged to call the Sheriff’s homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500.
