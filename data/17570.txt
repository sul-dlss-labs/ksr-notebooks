PITTSBURG (CBS SF) â€“ A Concord man is facing murder charges after he allegedly struck and killed a pedestrian while fleeing police Tuesday in Pittsburg, according to the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office.

The man, 26-year-old Aroldo Vela-Chavez, allegedly collided with a woman and then went crashing through a Pittsburg golf course's fence after an officer caught him speeding at about 7:45 a.m. Tuesday, according to police.

Charges of murder, fleeing a police officer and causing serious injury or death as well as vehicular manslaughter have been filed against Vela-Chavez in connection with the incident, district attorney's officials said today.

Vela-Chavez was arrested shortly after a brief pursuit that began when he was seen speeding on eastbound West Leland Road, police said.

Instead of complying with a traffic stop, Vela-Chavez allegedly accelerated and headed into heavy commute traffic, police said. The pursuit then had to be called off for safety reasons.

Less than a mile away, at West Leland and Golf Club roads, a woman was struck while walking along a sidewalk. Vela-Chavez's vehicle allegedly struck her then broke through the fence at Delta View Golf Course, according to police.

The vehicle continued onto the golf course before it was abandoned, police said. The suspect fled on foot and was later found and taken into custody several blocks away, police said.

The pedestrian who was struck, identified as 65-year-old Pittsburg resident Linda Cochran, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said Vela-Chavez was determined to be driving on a suspended license for a prior DUI arrest.

Pittsburg police were investigating if impaired driving played a role in the incident but were not immediately available today to confirm whether that was still being considered as a potential factor.

Vela-Chavez is scheduled to make an appearance in a Martinez courtroom on Thursday afternoon.
