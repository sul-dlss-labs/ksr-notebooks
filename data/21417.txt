The Greenville County sheriff held a news conference Friday afternoon where he shared details of a deadly shootout between nine deputies and a man who had just killed a woman, and he released dash cam video of the gunfight.(Note: The video has been partially blurred out of sensitivity to the family of the woman who was killed.)Sheriff Will Lewis said deputies were called just after 4 p.m. on July 14 to White Horse Road near the McAfee Funeral Home about an armed man chasing a woman.The man, later identified as Ramiro Bravo Ramirez, 34, of Greenville, fatally shot Candy Rosario, 25, of Greenville, as she ran across White Horse Road. “He came to kill that woman,” Lewis said. “He shot her like a dog on the side of the road.”When deputies confronted Ramirez, he began to fire at them, Lewis said. Deputies fired back, and when backup deputies reached the scene, they joined the gunfight that continued until Ramirez was dead.Lewis said Ramirez had two gun magazines with him and reloaded his weapon during the gunfight. He also said Ramirez used Rosario’s body as a barricade to avoid being shot by deputies.Two deputies who are also paramedics cared for Rosario at the scene until EMS arrived about 15 minutes later. She was taken to Greenville Memorial Hospital where she was pronounced dead just before 5:30 p.m.Coroner Parks Evans later determined that Ramirez died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Lewis said that it was not a case of suicide by cop, it was just a suicide.Lewis said that Rosario and Ramirez were in a relationship and had children together. He said the shooting was a domestic violence case and “it could not have been prevented.” He said Ramirez was intent on killing Rosario, and unless a deputy happened to be in the parking lot at the time of the shooting, nothing would have stopped him.Lewis said that shootout was caught on dashcam that will be released soon, and the video is “all encompassing.” He said he will not release deputies’ body cam, because it shows them dragging Rosario out of harm’s way and providing medical care during which he body is exposed, and he’s not going to put her family through that.Lewis said all of the deputies were put on administrative leave until an internal investigation found that they violated no policies and all Sheriff’s Office protocol was met. They were reinstated to full duty July 25.
