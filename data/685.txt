A 29-year-old woman who was recently hired as a guard for the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service was shot and killed and a man was wounded early yesterday in the woman's Brooklyn home, the authorities said.

The woman, identified by the police as Juliette Alexander, had been shot several times in the head and face and died at the scene. The wounded man, who was identified as Nigel Callendar, 32, was shot in the neck and hand and was listed in serious but stable condition last night at Kings County Hospital Center.

Ms. Alexander had two children with a New York Police Department sergeant, from whom she was estranged, and detectives were questioning him last night, said Lt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman. But officials would not call the sergeant, Martin Peters, 37, as a suspect.

George M. Cerrone, a lawyer for the Sergeants Benevolent Association, said Sergeant Peters was cooperating with the investigation and was being questioned because a member of his family was the victim of a crime. Mr. Cerrone also said the sergeant had turned both of his weapons over to investigators, who had determined that neither had been recently fired.
