PHOENIX â€” Phoenix police were involved in a deadly shooting Monday morning near Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.

Officers responded to a reported violation of an order of protection around 9:45 a.m. at a home near 40th and Van Buren streets. Police say the suspect visited his parents' home, which was against the court order. He left by the time officers arrived.

Police remained in the area and found the suspect walking along the canal near 32nd Street and Roosevelt. Police say he had a sheet wrapped around an object that appeared to be a gun.

The suspect pointed the suspected weapon at officers several times before one fired, hitting the suspect.

The suspect, who was identified only as 26-year-old Alejandro Hernandez, was later pronounced dead at the hospital. No officers were injured in the incident.

The 40-year-old officer who fired his weapon has been with the department for 11 years, police said. None of the involved officers were wearing body cameras at the time of the incident.

Investigators say a replica rifle was recovered from the scene.
