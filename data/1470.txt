Chicago police officials on Friday ruled that an off-duty officer acted correctly in the fatal shooting of a 30-year-old Southwest Side man who allegedly held him up at gunpoint Thursday night.

Police said Robert Winters of the 6600 block of South Knox Avenue tried to rob the 50-year-old police lieutenant at about 10:15 p.m. as the officer was returning to his home in the Garfield Ridge neighborhood.

Winters approached the officer, put a gun to his head and demanded his wallet, according to police spokesman Pat Camden. After some resistance, the officer agreed to give up his wallet.

Winters then fled down an alley, but the officer chased him and declared himself a police officer, said Camden. He said Winters turned and pointed his gun at the officer.

Camden said that "the officer was in fear of his life and shot to protect himself."

Camden said Winters did not fire his gun. Police said they recovered a .357 Magnum that was in Winters' possession.

A Cook County medical examiner's office spokesman said Winters died of multiple gunshot wounds.

A panel of department officials convened soon after the shooting and classified as "procedurally compliant" the actions taken by the officer.

Police would not identify the officer, except to say he has been on the force since 1975. But property records list Gary Szparkowski as an owner of the house where the incident occurred. He is a police lieutenant who joined the force in May 1975.

Police said a second man, who they believe was working with Winters, fled the scene in a black pickup truck.
