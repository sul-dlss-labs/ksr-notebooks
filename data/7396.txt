Authorities are investigating a partially decomposed body found in the rural Greenview area.

The body of a man was discovered off Rabbit Road Sunday by a motorist who went to check on a neighbor’s house, according to information provided by the Camden County Sheriff’s Department.

The body, found partially inside a vehicle, was in the advanced stages of decomposition and is believed to have been in the vehicle for at least a week, according to the sheriff’s department.

There were no signs of trauma or evidence of foul play, according to the sheriff’s department. The man is believed to be local, but no one had reported him missing.

The body was taken to Springfield, Mo., for an autopsy to determine the cause of death and to identify the remains.

Anyone with information is urged to contact the Camden County Sheriff’s Department at 346-2243.
