EVERETT — A man was fatally shot in Everett late Saturday after he reportedly tried to grab a Lynnwood police officer’s gun while struggling during an arrest.

The Lynnwood officers were looking for the man, 44, in connection with a domestic violence incident about five hours earlier. That happened in the 17500 block of 54th Place W, and involved the man reportedly making threats to kill his girlfriend, said Shari Ireton, a spokeswoman for the Snohomish County Multi-Agency Response Team.

Lynnwood officers went to the man’s home in the 3900 block of Friday Avenue. He also was wanted on a state Department of Corrections warrant, she said.

The man reportedly fled and was spotted by Lynnwood officers in the 3900 block of Grand Avenue at about 11:30 p.m.

He struggled with the officers.

“Initial witness reports indicate the suspect attempted to grab the officer’s gun. A Lynnwood officer shot the suspect and he died at the scene,” she said.

The death is being investigated by SMART, a team of detectives from throughout the county who handle cases involving police use of deadly force.

The officer who shot has been with Lynnwood police for four years, Ireton said.

No other information about the dead man was immediately available pending an autopsy by the Snohomish County Medical Examiner.
