MOBILE, Alabama -- The man killed in an early morning officer-involved shooting on Bonneville Drive Friday has been identified as Ray Anson Mitchell, 37, a Mobile Police Department spokesman said.

Mitchell was shot by officers after he tried to shoot a Taser gun he had wrestled from police at an officer, said MPD spokesman Cpl. Christopher Levy.

He had already Tased a female officer, said MPD spokeswoman Ashley Rains.

No other officers were injured in the confrontation, according to police.

Around 4:30 a.m. police were called to a reported prowler outside a home on the 700 block of Bonneville Drive, Levy said.

When they arrived they found Mitchell in the caller's yard. He "engaged the officers in a physical confrontation," prompting officers to Tase him, Levy said.

The Taser gun had no effect on him and police are investigating why, Rains said.

"When Mitchell attempted to Tase a second officer, the officers then fired shots striking Mitchell," Levy said in a news release.

He was pronounced dead on the scene.

It is the second time officers have fatally shot a man in two days after 36-year-old Kenneth Lamar Bedgood was killed while attempting to flee from police Thursday.

Detectives with the internal affairs and homicide units are investigating. Anyone with information can call MPD at 251-208-7211.
