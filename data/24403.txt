On Friday, Lubbock Police said an investigation was started because of an in-custody death.

“We regret the loss of human life,” Lubbock Police Chief Greg Stevens said. “It’s something that weighs heavily on anyone that’s in this business.”

Stevens said at 7:38 Friday morning, police and EMS were called to the 2300 block of 31st Street. There was a report of a disturbance and a man “in distress.”

Police encountered Albert Guerra, 35, and the officers discovered that he had an outstanding warrant for his arrest. Stevens said the warrant was for a misdemeanor.

Officers then told Guerra that he would be placed under arrest.

“Once we tell someone they are under arrest, from that point forward they are considered to be in our custody,” Stevens said.

There was a struggle in the house, and Stevens said the struggle spilled out of the house and into the front yard.

Stevens said officers shocked Guerra multiple times with a stun gun. They were able to get handcuffs on Guerra. But then he became unresponsive.

EMS was there to immediately begin providing medical care. Guerra was taken to University Medical Center where he was then pronounced dead.

Stevens said he would not speculate if Guerra was under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

A police report said someone who called police said he was “high on meth.” Stevens said an autopsy would provide more information.

Two officers were on scene, Stevens said. A supervisor was on the way, but had not arrived yet. The two officers were placed on administrative leave as part of an investigation.
