This is a friend of mine's cousin....please keep the family in your prayers.The mother was notified of her son's deathhours later, and as of today, she has not seen her son's body, nor does she know the cause of death. Also, the article is not correct. He died in the police car while being transported to jail. The ambulance arrived at the scene, but left because he didn't require their assistance. The mother is visiting with Senator Royce West who will perform his own investigation as well as their own autopsy. The mother spoke with Chief Bolton, who supports his arresting officers and showed NO support or sympathy for the family. :smh: Keenon was only 27 years old.
