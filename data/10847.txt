OVERLAND â€¢ The Overland police officer who fatally shot a knife-wielding Charlack man in a municipal park on Monday afternoon will be back on patrol today. The officer's chief has deemed the shooting justified.

Police also on Friday identified the dead man: Jerry Lee Mann, 68, of the 6800 block of Forest Avenue in Charlack.

Mann's identity wasn't released for days. Overland Police Chief Michael Laws said that's because police and the medical examiner's office were giving the family time to notify Mann's grown children, including one in the military who was hard to contact.

Mann was fatally shot at about 4 p.m. Monday in Norman Myers Park on Midland Boulevard near Interstate 170. Police say Mann had threatened and walked toward the officer with a hunting knife.

Mann lived near the park. He was taken to DePaul Hospital, where he died several hours later of his injuries.

Laws said the unidentified officer warned Mann repeatedly to drop the weapon. When Mann didn't drop it, the officer fired one shot.

The officer was put on paid administrative leave while the shooting was being investigated, which is standard procedure. Laws said St. Louis County police were conducting an investigation of their own, and Laws on Friday said he hadn't seen the final report. But Laws said he deemed the shooting justified, so the officer is going to be on patrol Friday.

"Had (the officer) chosen a less lethal form of force and it wasn't effective, his life would have been in peril," Laws said afte the shooting. "This incident, it happened seconds after (the officer) arrived on the scene. Given that, I don't think he had an option."

Laws said he doesn't know what led to the man wielding the knife at the officer.

"It was very sad situation," Laws said. "No question about that, for all concerned. Something was going on with this guy, but I don't know exactly what was going on with him."
