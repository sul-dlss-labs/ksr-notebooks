A Hattiesburg teenager involved in a deadly high speed chase with authorities has been charged with two counts of manslaughter. The 30-mile high speed chase between Collins and Hattiesburg on Aug. 16 left two people dead. Hattiesburg Police Lt. Hardy Sims said Wednesday the female driver was charged a week ago when she was released from Forrest General Hospital. Sims said the identity of the driver is being withheld pending the outcome of a hearing in the Forrest County Youth Court to determine whether she will be charged as an adult.

The pursuit began when the teenager would not stop for a speeding violation in Collins, police there said. The Collins officer, who was joined by a Mississippi Highway Safety Patrol trooper, chased the car into Hattiesburg where it collided with another vehicle on U.S. 49. Hattiesburg residents Marlene Pratt, 49, the driver of second vehicle, and Jarriett T. Huey, 16, a passenger in the teen's car, were killed. A second juvenile passenger and the driver were hospitalized.

The driver of the fleeing vehicle was charged with driving without a license and insurance in Hattiesburg. She faces misdemeanor charges of speeding and failure to yield to blue lights from Collins, police said.
