[T]wo witnesses who said they were on a third-floor balcony 10 yards away say Hawkins threw his weapon away before the officer arrived.

“He threw the gun onto the roof next door but it slid off and fell three floors to the ground below,” one said.

“The cop arrived five seconds later, saw the gun on the floor, then ran up the stairs and shot the man,” added the witness, whose account matched that of the second witness. ...

The first witness said she did not come forward immediately because, “I wanted to see how the police played it.” She added, “Why did they have to twist the story?”
