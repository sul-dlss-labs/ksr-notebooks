A driver killed in a high-speed crash while fleeing Sheboygan County sheriff's deputies was identified by the State Patrol Thursday as Steven Lutz, 49, of Germantown.

According to a news release from the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Office, shortly after 7 p.m. Wednesday, Lutz fled from deputies who tried to pull him over on Foster Road in the Town of Holland after he was reported to be driving erratically.

Lutz reached speeds of more than 100 mph before he struck a utility pole and was thrown from his vehicle, the release said.

The crash remained under investigation Thursday.
