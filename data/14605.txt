A 29-year-old Point of Rocks man was killed Thursday when his motorcycle left the road as he fled from a Maryland State Police traffic stop near Hagerstown, authorities said.

Zachary A. Macintosh, of the 1600 block of Gibbons Road, was pronounced dead around 1 p.m. along eastbound Route 40 near Beverly Road, where his 1999 Suzuki GSXR-750 motorcycle went off the road, State Police said.

Hagerstown Barrack commander Lt. Michael Fluharty saw a man on a motorcycle, later identified as Macintosh, going between 75 and 80 mph in a 45 mph zone, and tried to pull him over, State Police said. The motorcyclist ignored Fluharty's lights and sirens, accelerating away on eastbound Route 40, State Police said. The chase lasted less than a minute, and Fluharty stopped following when the motorcyclist ran a red light, State Police said. Less than a mile away, Macintosh and his motorcycle were found off a curve in the road, where he apparently lost control, State Police said.

State Police are investigating.
