Last Thursday around 7 a.m., a Houston Police Traffic Enforcement Officer spotted a motorcycle travelling at a high rate of speed on US 59 near Northpark. The driver, identified as Alfredo Tovar, 34, of Houston, was riding his motorcycle and taunting police by revving his engine and popping wheelies while they were on a traffic stop.

The officer pursued Tovar but lost him when the motorcycle exited the freeway. Moments later, he saw Tovar on Loop 494 at Northpark in the Kingwood area. Tovar fleed north on Loop 494 when the officer attempted to stop him again. They approached the intersection of Martin Drive and Tovar looked back at the officer, failed to see the red light ahead of him, and ran into the intersection. In doing so, he slammed into a Ford Mustang and spun into a Ford pick-up.

Tovar was ejected and died at the scene. It was determined that his motorcycle had been stolen in Houston last January.

There were no other injuries.

Loop 494 at Martin remained closed until after 10 a.m. while Houston Police investigated the crash.

Justice of the Peace James Metts ordered Eickenhorst Funeral Directors to transport the victim to the Montgomery County Forensic Center for autopsy.
