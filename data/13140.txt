A man who Columbia Police say allegedly shot himself in the head during a police chase near Garner's Ferry Road Sunday night has died, the Richland County Coroner's Office announced Monday afternoon.

Donald Ross Rikard, 21, of Columbia , passed away at 4:30 a.m. from complications of the gunshot wound, Coroner Gary Watts said in a release. The incident occurred around 11 p.m. Sunday near an apartment complex off of Pelham Drive.

A Columbia police officer attempted to stop the vehicle the man was driving after he saw it matched the description of a recent armed robbery on Garners Ferry Road, Watts said.



"The man fled and subsequently wrecked his vehicle on Pelham Drive," he said.

Police chased the man on foot near the apartment complex. When the officer ordered him to stop, Watts said, he placed the weapon to his head and fired.
