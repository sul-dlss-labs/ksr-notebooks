Police have identified the man who was killed after he allegedly led officers on a chase and then crashed into two other vehicles in Glenolden, Pennsylvania Monday.

Mark Eric Anderson, 25, of Chester, was spotted by a Folcroft Police officer speeding in a White Nissan on Chester Pike around 4 p.m., according to investigators.

The officer also noticed that the car’s Certificate of Inspection, which was peeled back from the windshield, appeared to be counterfeit, police said.

The officer made a U-Turn and began following the vehicle as it turned left from Chester Pike onto Primos Avenue.

The officer continued to follow the vehicle which was traveling at a normal rate of speed, according to investigators. Anderson then turned left onto Glen Avenue. The officer activated his emergency lights and siren in an attempt to pull Anderson’s vehicle over.

Anderson allegedly continued driving for several blocks and then accelerated as he turned back onto Chester Pike. Anderson then somehow lost control of his car and crashed head-on into a red Pontiac Grand Am in front of the Glenolden Fire Company.

The officer said he lost sight of Anderson prior to the crash due to heavy traffic in the area. Witnesses told NBC10 they spotted police cars speeding after Anderson however.

“They went by me like 100 miles per hour,” said Mark Checkowitz, one of the witnesses. “I heard this loud boom.”

Anderson was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident. A person inside the Grand Am was injured and taken to the Crozer-Chester Medical Center where he or she is in critical condition.

According to officials, there was a warrant out for Anderson’s arrest prior to the pursuit and crash though they have not yet revealed what he was charged with.
