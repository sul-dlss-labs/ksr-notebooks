OWENSBORO, KY (WFIE) - The Daviess County Sheriff's Office has confirmed that a man was shot and killed following a burglary in Daviess County.

We're told deputies were dispatched to the burglary in progress in the 100 block of Booth Field Road around 12:11 p.m.

Daviess County Sheriff Keith Cain says deputies were advised by the 911 caller who discovered the intruder, that the intruder was brandishing a firearm as they left.

Cain says deputies determined the intruder left the area, got a description of him and started searching a wooded area near the house. We're told schools in the area were placed on lock-down during the search.

Cain says 15 minutes into the search, law enforcement found someone who met the description of the intruder about a quarter mile from Fern Creek Terrace, northwest of where the burglary happened. Officers confronted him and told him several times to surrender and the person knelt down to comply with the orders.

Cain says an officer went to go for his taser, but before he could get to it, the person raised a handgun that they had hidden on them in the direction of the officers. In that time, officers fired a rifle and hit the person.

According to Cain, the person died on scene. No officers were injured. Kentucky State Police are taking the lead on the shooting investigation. Sheriff Deputies are investigating the burglary.

Kentucky State Police tell us an autopsy on the suspect will be performed Friday. Police expect to release the suspect and the officer's name after the autopsy.
