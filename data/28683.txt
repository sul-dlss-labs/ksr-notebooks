A 66-year-old man is dead after a wreck that also injured a Metro Nashville Police officer.

Metro Nashville Police have charged 56-year-old Roger McElroy with vehicular homicide and vehicular assault in connection with the three-vehicle crash.

Nashville police responded Wednesday afternoon to Clarksville Highway and Bear Hollow Road, in front of Greenville United Methodist Church.

According to a preliminary investigation, around 3:30 p.m. McElroy ran a stop sign on Bernard Road and entered Clarksville Pike where he was struck by a Ford Fusion driven by Steven Toth, police said.

Toth's vehicle went into the northbound lanes of Clarksville Pike and collided with officer Ben Cantrell's police cruiser.

Toth was taken to Skyline Medical Center where he later died.

Cantrell's arms were injured, and he was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. The officer, a 19-year MNPD veteran assigned to the West Precinct, was heading home after ending his day shift .

Police said McElroy, who reported that he had taken prescription medication and smoked CBD, had bloodshot eyes and constricted pupils.

"He appeared confused and displayed indicators of impairment during the administration of Standard Field Sobriety Tasks," police said in a news release. "A sample of his blood will be analyzed for alcohol and drug content."

McElroy has two previous DUI convictions and was also charged with driving on a revoked license. He is being held in lieu of $173,000 bond.

This is a developing story and will be updated.
