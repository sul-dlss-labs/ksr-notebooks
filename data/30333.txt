Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of a male and the wounding of two others in an incident in which a Harris County Sheriff’s deputy then fatally shot an armed male suspect at 2301 Main Street about 1:15 a.m. today (May 31).

The identities of the deceased victim and suspect are pending verification by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.

The deputy who discharged his duty weapon was not injured in this incident.

HPD Special Investigations Unit Sergeant M. Ynosenciso and Detectives O. Flores, V. Praxedes, T. Vaca and N. Alvarado reported:

For unknown reasons, a shooting occured inside the nightclub at the above address. During the incident, three male patrons were shot. One was pronounced dead at the scene. Two others were transported to area hospitals. One was treated and released with a gunshot wound to the leg. The other suffered multiple gunshot wounds and remains in critical condition.

Harris County Sheriff’s deputies, who were working security at the club, reacted quickly to the situation. One deputy discharged his duty weapon, striking an armed suspect who was pronounced dead at the scene.

At this time, it is unclear if any other patrons fired weapons inside the club. Anyone with information in this case is urged to contact the HPD Special Investigations Unit at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS.

As is customary when a law enforcement officer discharges a weapon in the city limits of Houston, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Special Investigations Unit and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
