A man shot by a Phoenix police officer along the Arizona Canal in Phoenix on Friday was identified as Dustin Selby, 31, authorities said.

Selby was suspected of shoplifting items at a business near 12th Street and Northern Avenue about 11 a.m., said Phoenix police Sgt. Mercedes Fortune. A man showed a knife to a store employee, threatened the employee and fled, police said.

Officers caught up to a man meeting the shoplifter's description near a bike path along the canal, only a few blocks away.

Selby was wielding an 8-inch knife when officers arrived and refused to follow commands, Fortune said. Then the man picked up a blanket and wrapped himself in it, revealing a second knife to the officers, according to Fortune.

Selby began walking toward one of the officers, a 30-year-old man with more than eight years on the force, who then used a stun gun on Selby, Fortune said. The stun gun was ineffective, and Selby continued to advance; the officer found himself up against a canal gate and, feeling threatened, opened fire, according to Fortune.

A second officer was present at the time of the shooting, a 52-year-old woman with more than 22 years on the force, according to Fortune.

The officers' identities were not released.

Phoenix fire units were sent to the scene, where the man was pronounced dead.
