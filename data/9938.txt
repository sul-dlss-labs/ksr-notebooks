Kansas Highway Patrol officials Wednesday said DNA results have confirmed the identity of a motorist who was killed after a police chase ended in a fiery crash March 8 in central Kansas.

The patrol identified the fatality victim as Christopher Michael Bruns, of Golden, Colo.

According to Trooper J.L. Riedel, Bruns was behind the wheel of a pickup truck traveling west on Interstate 70 late on March 8.

When a trooper attempted to stop the truck near the Saline-Lincoln county line for a traffic violation, the suspect’s vehicle refused to stop, and a chase ensued.

The motorist being pursued and trooper continued to travel westbound on I-70 with the suspect driving around several sets of spike strips and, at times, driving in the opposite lane of traffic.

As the suspect approached Russell, law enforcement officers had spike strips set across both eastbound and westbound lanes of I-70, Riedel said.

When the motorist approached the area in which the spike strips were deployed, his vehicle drove head-on into a semitrailer that was eastbound on I-70.

The truck’s driver died in the crash. The driver of the semi wasn't injured.

Because of the seriousness of the crash and the fact that fire was involved, positive identification of the suspect driver couldn’t be made through normal identification processes, Riedel said.
