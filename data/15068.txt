Allen returned to his red 2013 Chevy and tried to drive away as DeWilde and the ICE agent approached. Police say Allen struck DeWilde, who was thrown onto the Chevy's hood.

While on the hood, DeWilde shot Allen in the chest. DeWilde was thrown from the vehicle, and Allen crashed the Chevy nearby.

Allen faces a charge of aggravated assault on a public servant. He remains hospitalized in critical condition.

Records show that Allen has been arrested numerous times in Harris County. The arrests include drug charges, an evading arrest with a motor vehicle and several property crime charges.

His mother said Allen just moved to Dallas about a week ago to start a job.

She said she doesn't believe Allen would try to hurt anyone, but possibly got scared when he saw the officers.

DeWilde, who joined the department in 2008, was taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital with a broken bone in a "lower extremity." He was treated for the fracture and other bumps and bruises and has been released.
