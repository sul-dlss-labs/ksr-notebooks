GRAND JUNCTION â€” Two Grand Junction police officers who shot and killed a man in a motel last month have been cleared of wrongdoing.

A Mesa County investigation has cleared Allen Kwiatkowski and Isaac Gallegos in the Feb. 28 death. The officers were looking for 39-year-old Brent Ingram in a room at the Timbers Motel when Ingram emerged from a bathroom holding a knife.

The officers said Ingram held the knife over his head and started running toward one of the officers. Officers fired four shots, hitting Ingram twice in the chest and killing him.

An autopsy concluded Ingram was drunk at the time of his death and had recently used cocaine.
