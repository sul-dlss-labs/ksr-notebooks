Monticello â€” Sullivan County's biggest town and village are now primed to handle a disaster.

That's a big change from a year ago, when the Town of Thompson and Village of Monticello were simply relying on the county to oversee disaster response.

Now, they've created a joint emergency management plan, a comprehensive document that includes a local chain of command, a list of shelters and a database of potential hazards.

The Town Board approved the plan this month, and village trustees likely will vote on it in January.

Last year, the two municipalities were among 41 Catskill and Hudson Valley communities deemed "unprepared" in a review of local disaster plans by the Sunday Record.

At least half of the 41, including Thompson and Monticello, now have changed their ways, forming disaster committees, updating plans, or both.

"This definitely had to be updated. This definitely had to be done," says Monticello Trustee Victor Marinello, who sat on the committee that created the document. "When we (started) this plan, there was no point of contact in the village."

About half of Sullivan County's 15 towns now have such plans, says Dick Martinkovic, the county's public safety commissioner. That's at the county's urging.

"Locals need to take charge of their area for the first 72 hours," says Martinkovic. "They're in better position to respond to needs of their residents."

This winter, Martinkovic worries that the Northeast is due for an ice storm, knocking out utilities and making driving near impossible.

"It could happen at any time with the lack of snow and the rain," he says. "It's very critical that each of the towns and the villages, and especially the county, be up to snuff."

The Emergency Management Committee seeks volunteers to receive training in how to run a shelter. Anyone interested should call Peppy Satenstein at 791-8332.
