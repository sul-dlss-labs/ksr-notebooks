BRISBANE â€” A motorist was killed in Brisbane on Sunday morning when their car went over an embankment during a short police chase.

The victim, who has not been identified, was driving on Geneva Avenue near Bayshore Boulevard in Daly City when an officer tried to pull the car over, Daly City police Sgt. Harold Rolfes said. The driver did not stop, and continued down Bayshore at about 40 mph.

Police pursued the car for a short time before it veered off the road at Bayshore and Industrial Road in Brisbane, Rolfes said. The car went down an embankment and came to a rest after hitting several trees and a building.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene, Rolfes said. No one else was in the car.

Authorities are investigating the cause of the crash, and why the driver failed to stop. The crash is being jointly investigated by Daly City police and the California Highway Patrol.
