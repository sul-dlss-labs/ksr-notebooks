A man died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound Friday after police approached him in order to serve a felony warrant, the Lancaster County district attorney's office said.

Patrick G. Sensenig, 27, reportedly died from a gunshot wound to the head in a small mobile home community, located at 3137 Main Street in Conestoga.

Southern Regional police approached a mobile home just before the 7 a.m. hour Friday, district attorney spokesperson Brett Hambright said.

Although it was not Sensenig's home, police knew he had a tendency to be there, Hambright said.

He had a felony warrant stemming from last week and the same officer who charged him had gone to the mobile home to arrest him, Hambright said. Details of the charges weren't immediately available.

The unnamed officer was invited inside the home where Sensenig and a woman engaged in a cordial conversation. The officer made it clear to the man that he would have to go with him, Hambright said.

The man then went into another room to retrieve his shoes when a single gun shot was heard, Hambright said.

Police did not shoot, Hambright said, and the woman at the home is not charged.

When asked if the officer faces any disciplinary action for letting Sensenig go unsupervised into another room, Hambright replied that he wasn't aware of any.

The officer was a few feet from Sensenig the entire time, due to the small space of the trailer, he added.

"There was a rapport between police and (the) man so the officer used his discretion based on that," Hambright said. "The police did not in any way anticipate or provoke this and are certainly not to blame for the unfortunate loss of life."
