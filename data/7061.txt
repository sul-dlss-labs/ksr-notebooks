Fernando Cortez, 21, a Latino man, was killed in a deputy-involved shooting in the 1500 block of East 92nd Street in Florence about 5:55 p.m. Saturday, April 12.

According to Deputy Oscar Butao of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, gang enforcement deputies from the sheriff's Century station were at a stop light across from the Ranchito Market when they were approached by someone who said that a man inside the store was armed with a gun.

The deputies later detained Cortez and were searching him when he allegedly pulled a handgun out of his pocket. Butao said the deputies reported that they feared for their lives and fired several shots at Cortez. He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics at 6:05 p.m.
