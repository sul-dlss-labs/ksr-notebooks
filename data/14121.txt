Craig Yarbrough, 20, is charged with reckless manslaughter following a crash in Tarrant on Feb. 28, 2014.

TARRANT, Alabama - A 20-year-old Birmingham man has been charged in the death of his passenger after a crash last week in Tarrant.

Craig Yarbrough is charged with reckless manslaughter in the Feb. 28 death of 18-year-old Natasha Renee Osby. Tarrant Police Chief Dennis Reno said Yarbrough was fleeing from police shortly before the crash.

Police tried to stop Yarbrough on a traffic violation, but he fled. Officers followed a short distance but lost sight of him and called off the chase.

Yarbrough later lost control in a curve and struck two trees. The accident happened in the 1300 block of Spring Street.

Osby was taken to UAB Hospital where she was pronounced dead later that day. Yarbrough was hospitalized with two broken legs. On Monday, he was released from the hospital and booked into the Jefferson County Jail with bond set at $100,000.

Reno said Yarbrough had several outstanding warrants from Adamsville, and was speeding when the crash happened.
