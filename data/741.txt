Brian Pannebaker, 31, died at Kremmling Memorial Hospital a short time later.

Authorities said two Kremmling police officers and State Trooper Jack Desanti, sent to check on Pannebaker's welfare, found him in a pickup truck outside his residence, with the engine running and a hose attached to the tailpipe.

When the officers approached, Pannebaker produced a knife, smashed the passenger window and climbed out. While brandishing the knife, Pannebaker approached one of the police officers, said District Attorney Paul McLimans.

Pannebaker then came at Desanti, McLimans said.

The trooper backed away for some distance, then fired two rounds from his service weapon as Pannebaker advanced on him with the knife raised, McLimans said.

Both shots hit Pannebaker, authorities said.

Desanti, a nine-year veteran, was placed on administrative leave with pay, which is standard procedure, pending an investigation into the shooting, said State Patrol spokesman Rod Campbell.

The results of the investigation will be turned over to the district attorney's office for a decision, but the preliminary investigation turned up "nothing out of order," said Lt. Walt Eldridge of the Grand County Sheriff's Office.

"It looks like it was strictly self-defense on the officer's part," he said.

Pannebaker had pleaded guilty earlier this week to misdemeanor charges of menacing and the prohibited use of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with a Dec. 26 incident that authorities said started as a domestic violence harassment case. Police seized a .22-caliber rifle in connection with the incident.

Pannebaker was given a deferred judgment and a three-day jail sentence. He was to report Monday to the Grand County Jail to serve his time.

Authorities said Pannebaker and his wife had recently separated and he lost his job last week after his employer went bankrupt.
