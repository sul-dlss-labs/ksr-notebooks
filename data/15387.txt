on Wednesday. Investigators say Crowder died while trying to save her 12-year-old son.

According to a police report, Crowder's son said the legally married couple argued for hours before Grant pulled out two handguns, laid them on the table and said, "We're gonna settle this now." The boy's mother hit Grant in the head with a gun and told him to run away. He said he heard several shots before Grant fired a shot at him.

Crowder was shot three times. She died at Regional Medical Center.

Investigators believe she was shot with Grant's MPD-issued service weapon.

"I don't think being a police officer exempts you from any of the other pressures of life," said Memphis Police Director Toney Armstrong.

Grant told investigators the shooting was in self-defense; her attorney says she is not guilty. Police reports indicate that her story does not match what witnesses say happened. She was relieved of duty pending the outcome of the investigation.

In court, Grant was ordered not to have any contact with her stepson. Her next court appearance is scheduled for Dec. 18.

Grant and Crowder had been married for a couple of months.
