GOODMAN - The Wisconsin Department of Justice on Thursday identified the man fatally shot by Marinette County sheriff's deputies last week, the man he is accused of killing and the officers involved in the shooting.

Deputies responded around 5 p.m. Friday to a home in Goodman for a report of a possible homicide, according to a news release from the state DOJ. Inside the home, deputies found the body of Richard Gibbs, 62, of Milwaukee.

As police arrived, a man — identified as John Lipski, 62, of Milwaukee — drove away from the home. Deputies followed him, Lipski stopped his vehicle, got out of the car and pointed a firearm at deputies, according to the DOJ. Deputies shot Lipski and he died at the scene.
