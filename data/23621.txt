SHERWOOD, Ore. -- Deputies on Thursday released more details about an officer-involved shooting during a tactical situation that occurred just north of Sherwood on Jan. 12.

Sabbe was first reported to dispatch for acting erratically while driving in an open field in the area of Southwest Scholls-Sherwood Road and Roy Rogers Road . Sabbe has a family connection to the property but that hasn't been fully investigated, according to the Washington County Sheriff's Office.

Witnesses reported hearing shots fired in the area prior to authorities showing up. Just after 1:30 p.m., a Sherwood police officer arrived and Sabbe drove away and crashed his pickup truck into a tree. The officer said he heard gunshots and saw Sabbe carrying a rifle, the sheriff's office said.

A tactical team was then called, and they set up a perimeter and closed nearby roads. They tried to call Sabbe but he didn't answer his phone, deputies said.

Just after 3:30 p.m., a WCSO armored vehicle engaged Sabbe's pickup truck and a chase ensued in the open field. The two vehicles collided several times.

At one point, Sabbe started to exit his vehicle with an AR-15 rifle still in his lap, the sheriff's office said. From inside the truck, Sabbe pointed the rifle at tactical officers and that's when they fired numerous shots at Sabbe, killing him, according to deputies. They found a loaded AR-15 rifle inside his truck.
