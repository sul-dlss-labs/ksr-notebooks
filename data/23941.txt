The suspect has been identified as Rueben T. Ruffin Jr, 24, of Frankfort, KY.

Trooper Blake Owens, 27, of Owensboro, was the trooper who responded to the call and confronted Ruffin. Trooper Owens has been with Kentucky State Police for about 2.5 years. Owens has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The Medical Examiner’s Office stated Ruffin died of two gunshot wounds which appear consistent with the rifle used by Trooper Owens. Officials say the handgun used by Ruffin was stolen.

The Daviess County Sheriff’s Department called KSP around 4:30 p.m. Monday because a black Jeep Grand Cherokee was doing donuts out in muddy farm fields near the 300 block of Hill Bridge Road. The deputies and troopers located the unoccupied Jeep at a house on Hill Bridge Road and discovered it was reported stolen from Lexington, KY.

As responding units approached the residence to investigate, the suspect ran out the back door of the house, got inside the Jeep and drove off, doing donuts in the yard, throwing mud and debris on a sheriff’s deputy. The suspect then drove through muddy farm fields until he crashed in a ditch a mile away and took off running.

When a trooper caught up with the driver, he had a pistol in his hand. When the trooper told him to drop the gun, the suspect continued walking toward him. As the suspect pointed his pistol at the trooper, the trooper fired his rifle, hitting the suspect.

The trooper and responding deputies began conducting life-saving measures, as medics were dispatched to the scene. Law enforcement gave the ambulance an escort to Owensboro Health, but the suspect died shortly after. At the time of this report, his identity was unknown. An autopsy was scheduled for 9:00 a.m. Tuesday in Madisonville.

The trooper involved was not hurt and has been placed on paid administrative leave. The sheriff deputies also report no injuries.
