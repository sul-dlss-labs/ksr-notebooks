A routine traffic stop leads to one man drowning in Lake Charles.

It happened Monday night near Harrah's Casino and the Southwest Louisiana Convention and Visitors Bureau.

State Police say they pulled over 22-year old Fabian Hurts for following too close. Troopers called in a K-9 unit after a brief search lead to suspicion of drugs. They found 15 pounds of marijuana, and that's when Hurts fled on foot. Troopers say Hurts ran across Interstate 10 and into the lake.

The Calcasieu Parish marine unit found Hurts' body shortly before 10 p.m..
