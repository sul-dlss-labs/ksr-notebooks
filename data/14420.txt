At least three people were injured after an SUV tried to outrun the California Highway Patrol, lost control and crashed into a pedestrian and two vehicles in Inglewood Tuesday.

The four-minute chase began around 6:30 p.m. on the 105 Freeway and continued onto Century Boulevard near LAX.

CHP chased the Chevy Tahoe with lights and sirens because it was "following too close."

The SUV was trying to outrun CHP and after hitting a car, hit a pedestrian crossing the street. That pedestrian came flying towards another car and as a result was hit again, according to Marco Pinto, the driver of the car that accidentally hit the pedestrian.

The SUV overturned.

The driver of the SUV fled the scene but was in custody a short time later. As many as three others fled, according to California Highway Patrol Officer Peter Bishop.

The pedestrian was hospitalized in critical condition.

The driver of the SUV and one of the cars hit were also taken to the hospital.

Century Boulevard between Freeman and Myrtle was closed until 3:30 a.m. Wednesday.
