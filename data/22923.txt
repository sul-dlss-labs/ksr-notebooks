WASHINGTON — A man wounded during an exchange of gunfire with authorities in Old Town Warrenton earlier this month has died of his injuries.

Fauquier County Sheriff’s deputies were concerned about the mental health of Joshua Michael Simpson, 34, when they went to his home on Alexandria Pike. Deputies attempted to serve an emergency custody order around 2 p.m. on Oct. 6.

A subsequent standoff through the night led to robo calls warning residents to stay inside their homes. Some Old Town roads were also closed, and authorities shot multiple rounds of tear gas into Simpson’s home.

Authorities say Simpson was shot in the 17th hour of the standoff after he ran out of his home and fired a shotgun at officials gathered outside.

A large police presence during the incident included an armored vehicle, heavily suited sheriff’s deputies, Warrenton police and Virginia state troopers.

Simpson died of his injuries shortly after 4 p.m. on Oct. 10 at INOVA Fairfax Hospital.

The Fauquier County Commonwealth’s Attorney’s Office will determine whether Simpson’s shooting was justified upon the completion of an investigation, which will be handled by the Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation’s Police Shooting Investigative Team and the Fauquier County Sheriff’s Office.

The investigation is expected to take a couple of months.
