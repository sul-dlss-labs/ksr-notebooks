SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - The uncle of the man killed in an officer involved shooting in Shreveport Wednesday night says that his nephew was not a bad person.

31 year old Elijah Haggerty was shot and killed by police Wednesday night after allegedly shooting 28 year old Jolette Frazier. Police say when they arrived to the home in the 9200 block of Cade Drive, Frazier was outside of the home suffering from a gunshot wound to the torso and Haggerty was inside of the home. Police shot Haggerty after encountering him with a shotgun inside of the house.

Haggerty's Uncle, Garry Paul, says he was turning his life around and wanted to be a preacher. "He was a good kid, he preached his first sermon January 29th," says Paul.

Paul tells News 12 that Haggerty had been in jail before, but was not a violent person. He believes that his nephew was killed unnecessarily.

"He shouldn't have been shot down like a dog. He got shot right here. This is where my nephew got shot at," says Paul pointing to the middle of his forehead.

Haggerty and Frazier have a son together says Paul, and he doesn't know what would lead to this incident.

Police are still investigating both shootings, and Frazier was last reported in critical condition at LSU Health.
