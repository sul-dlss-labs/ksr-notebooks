MUSCLE SHOALS, AL (WAFF) - Muscle Shoals police are struggling with the aftermath of a shooting that left a man dead Sunday afternoon.

The shooting happened just after 3 p.m. Sunday, on 2nd Street in Muscle Shoals, near the TVA Reservation.

According to police at a Monday briefing, officers got a call about a man with a gun at that location. Muscle Shoals Police Chief Robert Evans said officers found Eric Edgell's car nearby when they responded. Evans said they then encountered the Tuscumbia man.

Evans said at least one officer spoke with Edgell, but he was not sure how long the conversation lasted.

He said Edgell became agitated and began to fire a handgun.

Officers returned fire and hit Edgell. Edgell was transported to the hospital, where he later died.

Muscle Shoals police would not make an official comment on the job status of the officers who responded to the scene, however they described the tone at the department Monday as "upset, full of raw emotions."

"They were scared, they were upset, and all the emotions that you think a normal human being would exhibit under those circumstance - they were there," Evans said.

Counseling is being offered for the officers.

An autopsy is underway. ALEA's State Bureau of Investigation is looking into the incident.

Evans would not make an official comment on the job status of the officers who responded to the scene.

"This is a very dangerous profession," Evans said. "We all know that each day that we leave, we may not come home, and each day that we do come home, we're very thankful for that. With that being said, I would ask for - like I've done in the past - ask for prayers for Mr. Edgell's family. I would also ask for prayers for the officers that are involved, for their families and for them."

Police units from Sheffield and the Colbert County Sheriff's Department were assisting Muscle Shoals police at the scene Sunday.
