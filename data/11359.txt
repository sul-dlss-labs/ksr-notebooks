Officials have identified the man shot when law enforcement officers responded to a violent outburst at an Oceanside convenience store.

Elwood Edwards, 22, was shot in the chest and killed around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at Oceanside Boulevard and Temple Heights Dr., near Temple Heights Elementary School.

Officers were called after Edwards allegedly struck one customer over the head with a glass bottle at the AM-PM store on Melrose Drive.

He also allegedly threw a brick through the window of an occupied car, striking a passenger, according to a statement from the Oceanside Police Department.

Witness Reen Bigbey described the suspect jumping on cars and stomping on hoods.

When Edwards ran from the store to the 4900-block of Oceanside Blvd., officers and San Diego County sheriff's deputies made contact with him.

"The male suspect reached into the bed of a truck that was parked. He retrieved what we believe to be a stick, possibly a broom handle," Lt. Joe Young with Oceanside police told NBCSanDiego Sunday.

The suspect was shot once in the chest by a sheriff's deputy Young said.

On Monday, Lt. Leonard Mata told our media partners the North County Times the deputy who fired the fatal shot was Michael Astorga.

Officers performed CPR in an attempt to save the suspect's life.

No officers or deputies were injured in the confrontation, police said.
