HUMBOLDT PARK â€” An autopsy determined Friday that a 21-year-old man died of multiple wounds after Chicago police shot him when he threatened officers with a knife, authorities said.

Raul Barriera was wounded in the cheek and neck Wednesday after police responded to his family's home in the 1600 block of North Tripp Avenue in the Humboldt Park neighborhood, Chicago police spokeswoman Monique Bond said.

A police roundtable discussion determined the shooting was legally justified, according to Bond.

Justina Barriera, 80, Raul's grandmother, said he suffered from schizophrenia, but she described him as gentle and helpful when he was taking his medication. On Wednesday evening, the family called the police because he was out of control and they wanted to get him to a hospital, she said.

Police spokesman Pat Camden said the man was armed with a knife and refused orders from police to drop the weapon.
