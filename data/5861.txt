Incident at 5214 Wickview January 29, 2007 -- A suspect who fired a shot at her boyfriend and threatened to commit suicide was found dead at 5214 Wickview about 10:30 p.m. on Sunday (Jan. 28). The deceased suspect is identified as Francine Sonnier (b/f, DOB 5-17-72). Ms. Sonnier was pronounced dead at the scene of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant J.H. Roberts and Officer A.J. Palos reported: Patrol officers were dispatched to the residence at 5214 Wickview about 7:30 p.m. for a disturbance call involving a female. The caller reported that a female took a shot at her boyfriend. Officers arrived and observed a female at the front door of the residence. As officers approached, the female suspect retreated into a bedroom of the residence. Officers were granted access to the residence by other residents and asked the suspect several times to come out and she stated that she would in a few minutes. Officers continued to attempt to communicate with the suspect through the door and heard a muffled sound come from the bedroom. Unable to get a response from the suspect, officers removed all occupants from the residence, retreated and called SWAT units to the location. After attempting to contact the barricaded suspect for several hours, SWAT officers made entry into the bedroom and found the female dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. The suspect left a suicide note inside of the residence. The boyfriend was not injured and police fired no shots. As is customary with an in-custody death, the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney's office are investigating the incident. NJM/JFC 1-29-07
