ATWATER, California (KSEE) — Authorities say Timothy Breckenridge, 42, is the man who was killed by law enforcement in Atwater last Friday.

Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke says his deputies, and officers from the county’s probation department went to the house on Atwater Boulevard for a compliance check.

When they entered the home the person they were looking for was not there, instead, Warnke says Breckenridge was inside the home armed with a pellet gun that appeared to be a real handgun.

“We don’t have the time nor the pleasure to make sure that the persons involved are carrying a bb gun or airsoft,” says Warnke.

Warnke says after several attempts to get Breckenridge to comply, he made a move that cost him his life.

“They were in this house literally screaming at the guy to drop the gun,” says Warnke. “He had made enough of a movement to warrant justified actions on our part to shoot him.”

The sheriff says two deputies and a probation officer opened fire.

“This is our department’s first ever officer-involved shooting,” says Jeff Kettering, chief of the Merced County Probation Department.

The sheriff says there is body camera video, but it will not be released any time soon because it’s still considered evidence.

“I have viewed the video on this, and our guys–on that particular day–did everything right,” says Warnke.

The sheriff says it is still unknown how many bullets struck Breckenridge, but an autopsy on him should be complete by the end of the day on Monday.
