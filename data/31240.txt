PUEBLO, Colo. (KKTV) - A confrontation over a code enforcement issue ended with one person dead at a east Pueblo home.

Initially, police told 11 News an officer was in stable condition following the incident, but a police spokesperson has since updated that no officers were hurt.

The episode started around 9 a.m. when code enforcement went to do an abatement at a home in the area of 19th and Monument.

“One of the resident threatened the code enforcement with a firearm. Police were called. Police arrived on scene; they aired that there were shots fired. We do have one person deceased on scene,” said Sgt. Frank Ortega with the Pueblo Police Department.

Police are still trying to sort out exactly what transpired but do confirm officers fired their guns. Ortega says there were multiple people inside the home when the shooting occurred.

After the shooting, the situation developed into a multi-hour standoff.

Police and SWAT officers set up a perimeter around the home and waited for a search warrant to give them clearance to search the rest of the home and make sure the scene was safe for investigators.

Two family members of the resident who died exited the home peacefully around noon.

A few hours later SWAT cleared the home and allowed investigators to begin their investigation of the shooting.

That investigation should bring light as to what exactly prompted the involved officer to fire. That officer has been placed on routine leave.

It is unclear as of this moment whether or not the officer who fired was using a body camera during the incident.
