Kentucky State Police say troopers responded to a call from the Bell County Sheriff’s Office over the weekend. A Bell County deputy was responding to an unrelated call when he found 57-year-old Gary Partin of Frakes acting suspiciously while driving an ATV. The deputy attempted to make a traffic stop and Partin failed to stop leading him on a short pursuit. The ATV crashed into a ditch and the deputy said Partin stood up on the ATV and pulled a gun out of his waistband. Investigators say the deputy fired upon Partin fatally striking him. The Bell County Deputy Coroner responded and pronounced him dead at the scene. The body will be sent to the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Frankfort for an autopsy. The case remains under investigation by KSP.
