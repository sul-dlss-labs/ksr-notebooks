SEDONA, AZ — Authorities are investigating after a Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office deputy fatally shot a woman in Sedona Saturday evening.

Deputies say at around 6:50 p.m. they responded to a domestic disturbance call in the area of 55 Cathedral Rock Drive in the Village of Oak Creek. The female subject involved in the domestic disturbance allegedly discharged a firearm.

When deputies arrived, the woman, later identified as 56-year-old Wendy Jones, confronted them outside, armed with a handgun.

Authorities say Jones then brandished the firearm after "multiple attempts at de-escalation and negotiations as well as numerous verbal commands to drop the weapon."

A patrol sergeant fired a single shot at Jones in response to the threat authorities say she caused to the responding deputies. Jones was pronounced deceased at the scene, officials say.

Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office says the patrol sergeant is a 16-year veteran at YCSO.

No deputies were injured during the incident.

Arizona Department of Public Safety will be conducting the investigation.
