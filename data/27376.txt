HONOLULU — Officials in Honolulu say the second set of human remains found inside a burnt-out home near Waikiki where two police officers were shot and killed last month belong to the suspected killer.

The mayor’s office released a statement Wednesday saying the remains of 69-year-old Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel had been positively identified.

Police say Hanel shot two officers after he attacked and stabbed a neighbor who called 911 for help.

The remains of Hanel’s landlord, Lois Cain, were also found inside the home. Hanel is also believed to have killed Cain. She was attempting to evict Hanel at the time of the violence.

Shortly after the police officers were shot, the home caught fire. The blaze spread to and destroyed several other homes in the neighborhood.

After days of sifting through the debris, officials said two bodies had been found. They immediately identified Cain but did not release Hanel’s name, pending notification of next of kin.

Hawaii lawmakers on Tuesday unveiled several measures to prevent gun violence and boost mental health care.

Neighbors, police and Hanel’s former attorney have said he was suffering from mental illness.
