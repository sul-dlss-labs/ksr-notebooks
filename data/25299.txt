This happened just hours after the carjacking victim was robbed at gunpoint in Daytona Beach.

The driver was 20 years old and his passenger was 17 years old.

Their lives ended when the car went out of control and slammed into a tree where the bark is missing at the bottom from the crash.

A stolen car fleeing from law enforcement hit stop sticks in Port Orange and the driver lost control and crashed.

The aftermath left a mangled mess with two people dead inside: 17-year-old Diaquiri Chambers and the 20-year-old driver Dominique Saint-Vil.

Chambers great-great grandmother said the 17-year-old Mainland High School student had just been to the baby shower for a child his girlfriend was about to have when he left with friends.

The car he was in at the time of the crash had been involved in a carjacking in Daytona Beach earlier in the evening.

The victim said he was there to meet someone on business when men with guns jumped him and stole his car.

Saint-Vil's family said he wasn't the carjacker.

Whatever happened, it has left the victim shaken and two families heartbroken.

The two who died were listed as suspects in several stolen car complaints and car break-ins.

There is no word yet on any other suspects in the carjacking.
