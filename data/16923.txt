Investigators said what started out as domestic dispute call, ended with one man dead Friday afternoon.

It happened at a home on Mount Vernon Baptist Church Road in unincorporated Paulding County near Dallas.

The Paulding County Sheriff's Office said four deputies responded to a home where they were met by 39-year-old William Tarrant. Investigators told FOX 5 the deputies determined DFACS and the Crimes Against Children Unit needed to be called in.

For hours, the deputies were engaged in conversations with Tarrant. Around 3:15 p.m., the sheriff's office said Tarrant was told his infant child was going to be removed.

Investigators said that is when Tarrant pulled a handgun from the small of his back. The sheriff's office said three deputies fired at Tarrant, striking and killing him.

Several members of the church next door, Vernon Baptist Church, said Tarrant's family belongs to the congregation.

One woman described the family as "good, kind-hearted people." She also said she did not know Tarrant personally.

The Sheriff's Office said they had responded to calls involving Tarrant previously.

The GBI has been called in to conduct an independent investigation. The three deputies involved have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for a deputy-involved shooting.
