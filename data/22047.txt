Police Chief Greg Stevens said Monday that his officers did nothing wrong on September 21 in the 1800 block of 66th Street when officers arrested Adrien Campbell, 24.

The Lubbock County Medical Examiner released a statement Monday that said, “The Manner of Death is classified as Homicide.”

Stevens held a news conference to explain what led up to Campbell’s death.

Lubbock Police said a detective witnessed Campbell hit a woman and took action to arrest him. But instead, Campbell ran off.

“After he lost sight of him, other officers had began to get in to the area,” said Chief Stevens. “A canine officer was there to assist as well. They used the canine to find Mr. Campbell hiding behind a porch.”

After a chase, officers eventually located Campbell and noticed that he was not in good health. Officers called for EMS and Campbell was taken to University Medical Center instead of jail.

“So, early on they could tell he was in some kind of distress,” said Chief Stevens.

He died the following day at the hospital, after being released from LPD custody.

The medical examiner said the specific cause of death was physiological derailment because of a physical struggle and the use of methamphetamine.

Police indicated there was no excessive use of force. Stevens said all officers followed proper procedure and nothing could have been done differently.

“They met the public’s expectation and they met my expectations,” said Chief Stevens.

Campbell had previous convictions for burglary of a habitation in Bexar County and evading arrest in Ector County.

The medical examiner released the following statement:
