A 52-year-old man who died after being taken into police custody in downtown Portland on Thanksgiving succumbed to methamphetamine and cocaine in his system, Multnomah County announced Monday.

The county medical examiner’s office ruled Richard A. Barry’s death was accidental and that it occurred due to acute methamphetamine and cocaine toxicity. The county hasn’t said how much of the drugs were found in Barry’s system or when he may have ingested them.

The ruling means authorities determined Barry didn’t intend to kill himself by taking the drugs. Drowning while swimming in a pool, for example, would also be designated as an accidental death by the medical examiner’s office.

The county declined to release Barry’s full medical report, saying “this death was not related to officer involvement.”

Portland State University campus police officer David Troppe and public safety officers Michael Anderson, Danae Murphy and Nichola Higbee responded to calls about Barry yelling and running through the streets near Southwest Sixth Avenue and Mill Street around 8:20 p.m. on Nov. 22, according to the university. Barry got into a scuffle with the officers, injuring one of them.

Someone from the group of four called for backup and Portland police officers James DeAnda and Jared Abby then joined the fray, the university said. Barry was restrained afterward.

Portland police called for an ambulance because of Barry’s behavior and an apparent medical condition, the Police Bureau said. He died after arriving at a hospital, according to police. The police bureau hasn’t released any details or description of Barry’s apparent medical condition before the ambulance arrived.

All six officers were temporarily placed on paid administrative leave, a standard practice, amid an investigation of Barry’s death.
