During the chase, officers said the fleeing vehicle struck a pedestrian near South 21st Street and West National Avenue in Milwaukee. Officers then called off the chase. "I heard the tires screeching and all the cops coming and that horrible sounding thud. I was like 'Oh God, someone got hit,'" said Kevin Skenandore, who lives nearby. The family told WISN 12 the person struck and killed was Calob House. He is a Milwaukee native and father of four. "There will forever be a blank sheet or a void in their life, right. Off of what? Off a traffic violation?" said the victim's brother, Michael House. West Allis police said the driver did not stop and no arrests have been made."For somebody to just hit another person like an animal on the street and just keep going with no empathy for the other person. I mean, it just blows my mind," said House's father, Kevin House. "This is not how I planned to wake up today. I don't even know what to think."Police said the suspect vehicle is a 2002 to 2006 Nissan Altima, four-door, tan in color, unknown plates with tinted windows.
