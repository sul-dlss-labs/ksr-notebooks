HOLLY, MI â€“ A carjacking suspected is dead after a standoff with police in Holly.

The Michigan State Police say a bomb squad robot was sent into the home on East Maple Street on Tuesday night after the suspect failed to respond to police. Once inside it located the male suspect dead from a gunshot wound, police said.

The ordeal began when a tipster reported seeing the male and a female accomplice with a stolen minivan at a rest area off northbound I-75 near Holly Road.

Troopers attempted a traffic stop, but the suspects fled, eventually traveling at a high rate of speed onto Holly Road. Troopers then lost sight of the van.

As the troopers continued driving on Holly Road, they observed a vehicle with crash damage along the side of the road and further up the road was a second crashed vehicle and the stolen minivan in the front yard of a home.

The drivers of the two other vehicles had non-life-threatening injuries and were transported out of the area. The suspects were observed by troopers running into an occupied home where homeowners were released unharmed, police said.

A lengthy standoff then began with troopers attempting to negotiate with the suspects.

The female suspect eventually surrendered and was arrested, but the male suspect fired at officers on scene and remained in the house, according to police.

Residents in the area were told to remain in their homes during the standoff, which ended once the robot entered the home and confirmed the suspect was dead.

The MSP Third District Incident Response Team is investigating the incident. East Maple Road will be closed while the investigation continues.
