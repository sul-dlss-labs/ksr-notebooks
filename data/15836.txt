WALNUT PARK – A foot chase of a suspect in unincorporated Walnut Park ended with his death in a deputy-involved shooting, authorities said today.

The suspect and a female passenger had been sought for avoiding a traffic stop when they crashed their stolen vehicle in an alley and fled the scene, said Los Angeles County sheriff’s Deputy Trina Schrader said.

Both suspects fled through yards in the neighborhood before the suspect was contacted in the 2400 block of Flower Street around 6:40 p.m. Thursday, Schrader said.

The shooting occurred when the suspect placed his hands in his waistband, Schrader said.

Witnesses to the crash had told deputies the suspect was armed, but Schrader said no weapon was found.

The suspect broke into two occupied residences and stole property as deputies searched for him, Schrader said.

The female passenger in the vehicle was taken into custody, Schrader said.
