District Attorney: Officers "lawfully used deadly force" in shooting that left Maxwell Holt dead

MILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- A ruling from the Milwaukee County DA about a deadly officer-involved shooting 5 months ago was released today.

John Chisholm announced that five police officers, three from West Allis and two from New Berlin, "lawfully used deadly force" in a shooting that left 37-year-old Maxwell Holt dead.

West Allis police officers responded to an armed robbery at a George Webb's restaurant back in May. A witness told police that the suspect exited the restaurant and fled in a white sedan. Officers attempted a traffic stop. That's when police say that Holt exited the vehicle, pointed a firearm at an officer and fired three shots. The squad car was struck by gunfire.

Holt fled the scene. With the assistance of New Berlin police, Holt was located in a dumpster in a nearby parking lot. Holt allegedly held a black pistol in his hand and pointed it towards the officers.

Officers, fearing for their safety, fired a total of 67 rounds. Holt was pronounced dead at the scene.
