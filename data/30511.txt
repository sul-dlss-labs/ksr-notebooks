TEXARKANA Ark. -- A man is dead after a Texarkana Arkansas Police Department officer shot him Saturday during a possible disturbance call on Hickory Street.

Don Crowson, 37, was pronounced dead at the scene by the Miller County coroner and his body is being sent to the Arkansas State Crime Lab for determination of cause and manner of death, according to a post on the TAPD Facebook page.

The call came in about 9:44 p.m. and officers were dispatched to the 1100 block of Hickory Street.

"The caller told the dispatcher an individual had been pacing in the street yelling that he was going to kill someone and was jumping up and down on a fence," Cpl. Kelly Pilgreen wrote in a press release.

"The caller indicated the man appeared to be under the influence of drugs. Officers arrived on the scene and contacted the individual inside an apartment in a multi family residence in the 1000 block of Hickory," Pilgreen wrote.

"Upon making contact, the male charged the officers with an object yelling that he was going to kill them. One officer on scene fired his service weapon and struck the male. Officers rendered aid until Life-net arrived on the scene. The individual was pronounced deceased at the scene. The officers involved were not injured."

The Arkansas State Police were notified and are currently investigating the incident.

The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the ASP investigation and ruling from the Eighth South Prosecuting Attorney.

Officers' encounter with Crowson was recorded by body-worn cameras in use at the time of the incident and are subject to review by all investigating entities.

TAPD will release a copy of the video when approved by counsel.
