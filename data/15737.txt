BOISE, Idaho (AP) — Authorities in southwest Idaho have identified the man shot and killed by a Boise police officer.

The Ada County Coroner's Office in a statement Tuesday says 26-year-old Michael K. Casper of Boise died from a gunshot wound to the chest.

Authorities say Officer Jason Green fired at Casper after Casper pointed a weapon at another officer.

Green has been placed on leave, and the Ada County Critical Incident Task Force is investigating.

Police say the shooting occurred at about 1:30 a.m. Monday after officers responded to a report of a man with a crowbar. Arriving officers say they heard Casper firing from inside the house.

Investigators say Casper fired shots that struck a house and parked car across the street.
