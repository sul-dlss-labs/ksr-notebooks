Jeovany Mendoza, an 18-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Saturday, Dec. 1, in the 14600 block of Saticoy Street in Van Nuys, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The shooting occurred about 8 p.m. after officers responded to a 911 call about an assault with a deadly weapon, according to sources familiar with the investigation.

When the officers arrived, sources said, Mendoza was holding a knife to a woman's throat. He refused to drop the knife after being ordered to do so by officers, at least one of whom opened fire.

Mendoza was fatally shot in the face, coroner's records show.

No officers were hurt in the confrontation, according to the sources who said the investigation was still unfolding.
