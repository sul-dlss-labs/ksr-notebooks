Riverside police Officer Nathan Asbury was handcuffing a man in Arlington Park on Dec. 31 when the man pulled a gun from his waistband and fired at Asbury’s head — from less than 2 feet away.

Asbury ducked and then fired three shots, all striking Dontae Daveon

Lewis Hayes. He died right there, on the edge of the playground. Asbury

was not injured.
