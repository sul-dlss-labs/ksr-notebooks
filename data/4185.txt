A decorated police lieutenant accused of killing his tenant over a rent dispute was acquitted by a Brooklyn Supreme Court jury yesterday after only four hours of deliberation.

Shamik Walton, a 19-year NYPD veteran, was facing 15 years if convicted in the shooting death of Byron Hearst, 27, on Mother’s Day 2005.

“I feel good. I feel vindicated,” said Walton outside the courthouse , flanked by family members.

“But it’s not over yet,” he added, referring to a $25 million civil suit the Hearst family has filed against the city and Walton.

After the jury foreman read his verdict, Walton mouthed “Thank you, thank you” to the panel.

Earlier in the week, Walton testified that in May 2005 he went to the apartment Hearst rented from him in Bedford-Stuyvesant to collect back rent. When he got there, Hearst attacked him, Walton said.

The younger man lunged at him, punched him, and shoved him to the ground, Walton said.

Walton said he told Hearst he was a cop and warned him to stop. But the crazed tenant struggled to grab Walton’s gun and was shot.
