One person was killed in a crash after carjacking suspects led police on a chase early Monday morning near Churchill Downs, according to Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad.

Several LMPD cars were involved in the chase that ended around 3:30 a.m. at South Third Street and Southern Parkway, Conrad said. Three teenage boys were ejected from the stolen car when it crashed into a utility pole.

One teenager was pronounced dead at the scene and the other two were taken to the University of Louisville Hospital with injuries. One boy was in "very serious condition."

Fourth Division officers responded to a carjacking at Second Street and Oak Street early Monday morning, Conrad said. A short while later, First Division officers saw a car matching the description of the stolen car driving along Broadway. When police tried to pull the driver over, the car took off.

LMPD's pursuit policy allows officers to chase people suspected of committing a dangerous felony. Conrad initially said the two First Division officers involved in the chase would be put on administrative leave while the Public Integrity Unit and Traffic Unit investigate; however, LMPD spokesman Dwight Mitchell later said in an email that the officers will not be placed on leave and will return to normal patrol duties.

The intersection of South Third Street and Southern Parkway temporarily closed while police investigated but reopened around 10 a.m., according to MetroSafe.
