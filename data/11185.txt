A much-needed inquiry into a police chase that ended with a motorist killed and a woman and 4-year-old boy critically injured will try to determine whether officers should have broken off their pursuit sooner.

But what about not starting that chase at all?

Among many cities nationally, where between 300 and 500 people die yearly in police chases — a third of them bystanders — Philadelphia has good reason to switch to a no-chase policy, having seen repeated, senseless carnage.

Only a year into his tenure, Police Commissioner Charles H. Ramsey had lost two officers who died in wrecks resulting from hot pursuits. Ramsey responded with an updated policy that he called "highly restrictive," requiring patrol officers to stay in constant radio contact with supervisors monitoring speed, road conditions, and the chase's duration.

A no-chase policy won't stop motorists from fleeing, as police said Gregory Alston, 39, did Friday after pointing a gun at an officer during a traffic stop. A police chase, however, could prolong a fleeing driver's dangerous progress through congested city neighborhoods.

In Alston's case, the chase put large swaths of the city, and countless motorists, at risk — even crossing a La Salle University parking lot. As much as an armed man in full flight represented a threat, which justified the chase under Ramsey's policy, the vehicle itself became a deadly weapon when it broadsided the car in which Daniel Irizarry Roman, 36, was killed while riding with his wife and son.

A no-chase policy, of course, doesn't mean officers can't catch the bad guys. The helicopter tracking Alston from above could have followed from a distance and then alerted officers to close in on the armed suspect's car. That's a much better policy than one that will lead to a higher death toll.
