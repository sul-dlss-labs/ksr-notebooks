JAMESTOWN, N.D.-A 27-year-old Jamestown man was identified Thursday, Feb. 22 as the man killed by law enforcement following a pursuit in the city that ended north of Medina.

Stutsman County Sheriff Chad Kaiser said Michael Andrew Schieffer died following the incident that began late Wednesday morning.

There was a warrant for Schieffer from the city of Bismarck for driving under suspension, Kaiser said, which prompted a Jamestown police officer to pull him over. Schieffer led Jamestown police officers on a pursuit from Jamestown into northwest Stutsman County.

Kaiser said Schieffer shot at Stutsman County Sheriff's deputies during the pursuit, which came to an end when the vehicle Schieffer was driving got stuck.

Scott Edinger, Jamestown chief of police, said Thursday the pursuing law enforcement officers stopped about a quarter to a half mile behind Schieffer. He said Schieffer got out of the vehicle holding a cellphone and handgun and walked toward law enforcement.

"When he got close to the officers, he raised the gun and fired at the officers," Edinger said. "The officers returned fire almost simultaneously and he was killed."

Kaiser said the deputies and officers performed first aid and CPR on Schieffer while the Medina Ambulance Service responded.

The incident is being investigated by the Stutsman County Sheriff's Office and the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation with support from the Jamestown Police Department.
