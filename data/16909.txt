LITTLE EGG HARBOR - A reportedly suicidal man came at police officers with a knife moments before they shot and killed him Tuesday at the Royal Timbers condominiums, authorities said.

Township police were called at 11:35 a.m. to reports of a suicidal man at the condominium complex, according to a news release from Ocean County Prosecutor's spokesman Al Della Fave. A concerned family member called the department asking officers to check on Francis D. Hartnett, a resident of 510 Willow Oaks Drive, because he was trying to harm himself.

Officers arrived at the scene, but no one appeared to be home. They got inside and identified themselves when they found Hartnett, 47, brandishing a knife. The officers told Hartnett to drop the knife, but he started moving toward them, Della Fave said.

Multiple officers fired their service weapons at Hartnett, taking him down. Della Fave did not specify how many officer fired shots or identify them.

Residents say they heard several gunshots at that moment. One neighbor, Nicholas Hall-Volpe, recalled more than a half-dozen shots ringing out.

Little Egg Harbor police shoot, kill man, authorities say

"It was nuts," he said. "Nothing like this happens around here."

Hartnett pronounced dead by a doctor at 12:36 p.m.

The Ocean County Prosecutor's Office, which was called to investigate the officer-involved incident, found Hartnett suffered from depression and had attempted suicide several times before Tuesday, Della Fave said.

The shooting happened in Royal Timbers, a modern condominium complex nestled in the woods off Center Street. The complex is about a mile from the Tall Timbers complex, where a man shot and killed his brother and a neighbor before turning the weapon on himself in 2010.
