Conflicting accounts have emerged about an Anderson County deputy’s fatal shooting of a man this week.

An autopsy conducted Tuesday found that Andrew William Aldrich, 24, died of a single gunshot wound to the chest, said Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore. A second shot fired at Aldrich missed, he said.

There were marks on Aldrich’s face and indications that he was struck in the shoulder and upper chest with a deputy’s baton, Shore said. The autopsy also found evidence that Aldrich had used methamphetamine and marijuana before his death Monday night, the coroner said.

Shortly after the shooting happened at a home on Drake Circle, Sheriff John Skipper said that the deputy and Aldrich became involved in a scuffle when Aldrich refused to put down an unspecified object. Skipper said the deputy’s Taser fell to the floor and Aldrich picked it up and pointed at the deputy. The deputy then shot Aldrich, Skipper said.

A sheriff’s report released Tuesday indicates that Deputy Justin A. Bannister went to the home at 110 Drake Circle in response to a domestic disturbance call. Bannister wrote in the report that a deputy Davis also responded to the call. Skipper said Tuesday that the second deputy was Shawn Davis.

Citing an ongoing investigation by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division, Skipper did not identify which deputy shot Aldrich. He said the two deputies involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. According to Skipper, Davis has been employed at the sheriff’s office longer than Bannister, whom he described as “fairly new.”

A South Carolina Law Enforcement Division spokesman refused to reveal any information about the case.

“It would be inappropriate for SLED to discuss any specific details while an investigation is underway,” agency spokesman Thom Berry said.

The sheriff’s report offers some details that vary from Skipper’s version of events on Monday night.

The report says that Aldrich assaulted a woman inside the home as deputies tried to escort him outside.

Bannister wrote in the report, “I attempted to restrain Aldrich from grabbing the female, at which time, a physical altercation began between myself, Aldrich, and also Deputy Davis who was on scene assisting me.”

Bannister wrote in the report that Aldrich struck him in the head and kicked him several times.

“During the altercation, Aldrich was able to take my county issued Taser, and was beginning to stand up while pointing it in mine and Deputy Davis’ direction,” Bannister wrote. “At that time lethal force was used to eliminate the threat.”

Aldrich’s longtime girlfriend, Marina Wooten, offered a sharply contrasting account of Monday night’s events. She and Aldrich are the parents of a 1-year-old girl who was in the home when deputies arrived there Monday night.

Wooten said she accidentally called 911 on her cellphone. When deputies came 20 minutes later, Wooten said, she told them that she had not been harmed.

Wooten said the deputies went inside, dragged Aldrich out of a bedroom and told him to empty his pockets, which he did.

According to Wooten, Aldrich then agreed to walk out of the home accompanied by Wooten and their baby.

“There were no weapons on him,” she said. “He was voluntarily trying to walk outside.”

Wooten said one of the deputies tried to separate her and Aldrich, which is when the physical altercation started.

The deputy “just threw him to the ground,” Wooten said. “They tased him like three times, and he was like, ‘I quit. I quit.’”

Shore said the autopsy found no indication that Aldrich was tased.

Wooten said one of the deputies struck Aldrich in the face several times with his baton before shooting him.

“They took it too far,” she said. “All he wanted to do is come out here with me.”

A copy of a search warrant given to Wooten states that two shells, one bullet and a Taser projectile were found in the home. The warrant also says that one container of a leafy green substance, two marijuana pipes, a syringe and a plastic baggie with white powdery substance were seized.

According to court records, Aldrich had been arrested 20 times since 2007. In 2012 Aldrich received a three-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to charges that included possession of methamphetamine, possession of a stolen vehicle and receiving stolen goods. His most recent arrest was on Oct. 4, when he was charged with two counts of third-degree assault and battery. He was released from the Anderson County Detention Center the next day on personal recognizance bonds.

Monday night’s fatal shooting was the second death in as many days involving deputes. On Sunday afternoon, 31-year-old Brad Evans died after he was tased twice by deputies following a car chase that began in Townville and ended in Starr. Shore said an autopsy found that the Iva man died of a combination of drug use and a heart condition.

Skipper said Tuesday that chases and confrontations involving deputies and suspects seem to happening more often, not only in Anderson County but in other parts of South Carolina and throughout the nation.

“I don’t know if it is our society or what,” Skipper said, “but this is getting to be a regular thing.”
