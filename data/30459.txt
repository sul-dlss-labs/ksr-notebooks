LEE COUNTY, Ala. (WTVM) - The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting in Lee County.

According to ALEA, the shooting involved deputies with the Lee County Sheriff’s Office and troopers within ALEA’s Highway Patrol Division.

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office was notified of an individual armed with a shotgun on Lee Road 206, near Uchee Creek, around 1:06 a.m. Saturday.

ALEA says deputies and troopers responded to the scene. A stand-off ensued and several attempts were made to get the suspect to drop the gun.

The Lee County Sheriff’s Office checked the registration of a nearby vehicle and contacted the registered owner who confirmed ownership, advised police that her son was driving the vehicle, and provided a description that matched the man holding the gun.

Officials say the vehicle owner advised 911 dispatchers that her son suffered from mental health issues. A trained negotiator with the Opelika Police Department responded to the scene and began efforts to communicate with the man while receiving information from his mother.

The suspect continued to hold the gun and occasionally pointed the gun in the direction of officers, according to ALEA and the Lee County Sherriff’s Office.

Officials say efforts continued to get the man to put the gun down for over an hour and a half until he pointed the gun directly at law enforcement officers, which resulted in the suspect being shot, ALEA says.

The suspect, according to authorities, was 20-year-old Jeff Melvin, of Salem. He was transported to Piedmont Columbus Regional hospital where he died of his injuries.

No officers were injured during the incident. The Lee County Sherriff’s Office says three deputies have been placed on administrative leave as is protocol.

Once ALEA’s investigation is complete, the findings will be turned over to the Lee County District Attorney’s Office.
