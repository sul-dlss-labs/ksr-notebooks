PHOENIX (AP) - Phoenix police have released the identity of an armed man fatally shot during an encounter with two officers.

Police say 29-year-old Hector Lopez was killed Thursday when he struggled with and then pointed a gun at officers who had responded to a trespassing call.

Police say no officers were injured and that a woman who was with Lopez was arrested on an unrelated felony warrant.

According to police, a handgun fell to the ground when Lopez opened a car door as the officers approached and that a struggle ensued when Lopez dove toward the gun and grabbed it.

Police said one officer struggled with Lopez while the other officer struck Lopez and used a stun gun.

According to police, the officers shot Lopez when he pointed the gun at them.
