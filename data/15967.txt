RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) — A man died after a driver broadsided his car following a police chase — the second fatality in the San Francisco Bay Area linked to a police pursuit in two days.

The most recent crash occurred around 9:30 p.m. Saturday in Richmond after an officer tried to pull the suspect over for reckless driving in a residential area, Richmond Police Capt. Bisa French said.

The driver failed to stop, and the officer began pursuing him.

But French said the officer stopped the pursuit after losing sight of the suspect’s Corvette. About a minute later, the Corvette crashed into a Honda carrying Anthony Nguyen, 24, of San Pablo, and two other men in their 20s, French said.

Nguyen died at the scene. A second passenger was ejected from the car and suffered life-threatening injuries. The driver was also injured, but expected to survive.

French said the suspect, 20-year-old Epigmenio Perez, of San Pablo, ran away, but was later arrested on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated. Perez called the police to report his Corvette had been carjacked, but acknowledged during questioning later that he was the driver, French said.

She did not know whether Perez had an attorney.

Nguyen’s death came a day after a pedestrian was struck and killed in a crosswalk in San Francisco during a wild police pursuit.

Bridget Klecker, 42, of San Francisco, was hit Friday night while police chased armed robbery suspects.

The car later hit a second pedestrian and then crashed into another car before slipping away from police in San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood. The second pedestrian suffered non-life-threatening injuries.
