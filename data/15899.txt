The Los Angeles County coroner’s office on Friday identified a possibly suicidal knife-wielding man killed in an officer-involved shooting in Wilmington as 35-year-old Adrian Solis.

The Wilmington resident died at the scene of the shooting, which occurred about 9:30 a.m. Thursday in the 1500 block of Bayview Avenue, said Los Angeles police Officer Jack Richter. No officers were injured.

Officers went to the scene after someone called police to report an attempted suicide at the location, LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar told reporters at the scene.

“When they responded, they did encounter the subject of that radio call, who was, indeed, armed with a knife,’’ Aguilar said. “An officer-involved shooting occurred, and (the) Los Angeles Fire Department responded and pronounced that person dead at scene.’’

Aguilar said the call to police about the attempted suicide was made by someone whose relationship with the fatally wounded man, if any, was unknown.
