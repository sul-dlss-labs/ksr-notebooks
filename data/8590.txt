November 9, 2009 - An armed suspect was fatally shot during a struggle with Houston police officers at 6200 Bellaire about 10:55 p.m. on Saturday (Nov. 7).

The male suspect, 26, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. His identify is pending verification by the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant C. Elliott and Officer A. Mares reported:

Officers patrolling the southwest Houston area observed three males walking through a convenience store parking lot. One of the individuals was seen carrying an open container of beer. Officers stopped the three males on the liquor violation and began searching them for possible weapons.

As the officers completed their search of one individual, the suspect attempted to flee and then began struggling with the officers. During the struggle, the suspect reached into his waistband and drew a pistol. At that time, Officer Lucero discharged his duty weapon, fatally striking the suspect.

As is customary in all HPD officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the incident will be investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, as well as the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
