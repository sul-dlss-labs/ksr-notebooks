Officials said Vitullo had threatened police with a gun during a standoff on Lake Avenue on Monday morning.

Officers were called to an apartment building in the 3700 block of Lake Avenue around 4:30 a.m. Monday for a report that a man there had threatened someone with a shotgun. A standoff ensued, with the suspect firing at least twice from inside the apartment building around 6:10 a.m. Police closed the roadway between Britton Road and Denise Road.

Around 8:49.a.m., Vitullo leaned out of an apartment window with a shotgun and Officer Jeremy Nellist fired once, striking and killing him.

Nellist has been with the police department for seven years, and a member of the department's SWAT unit for four years, according to police. He will be assigned to administrative duties pending an investigation of Monday's shooting.
