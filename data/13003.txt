The polls will be open until 8 p.m. for Tuesday's special election for U.S. Senate between Republican Gabriel Gomez of Cohasset and Cong. Edward Markey of Malden.

The winner will serve out the 18 months remaining in the term of Sen. John Kerry, who resigned when he became Secretary of State. That means Massachusetts voters in November 2014 will elect a senator for the fourth time in five years.
