PAMLICO COUNTY, N.C. (WITN) - Authorities now say a Pamlico County man was killed in an officer-involved shooting Monday night outside of Oriental.

Pamlico County Sheriff Chris Davis confirms the shooting happened on Kennels Beach Road.

The SBI and District Attorney’s office has been called in to investigate.

“I think this case will reveal that these guys did everything they could to not exchange gunfire and not have to fire their weapon, but at the end of the day they also have to protect their self and their community,” said Pamlico County Sheriff, Chris Davis.

District Attorney Scott Thomas says 71-year-old Marvin Hitchcock, Jr. was shot and killed when deputies tried to arrest him for failing to appear in court on driving while impaired and other related charges.

“Ultimately you don’t even want to have to take somebodies life, but unfortunately, things do happen and when those things happen our guys are well equipped and well trained to make the best decision possible,” Davis said.

Thomas said Hitchcock had a handgun and was using it in a threatening manner. After the first deputy got backup, they spoke to the man for nearly 30 minutes, and he continued to hold the gun in a threatening manner towards himself and the officers.

Davis warns against this kind of response to law enforcement officers, “If you pull a gun on law enforcement you have to expect that bad thing are going to happen.”

The D.A. said more than one law enforcement officer fired their weapon at Hitchcock. The man died at the scene.

A Pamlico County deputy received minor injuries and was treated and released from the hospital, Thomas said.

In addition to Pamlico County deputies, state troopers, Oriental police, and North Carolina Probation and Parole officers were either present, involved with, or were witnesses to the shooting.
