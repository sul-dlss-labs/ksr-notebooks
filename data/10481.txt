GLENWOOD, Ill. (CBS) -- A Glenwood police officer shot and killed a 39-year-old man who tried to run him down early Friday morning in nearby south suburban Harvey.

At about 2:50 a.m. Friday, Chicago Heights police called Glenwood police for assistance in the pursuit of a vehicle, Glenwood police Chief Demitrous Cook said.

"It was coming through our town,'' he said, so Glenwood officers joined the pursuit.

When the vehicle reached the 15900 block of South Loomis in Harvey, the driver tried to strike a Glenwood police officer with the car, Cook said.

Fearing for his life, the officer shot the suspect with his service weapon, the chief said.

The suspect, identified as Mateo Meza-Cortez, of 296 E. 157th St. in Harvey, was pronounced dead at 3:42 a.m. at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office. An autopsy determined he died of multiple gunshot wounds and his death was ruled a homicide.

The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Unit is investigating the shooting.
