The authorities said he opened fire as the officers entered the basement, then climbed out a window and continued the gun battle in a backyard. When the smoke cleared shortly after 8 p.m., Mr. Alalouf was dead and two more officers had been shot, one of them in the face, and six others had been injured.

All were taken to Kings County Hospital Center. The officer shot in the face was in critical condition, the other wounded officers were serious but stable, and six others were treated for injuries ranging from pellet graze wounds and cuts to bruises and bites inflicted by the gunmen's four dogs.

Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who went to the hospital twice for news conferences, called the officers heroes of the first order. ''I don't believe any emergency services in the country could have done any better,'' he said. ''This is one of the times in which you recognize that our emergency services in New York City are the best in the world. Today, a number of them put their lives at risk with tremendous professionalism and tremendous restraint.''

Little was known about the gunman. The police and Mayor Giuliani said that he had been a correction officer from 1982 to 1984, but it was not clear why he had left city service or what he had done in recent years, though he had lived with his parents and a sister. He had no criminal record, the police said, but it was unclear if he had a history of mental illness.

The day's tragic drama began, the police said, when Mr. Alalouf's mother and sister, whose names were not released, went to the 61st Precinct station house and told Sgt. Janet Velez that he was apparently emotionally distraught, and was armed and dangerous.
