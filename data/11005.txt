BOWIE COUNTY, TX (KSLA) - Authorities have released the name of the man shot to death by a Texas Parks and Wildlife officer in Bowie County on Thursday.

The Bowie County Sheriff's Office says 56-year-old Frank Anthony Schoen was shot and killed after firing a shot in the direction of two law enforcement officers.

Before deputies arrived, the call was upgraded to a vehicular accident with shots fired at a person.

According to the BCSO news release, "Upon arrival, the Deputy observed a white male standing beside the suspect vehicle. The Deputy instructed the suspect several times to get on the ground face down, however the suspect did not comply. A Liberty Eylau School District police officer and a Texas Game Warden arrived to assist the Bowie County Deputy. Officer continued to instruct the suspect to get on the ground face down, but he would not comply. The Deputy states at that point the suspect pulled his weapon with his right hand, raised it up in the air and fired one round.
