A wanted parolee shot to death when he allegedly backed an RV into a sheriff’s patrol car and attempted to run over a deputy was identified as Anthony Michael Axe of Torrance, authorities said Thursday.

Axe, 34, died Aug. 29 when deputies confronted him in the 21200 block of South Figueroa Street in Carson.

When deputies approached the recreational vehicle, Axe tried to drive away from them, backing into the patrol car and injuring a deputy.

He then drove forward toward a deputy standing in front of the driver’s side of the vehicle, deputies said.

Another deputy, fearing the fellow deputy would be hit, shot Axe, who then crashed into a block wall.

County court records showed Axe had arrests or convictions since 1997 for auto burglary, driving under the influence, possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine, auto theft and attempted robbery.
