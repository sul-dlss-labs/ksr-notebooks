HIGHGROVE (CBSLA.com) — A man was shot and killed early on Saturday after a traffic stop suddenly escalated into a shootout with California Highway Patrol officers just north of Riverside.

The shooting took place just before 2 a.m., at East La Cadena Drive and Iowa Avenue, next to the northbound lanes of the 215 Freeway in Highgrove, the Riverside County Sheriff's Department said.

CHP officers had been conducting a traffic stop on a vehicle when its male driver stepped out of the car and fired at the officers, the Sheriff's Department said.

The driver's shots struck the CHP vehicle. Officers returned fire, wounding the driver, who was able to reenter his vehicle.

The man attempted to drive away, but did not get far, stopping at a nearby fence. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A male passenger ran into the night and his whereabouts were unknown on Saturday, the Sheriff's Department said. No description of the passenger was available.

The right lanes of the northbound 215 Freeway were closed as of 11 a.m. as deputies investigated the shooting.
