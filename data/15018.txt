Anoka County investigators have determined that two city of Ramsey police officers who fatally shot a man outside of a day care center in August were justified in using their weapons.

The Anoka County Attorney's Office declined to issue charges against Ramsey Police officers Jerad Dixon and Richard Webb.

On Aug. 28, the two officers responded to a call of a suspicious vehicle outside the Learning Lodge day care center in Ramsey. When they arrived, a man jumped out of the car and began running away.

According to police reports the man pulled a gun out as the officers chased him. Dixon and Webb told him to stop and drop the gun. When he didn't, they shot him.

The man, identified as 21-year-old Chaz Havenor of Marenisco, Michigan, died later at Mercy Hospital in Coon Rapids.

Paul Young, a spokesman for the County Attorney's Office, said all evidence showed the officers were in imminent danger.

"It is unfortunate and regrettable that a routine police matter became so dangerous and then turned fatal," said Anoka County Attorney Tony Palumbo in a statement.

The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension examined surveillance video, interviewed witnesses and performed forensic and ballastic tests, according to the attorney's office.

The toxicology report for Havenor showed he had amphetamine and methamphetamine in his blood. A round was found in the chamber of his pistol, according to the attorney's office.
