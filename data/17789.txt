Tulsa police have identified the sergeant and suspect involved in a fatal shooting Wednesday afternoon.

Police said Sergeant Steve Stoltz was putting out stop sticks when a chase suspect, 43-year-old Russell Rosser, appeared to swerve, trying to hit Stoltz. They said the sergeant opened fire, killing Rosser.

Stoltz is on administrative leave with pay while police investigate. He has been on the force since 1998.

Police said it started around 4:30 p.m., when an officer attempted to pull over a truck in the 800 block of North Louisville Avenue. They said the driver, instead rammed the police vehicle and drove off.

Officers continued to chase Rosser and the truck, which they said rammed a second police vehicle before he was shot and killed.

At one point during the chase, Kinard said a passenger jumped out of the truck and ran; police are still searching for that man.

Police said they found a revolver on the suspect.



"We don't know why this individual chose to initially flee, maybe because he knew his vehicle was stolen," TPD Officer Leland Ashley said. "This individual took several actions to try to avoid arrest."

Leland Ashley with TPD says the first crash injured an officer.

"One of the officers, I think, suffered damage to his hand because his airbag deployed during one of the collisions," Ashely said. "But I believe that's the only injury and I believe it was minor."
