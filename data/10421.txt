Christopher Moreno, a 38-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by police Saturday, July 30, in the 500 block of Echandia Street in Boyle Heights, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The fatal shooting took place after a series of events that day that began when Moreno, at the time in custody at the Twin Towers jail in downtown, was injured in a fight. While he was being taken by ambulance to County-USC Medical Center, he attacked the paramedics riding with him about 2:30 p.m, authorities say.

Moreno then jumped out of the moving ambulance in Boyle Heights, near Mission Road and Richmond Street. He ran into El Divino Salvador Presbyterian Church on Echandia Street, police said.

When officers searched the church with a police dog, Moreno jumped one of them and stabbed him through the left bicep with an 8-inch butcher knife, according to LAPD Cmdr. Andrew Smith.

At least one of the officers fired multiple shots at Moreno, killing him, Smith said.

The injured officer was taken to the hospital for his injury, but he has since been released.

Smith said no security was provided during the ambulance trip to the hospital because the man had just been officially released from County Jail, where he was being held on a misdemeanor charge.

Police released no other details about the shooting.
