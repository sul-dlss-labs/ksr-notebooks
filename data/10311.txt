Milwaukee Police Chief Edward A. Flynn on Sunday described the circumstances under which a police officer fatally shot an armed man.

The victim, Latare Nixon, 37, was killed in the 3100 block of N. 44th St. early Sunday after firing several shots at the officer, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. The officer, 37, who is assigned to District 7, has five years of service. He was not injured.

"This is the eighth time this year one of our officers has been involved in a shooting," Flynn said. "The man is now deceased."

Police had responded to a call at 5:25 a.m. Sunday from Nixon's ex-girlfriend, saying he was trying to break into her house, when the shooting occurred.

Flynn did not identify the officer who was involved in the shooting but did say the officer was decorated for heroism in May.

The Milwaukee Police Department and the Milwaukee County district attorney's office are investigating the incident. The officer who fired his weapon was placed on administrative duty, which standard procedure after such an incident, pending completion of the investigation.

Police said an autopsy on the body of the dead man was planned for Monday.

Flynn spoke repeatedly of how officers put themselves in harm's way - and do so willingly - to protect the community.

Flynn said about 160 people in Milwaukee have been wounded by gunfire so far this year. He added that eight officers had been shot in the line of duty in the last four years.

Flynn also commented on the state's new concealed-carry law, saying a gaping hole in it would prohibit only convicted felons from carrying weapons.

He said 85% of the offenders that Milwaukee police arrested last year would not have fallen under the new law.

"That law was written in total ignorance of urban reality," Flynn said.
