Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies shot and killed an intruder early Friday after he “entered a home that did not belong to him,” officials said.

The shooting occurred around 1:15 a.m. Friday in the 800 block of Ashcomb Drive in La Puente, according to a Sheriff’s Department news release.

When the man went into the home, a resident left the house and alerted deputies that there was someone inside. Sheriff’s deputies entered the home and “gave verbal commands to the suspect.” But when the man grabbed for the deputy’s gun, officials say, the deputy shot him.

The intruder was shot once in the torso, the news release said, and pronounced dead. A knife, which sheriff’s officials believe belonged to the man, was found at the scene.

None of the residents in the home, or any sheriff’s deputies, were injured.

It’s not clear whether the resident initially called 911 for help or how the person alerted deputies to the intruder.

Sheriff’s deputies declined to release any further information, including the identity of the man, citing the ongoing investigation.
