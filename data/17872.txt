A man involved in a high speed chase and standoff with police is dead, Garland police said. Late Saturday, police identified the man as 32-year-old Alfredo Vargas Patino of Dallas.

The chase, which began as a domestic incident, started near Centerville Road and Broadway Boulevard in Garland. A woman called 911 and told police she was being followed by her child's father, police said.

When police tried to pull over Patino, he led officers on a high-speed car chase down I-635 and west toward Irving, police said. During the pursuit, shots were fired at officers.

"While our officers were pursuing the vehicle, the driver of the vehicle began shooting at our officers," said Lt. Pedro Barineau.

The chase ended in a parking lot along I-635 between Beltline Road and Freeport Parkway.

Police said Patino died from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Garland PD said he had a warrant for a Family Violence related offense.

A woman was also in the vehicle with the suspect, but it's not clear how she knew him or the role she played in the chase. Police identified her as 28-year-old Vanessa Barron of Dallas. She was arrested but later released.
