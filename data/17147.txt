A man identified as Jordan Szymanski was shot and killed early Monday following an overnight standoff with Tucson police at an apartment complex on Tucson’s north side.

The incident started about 5 p.m. Sunday when police were called to the complex on West Roger Road just east of North Oracle Road, said Sgt. Kimberly Bay, a department spokeswoman.

Over several hours Szymanski made threats of violence, and gunfire was heard coming from the apartment in which he was barricaded, she said.

Later Sunday, Tucson officers learned from Oro Valley police that Szymanski had threatened to shoot a resident there, Bay said. The single-story complex was evacuated about 9 p.m. following more gunfire.

About 3 a.m. Szymanski emerged from the resident and fired several shots. That’s when Tucson Police SWAT officer Brandon Jimenez returned fire, striking Szymanski, Bay said.

Szymanski was declared dead at the scene.

No officers were wounded.
