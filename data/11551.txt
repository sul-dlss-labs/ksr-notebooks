The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has released the names of an officer and a suspect involved in a fatal shooting in North Branch over the weekend.

Chisago County sheriff’s deputy Steven Gregory Husmann shot and killed Robert Elias Aho while responding to a report of a domestic dispute, according to a statement from the BCA, which is investigating the incident.

Officers from several agencies responded to the call just before 9:30 p.m. Sunday, July 8, at Aho’s home at 38090 Feaski Circle in North Branch.

The caller said Aho had threatened his wife with a gun, the BCA statement said.

When officers arrived, the wife and other family members had left the house and the garage door was open. Officers were near the garage door when Aho reportedly emerged from the home through the service door holding a shotgun and a rifle, according to the BCA.

Aho had the gun barrels pointed up and “ignored repeated instructions to put the weapons down, and then lowered the barrel of one of the weapons to point at the officers,” the BCA said.

Husmann shot at Aho, hitting him twice.Aho, 46, died Regions Hospital in St. Paul.

Husmann is a nine-year veteran of the Chisago County sheriff’s office. He and other responding officers — Chisago County sheriff’s Sgt. Robert Scott Berg, Chisago County sheriff’s deputy Derek Dean Anklan and North Branch police officer Rebecca Lynn Lawrence — have been placed on standard administrative leave, the BCA said.

The investigation continues. When complete, the BCA will forward its findings to the Chisago County attorney’s office for review for possible criminal charges.

The last officer-involved shooting in Chisago County was in 2005, according to the sheriff’s office.

Five line-of-duty shootings have occurred statewide so far in 2012, according to BCA records.
