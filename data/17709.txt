FORT COLLINS, Colo. (CBS4) - A serial window peeping suspect in Fort Collins took his own life as police were attempting to serve a search warrant.

On Wednesday deputies arrested Steven Lee Christensen for his alleged involvement in a number of window peeping cases over the last six months.

Investigators said several residents of Circle Drive reported suspicious activity on and around their property during the past several months. On several of the occasions, surveillance cameras captured the male suspect, later identified as Christensen, 57, on video.

According to Jered Kramer with the Larimer County Sheriff's Office, deputies responded to Christensen's home to assist Fort Collins police with service of a search warrant on Friday.

"While officers were attempting contact at the front door of the property at approximately 10:30 a.m., a gunshot was heard. A deceased male was located on the property with apparently self-inflicted gunshot wounds," Kramer said in a statement.

No officers fired their weapons and nobody else was hurt.
