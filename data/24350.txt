A 32-year-old man who was killed by police in a North Shore shooting last month was identified today by the Honolulu Medical Examinerâ€™s office as Steven Hyer Jr., of Haleiwa.

The office said a gunshot wound to the torso killed Hyer and the manner of his death was a homicide.

A Honolulu police officer shot Hyer three times in the early morning of June 23 after Hyer began stabbing a police dog with an arrow.

Police said the incident began about nine hours earlier when officers were sent to investigate an argument on Kapuai Place near Sunset Beach.

Officers were able to calm Hyer down and left the scene, but they returned about two hours later in response to another call about Hyer appearing delusional and threatening his neighbors.

Hyer was approved by a police psychologist for a mental health evaluation, but he refused to come out of his apartment, sparking a seven hour standoff with police.

Officers saw Hyer with multiple knives and a bow and arrow in his home, and at one point, he came to his patio door with a knife, police said. An officer shot him with a stun gun, but he went back inside.

Police said officers tried to talk with Hyer for several hours and also used tear gas to try to get him to come out.

When he eventually exited his home with a bow and arrow at about 3 a.m., police moved in, releasing a canine when Hyer tried to go back inside.

Police said Hyer began stabbing the dog with an arrow and an officer fired three rounds fearing for the lives of the animal and the nearby officers. All three rounds hit Hyer, police said.

He was taken to a hospital where he died. The dog underwent surgery and was expected to fully recover.

The officer who fired the shots has 25 years of service with the police department and was placed on administrative leave, as is standard policy, police said.
