A teenager has been sentenced to 18 months unsupervised probation in connection with a fiery fatal crash in Chevy Chase, Md., News4's Jackie Bensen reported.



Reeco Richardson, 19, was convicted of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and two other charges in October. He had faced up to seven years in prison.



Richardson was one of four teens joy-riding in a stolen Toyota Echo in March. They were being pursued by police when their car slammed into a tree at Chevy Chase Circle and burst into flames.



Emanuel Nelson, 16, and Kyree Nelson, 14, died in the crash. The driver, Reynard Osman, 16, died five days later.



Richardson claims police rammed the car, causing it to hit the tree. He has filed a $10 million lawsuit.

A Montgomery County judge said Richardson made a bad decision that led to awful consequences but said he is making a sincere effort to turn around his life, Bensen reported.
