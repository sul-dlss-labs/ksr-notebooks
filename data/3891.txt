On Jan. 4, 2005, Santa Clara Police officers shot Eric Kleemeyer seven times after a traffic stop for erratic driving that turned into a chase when Mr. Kleemeyer failed to stop. The 22-year-old drove to his mother’s home instead, where police stated they opened fire after Mr. Kleemeyer rammed a police vehicle with his car – a fact the family disputes. Mr. Kleemeyer, who was unarmed, was driving on a suspended license.

The Grand Jury declined to indict the Santa Clara Police officers involved. Last week, SCU students heard about a civil action currently underway by the law offices of Anthony Pagkas, who is representing the family of Mr. Kleemeyer. SCU law alumni and Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Dan Nishigaya will be present on Tuesday 4/26 at noon for a Criminal Law Society event regarding Grand Jury proceedings and the DA office protocol as to police shootings. Mr. Nishigaya was the prosecutor for the Kleemeyer Grand Jury proceedings. He was also the prosecutor in the 2003 open Grand Jury proceedings for the shooting of a San Jose Vietnamese woman who wielded an asian vegetable peeler and whose death sparked a public outrage.

Come join us for our last event of this year: Bannan 139 from 12 to 1.

Lunch will be provided.
