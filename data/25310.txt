A Lebanon County man, who was fatally shot by a state police trooper Tuesday, was coming at the trooper with a knife at the time of shooting, according to police.

Police also noted that the trooper slipped and fell to his back just before firing his weapon.

About 10:30 a.m. Tuesday, Mitchell J. Hammer, 27, of Annville was being pursued by a trooper along a creek in a wooded area, and, when the trooper rounded a bend, Hammer came toward him with a knife, police said in a Friday news release.

Police said Hammer was equipped with an 8-inch knife, and the trooper made “attempts to gain cover,” but he slipped, falling on his back, “at which time he fired his department issued handgun.”

Hammer was shot, and later died from his injuries.

On Monday, it was reported that Hammer was involved in an assault in a home on Jonestown Road in East Hanover Township, where police said he became angry with a woman and chased her with a knife.

According to police, the woman hid in the bathroom, but Hammer was pounding on the door with the knife still in his hand. Hammer eventually used the knife to punch a hole through the door, and the woman was cut on her right hand in the process, police said.

On Tuesday, troopers attempted to serve an arrest warrant related to the assault at Hammer’s place of employment, Boots and Hanks Truck Parts on Coon Creek Road, and Hammer fled, leading to the subsequent pursuit and shooting, according to police.

After Hammer was shot, troopers carried him through the woods to a state police helicopter, which flew him to Hershey Medical Center, where he died from his injuries, police said.

No troopers were injured in the incident, and the trooper who shot Hammer is on paid administrative leave until the Lebanon County District Attorney clears the shooting, Tpr. David Beohm said during a Tuesday evening press conference.
