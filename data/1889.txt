Police say the man was arguing with his girlfriend and things got out of control . They say the man held her hostage in a shed outside her Phenix City home around six-o-clock wednesday evening.

Police have not released their names but a relative told us the man is 34-year-old David Spann.

She said Spann had been physically and mentally abusive in the past, and the girlfriend had called the police on him.

Spann reportedly refused to give himself up to police.

And just moments before police shot and killed Spann, this is what a neighbor said he heard.

Jonathan Green, a neighbor said, " Him saying that he wasn't coming out of the house for nothing. There weren't nothing they could do to get him out of the house."
