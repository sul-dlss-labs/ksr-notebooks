An Indianapolis woman and her 9-year-old son were fatally injured when their car was struck at an intersection by another car being pursued by police. The woman's fiance was hospitalized in good condition.

"I was about halfway through the turn when I looked through the passenger window and saw the little red car coming. Before I knew it, he T-boned me," said Luther Page, who was driving the victims' car.

When the car came to a stop, he saw his fiancee, Tameka Anthony, 27, slumped over next to him, bleeding from chest and head injuries. In the back seat was her son, Charles.

"I'm in shock. I said, 'Quit playing,' and shook his shoulder, and he wasn't moving," Page said.

The collision occurred about 10 minutes after a high-speed chase began on the city's east side Saturday evening in heavy rain. Police were chasing a driver who had been stopped for erratic driving and then drove off when an officer approached on foot.

Just as police were about to call off the pursuit because of the slick conditions, the car hit the victims' car.

Charles was pronounced dead at the scene, and his mother died about five hours later at Wishard Memorial Hospital.

The driver of the other car, identified by police as Nathaniel Williams, 19, underwent surgery for an eye injury from the crash and was expected to be transferred to the Marion County Jail. He faces preliminary charges of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated, criminal recklessness, reckless homicide, resisting arrest and leaving the scene of a property damage accident.
