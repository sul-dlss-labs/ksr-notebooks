Malik Ali Malik, 39, died the night of April 17 when the vehicle he was driving hit a tree in the 7100 block of Dinsmore Road.

The accident came at the end of a 5-minute police pursuit on State Road 45 through western Monroe County.

Monroe County Sheriff’s Office deputies were following Malik to arrest him on outstanding warrants issued from Monroe Circuit Court.

A supervisor had called off the chase when speeds surpassed 100 mph, but a deputy who encountered the vehicle a few minutes later got behind the 2021 Kia Sportage Malik was driving and pursued him again at speeds of about 70 mph on the 50-mph, two-lane highway.

The crash happened about 8:50 p.m. after Malik turned onto rural Dinsmore Road and hit a tree in a sharp curve.
