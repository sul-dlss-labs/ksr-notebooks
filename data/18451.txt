CHICKASHA, Okla. – Authorities are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting that occurred early Saturday morning.

Investigators say Chickasha officers were called to a home in the 1900 block of Montana following a disturbance around 2 a.m.

“We’re really shocked to hear all of it happened,” Tabatha Davidson said.

Davidson is one of many Chickasha residents rattled after the early Saturday morning shooting.

“When I woke up and came out there were saw horses blocking off that road. I walked up to, who I assume was a police officer, they didn`t have uniform, but I walked up and asked what was going on,” Agnes Kuhlman, another resident, said.

According to the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, officers were told the man causing the disturbance had a gun.

When officers went inside, 56-year-old Steve Dwanyne Vananda allegedly grabbed a handgun. An officer exchanged gunfire and Vananda was shot at least one time. He died at the scene.

“From what I`m aware of knowing the family, they don`t even keep bullets in the house. I mean they have the gun but they don`t keep it loaded considering he`s been suicidal for so many years after his wife died,” Davidson said.

OSBI is investigating and the officer has been put on routine paid leave for the time being.

As word spreads around town, those who know Vananda are getting frustrated.

“I’ve tried telling people on Facebook you know hey, he’s a good man don’t judge him you know. I don’t think he really shot at them like people are saying. So, we’re just trying to make sure that that stays straight for the family,” Davidson said.

When they finish gathering evidence and information, the OSBI will turn over a written report to the district attorney who will determine whether or not the shooting is justified.
