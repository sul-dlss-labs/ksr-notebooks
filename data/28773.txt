A man who was shot to death when he allegedly fired at deputies as they arrived to serve a warrant at a Compton area home was publicly identified Saturday.

Samuel Herrera Jr. was 41 and a Compton resident, coroner’s officials said.

The shooting was reported about 5:35 a.m. Thursday in the 500 block of South Bradfield Avenue, according to the sheriff’s department.

Anti-gang detectives were serving a warrant when the subject of the warrant opened fire on them and they returned fire, Sheriff Alex Villanueva alleged.

The suspect fled to the garage area and set a fire, apparently trying to destroy evidence, Villanueva said. Firefighters doused the flames.

A weapon was recovered at the scene.

No deputies were injured.
