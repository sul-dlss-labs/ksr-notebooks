MOBILE, Ala. (WKRG) — A suspect in Wednesday’s Blair Avenue shooting shot himself and died Thursday morning after Mobile Police spotted him and chased him on foot, police confirmed.

Multiple police units responded to the scene on South Ann St. in midtown Mobile. A witness who wished to remain anonymous spoke with us about what she saw saying “My friend who was cleaning with me walked past the window and saw that there was two cops pointing a gun at somebody and we went outside and he had a weapon and was pointing at this dude over here and it was pointed at the cops. It was really shocking just to see that happen right in front of you, really shocking.”

That scene, next to the Alabama School of Math and Science, caused traffic diversions for a little over an hour.

WKRG does not typically report suicides. In this case, because the deceased was a suspect in a shooting, we are covering the story.
