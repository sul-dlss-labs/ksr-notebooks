Derrick Abernathy, a 20-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy Saturday, Jan. 8, in the 8000 block of Wadsworth Avenue in Florence, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The shooting occurred early Saturday and is under investigation, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

Abernathy was pronounced dead at the scene. No deputies were injured.

Because the shooting involved a law enforcement officer, it will be investigated by three separate units â€” the sheriff's homicide and internal affairs bureaus as well as the Los Angeles County district attorney's office.

The Times will provide more information about the shooting as soon as details become available.

[Updated at 11:04 a.m., Jan. 18: Sheriff's Department homicide Det. Kevin Lowe, who is handling the investigation, said a two-man unit was driving north on Central Avenue when the officers heard gunshots early that Saturday morning.

The deputies saw people running and a white compact car driving west on 82nd Street, Lowe said. When they chased the car north on Wadsworth Avenue, a man, later identified as Derrick Abernathy, exited the vehicle.

"At that point is when the deputy-involved shooting occurred," Lowe said.

Detectives investigating the shooting determined the gunshots originally heard by the deputies came from an exchange of gunfire between Abernathy and a group of people in an alley, according to authorities.

"It was a 'Where are you from?' type of situation," Lowe said. Abernathy, he said, was a documented gang member.

Authorities do not believe anyone was hurt in the initial shooting. Investigators, however, are still trying to identify and locate the people involved in that confrontation.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Det. Lowe at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters who would like to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.]
