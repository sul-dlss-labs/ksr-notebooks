SCHENECTADY (AP) — Authorities have released the name of the Schenectady man fatally shot by a police officer after he attacked his roommate with knife and lunged at an officer. Schenectady police officials on Friday identified the man as 40-year-old Julio Colon. Police say they received a call Thursday morning reporting a fight at the apartment building where Colon lived with another man. When officers arrived at Colon’s apartment, they found him holding a knife to the other man’s bloody chest. Police say when Sgt. Daryl Mallard, a 10-year veteran, ordered him to drop the knife, Colon lunged at his roommate and Mallard shot him in the chest. Colon then charged the sergeant, who shot him twice more. He was pronounced dead at a hospital. His roommate is expected to recover.
