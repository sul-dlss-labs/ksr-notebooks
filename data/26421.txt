ROCHESTER - The man who prompted a seven-hour standoff with police after shooting at an officer early Saturday morning has died.

Ricco Chanthapho, 28, died late on Monday, Rochester Police Chief Paul Toussaint said today.

Chanthapho was found to have suffered what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound when police came upon him in the woods around 8:45 a.m. He was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital with what were described as serious injuries. He had been listed in critical condition early in the day on Monday.

Chanthapho had been facing charges of attempted murder, attempted first degree assault, reckless conduct, receiving stolen property and other charges.

The standoff unfolded around 1:50 a.m. after a Rochester Police officer attempted a traffic stop of a blue Volkswagen Jetta near the Lilac Mall on Milton Road. Police say the driver refused to stop and continued north a couple of miles on Milton Road before turning onto Periwinkle Drive where the driver got out and fled into the woods at the rear of Saks Mobile Home Park.

The officer was then fired upon as he began to chase the suspect, who later crossed the Salmon Falls River from the rear of Saks onto the Maine side, which is part of New Hampshire for a short distance along this stretch of the river.

After the initial confrontation officers established a perimeter and began to tighten it throughout the early morning hours before detonating flash bang devices in an effort to flush the suspect out. Chanthapho was unresponsive with what appeared a self-inflicted gunshot wound when police found him.
