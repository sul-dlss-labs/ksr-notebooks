CAMDEN â€” A man wielding a knife at police was shot to death in a city home, Camden County Prosecutor Warren Faulk said Wednesday.



Albert Lane, 33, of the 1800 block of Davis Street was shot multiple times by police as he approached them with a serrated, approximately 8-inch long knife, a spokesman for Faulk said. Lane died at the scene.



Camden Police officers responded to a home on the 1800 block of Browning Road about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday after a 9-1-1 call from Lane's mother reporting he had not been taking his medication for a mental health condition and was acting threateningly with a weapon. A three-man tactical team bearing a protective shield entered with the intention of talking to Lane and convincing him to go with an ambulance waiting outside the home, the spokesman said.



As the team ascended stairs to the second floor Lane came out of a second-story bedroom wielding the knife. Officers ordered Lane to drop the knife but he kept approaching in a threatening manner and two of the officers fired.



An investigation is being conducted by the Camden Police Department and the Prosecutor's Office into the circumstances surrounding the incident. All three officers are currently on administrative leave, a standard procedure whenever an officer is involved in a fatal shooting.
