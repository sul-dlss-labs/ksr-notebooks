Authorities in Eufaula are investigating the circumstances surrounding the early morning death of a city fire medic.

Barbour County Coroner Chip Chapman said Eric Hudson was pronounced dead shortly before 6 a.m. Monday. He said Hudson died from gunshot wounds sustained at the Eufaula Fire Department's downtown central station.

Chapman said police had chased Hudson around Eufaula after he began destroying property and allegedly fired gunshots at or near the fire chief's residence and at a fire station.

The pursuit ended when Hudson rammed his pickup truck into the bay doors at the central station fire house and shots rang out.

It's unclear if Hudson's wounds were self-inflicted or were fired by a police officer.

The Alabama Bureau of Investigation, Eufaula police and the Barbour County district attorney's office are investigating.
