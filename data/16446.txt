The man who was fatally shot by a Doña Ana County Sheriff’s detective Wednesday has been identified as 34-year-old Michael Malone.

The detective, assisted by members of the sheriff’s Special Response Team (SRT), was attempting to serve an arrest warrant on Malone, who was known to be armed and dangerous.

Malone had been wanted on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, felon in possession of a firearm, and battery against a household member. The allegations stem from an ongoing domestic violence investigation headed by the sheriff’s department.

After he was located Wednesday at the Day’s End Motel on Valley Drive in Las Cruces, Malone allegedly attempted to run from sheriff’s department SRT deputies through a window of the motel room.

Additional members of the SRT were positioned outside the motel near the window. After a brief confrontation with Malone, he was shot and killed.

Deputies and detectives on scene administered first aid to Malone until fire and ambulance personnel arrived, but he was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.

The detective who was involved in the shooting will be placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard policy of the department.

An investigation of the Officer-Involved Shooting Task Force has been launched. The task force is a multi-agency unit that includes members of New Mexico State Police, Las Cruces Police Department, New Mexico State University Police, and the Third Judicial District Attorney’s Office. The Doña Ana County Sheriff’s Department is the lead investigative agency in the incident.
