Officers who shot and killed a suspect who went on a shooting spree throughout Placer County last year were justified in using deadly force, the Roseville Police Department said Friday.The department also released dashcam video on Friday of the officer-involved shooting that happened on Jan. 15, 2019, near the Interstate 80 and Highway 65 interchange.Stanley Stepanski III, 48, of Montana, was killed by officers in a gun battle after a shooting spree spanning from Penryn to Loomis and then Roseville, investigations said “We’re releasing the video now because the reviews have been completed and all of the investigative agencies have determined this use of force was within law and policy,” said Roseville police Capt. Josh Simon in the video. “This use-of-force incident deemed justifiable because the involved officers reasonably believed, based on the totality of the circumstances, that deadly force was necessary to defend against an imminent threat.”The dashcam video from a Roseville police patrol car shows an officer pulling up to a scene, where other law enforcement officers were keeping an eye on Stepanski, whose car went off the road along an offramp.The video then shows Stepanski come out of the car. Simon said Stepanski was holding a gun and pointing it at the officers. The video then shows the officers shooting several rounds at Stepanski. A K-9 is seen running at Stepanski. Simon said six officers fired their guns at Stepanski, who later died.The K-9, named Eros, was injured in the shooting and survived.During Stepanski’s shooting spree, 93-year-old Mary Toste was shot and killed in her Penryn home, officials said. A second person was hit by gunfire while he was driving in Loomis. He was taken to the hospital and survived. A third person was shot at in Loomis but was not struck.After the gun battle, officers recovered the handgun Stepanski used in the shooting spree. Simon said forensic evidence confirmed it was the gun used in a crime spree leading up to the officer-involved shooting.
