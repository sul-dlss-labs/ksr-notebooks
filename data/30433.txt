A police officer died after a car dragged him during a traffic stop in Georgia, authorities said Thursday.

The driver of the vehicle, Ansy Dolce, 29, of Cherokee County, was shot and killed by an officer in the incident, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said. The vehicle was pulled over for speeding about 11 p.m. ET Wednesday in Holly Springs, about 40 miles north of Atlanta.

At some point during the stop, Dolce dragged Officer Joe Burson down the road. Burson, 25, fired shots during the incident, but it is unclear what led to the suspect driving off or how Dolce was able to drag Burson.

Holly Springs Chief Tom Keheley called Burson a "genuinely good" person who will be missed among the department. Burson's cause of death is unknown at this time.

"He was a model officer," Keheley said. "If you had the ability to clone police officers, you would have wanted your officer to be Joe Burson."

Burson was sworn in as an officer in March last year after graduating from the academy, according to the department's Facebook page. Keheley said he was able to speak to Burson's widow prior to speaking to reporters on Thursday.

A shift supervisor was with Burson during the traffic stop and other officers who were nearby the scene were able to respond quickly. Investigators will review video of the stop, including from Burson's body camera.

"There were a number of officers on scene," Keheley said. "Most all, if not all, had body cameras. It would depend on the time they arrived as to how much valuable footage there is. And yes, there was car camera footage as well."

Officials did not provide additional details about the investigation, which the Georgia Bureau of Investigation will take part in at the request of the Holly Springs department.
