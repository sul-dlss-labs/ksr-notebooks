A passenger was killed in a crash after an alleged drunk driver rear-ended a stopped police vehicle on the H-1 freeway in Honolulu late Thursday.

The crash occurred on the eastbound lanes prior to the Queen Emma Street overpass at about 11:55 p.m.

Police said a vehicle operated by a 23-year-old woman was traveling east in a black 2019 Nissan Rogue at a high rate of speed with two passengers.

A blue-and-white police vehicle had stopped with its emergency lights flashing on the slow lane to assist a stalled motorist when it was rear-ended by the driver, according to police.

The police officer was not injured and was standing outside the vehicle at the time.

Police said the woman’s vehicle continued on and crashed into a center median.

One of her passengers, a 33-year-old woman, was taken in critical condition to a hospital. An unidentified male passenger in his 30s was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Emergency Medical Services.

Police said speed and alcohol were factors in the crash.

Police arrested the driver on suspicion of first-degree negligent homicide and operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant.

This is the 30th traffic-related fatality on Oahu this year compared to 31 at the same time last year.

In the aftermath of Thursday’s deadly crash, Capt. James Slayter of the Traffic Division said, “In today’s day and age there is no excuse to get behind the wheel of a vehicle while impaired. There are so many other options available that can help you arrive alive at whatever destination you choose. Sadly there are still irresponsible people who drive impaired and risk the lives of other innocent people,” Slayter said.

“These senseless and avoidable tragedies will negatively affect everyone involved and their families. No matter what your mode of transportation is, please remember to be responsible and look out for one another,” he added.
