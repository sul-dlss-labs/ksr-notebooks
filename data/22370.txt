SOUTH BEND | The St. Joseph County prosecutor says two South Bend police officers were justified when they fired 16 shots, killing a bank robbery suspect who lunged at them with a knife.

Prosecutor Michael Dvorak says officers Joshua Morgan and Chris Slager were 6 to 10 feet away from 29-year-old Brian Szuflita of LaPorte on July 25 when they ordered him to drop the knife.

Police say Szuflita had just robbed the 1st Source Bank on the city's north side and was fleeing when he turned toward Morgan with the knife.

Szuflita was a suspect in several other bank robberies in Valparaiso and Chesterton.

Bank tellers at First National Bank on John Howell Drive in Valparaiso confirmed Szuflita was the same man who robbed them in a series of four robberies that occurred in 2007.

Tellers at 1st Source Bank on Indian Boundary Road in Chesterton said Szuflita robbed them on April 7 and other tellers at LaPorte Savings Bank, also on Indian Boundary Road in Chesterton, said he robbed them July 1.

Chesterton police called Szuflita a "very probably suspect" in the July 9 robbery at a Walgreens there as well.
