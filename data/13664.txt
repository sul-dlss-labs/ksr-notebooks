A man was shot to death by police after allegedly attacking a woman and stabbing her more than 30 times in a domestic violence incident near Highway 12 in Fairfield on Tuesday morning, a police sergeant said.Police received a disturbance call from an apartment complex in the 200 block of Pennsylvania Avenue, several blocks from Highway 12, at 9:34 a.m., said Sgt. Matt Bloesch, of the Fairfield Police Department.Officers arrived to find a female stabbing victim. While treating the woman, the officers took down suspect information, Bloesch said.Other officers searched the surrounding area and found the suspect, who took off running onto Highway 12, he said.Police tried to subdue the man with less-lethal weapons but were unsuccessful, Bloesch said. The suspect then attempted to attack officers with a knife, and at least one officer shot him.The suspect, 24-year-old Deonte Traylor of Fairfield, was airlifted to a hospital and later pronounced dead, Bloesch said.Traylor was on parole for robbery and has a long criminal history, he said.The victim was also airlifted to a hospital and remains in critical condition at a trauma center. Her name has not been released.Bloesch said the suspect and victim knew each other but did not disclose the nature of their relationship.Both directions of Highway 12 were closed for several hours between Pennsylvania and Beck avenues during the initial investigation.The officers involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative leave, Bloesch said.Solano Coroner's Office said Wednesday that Traylor's autopsy will be performed Thursday or Friday.Traylor was released from San Quentin last March after serving a five-year sentence for a 2008 robbery in Yolo County, state correctional officers said.
