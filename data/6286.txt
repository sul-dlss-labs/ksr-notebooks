Natchitoches Parish Deputies and Natchitoches Police invovled in the shooting death of a Texas man last year were justified in using deadly force.

That's the decision from Natchitoches Parish District Attorney Van Kyzar.

On June 27, 2007, Red River Parish Deputies began chasing 19-year-old Joshua Kyle. The chase eventually entered Natchitoches Parish.

Kyzar said Kyle tried to hit oncoming cars during the pursuit. He was stopped when deputies flattened his tires with spike strips. However, Kyzar said Kyle would not get out of his car and he was armed with a shotgun. As he attempted to drive off, he tried to hit an officer before ramming a police car. That's when officers and deputies began shooting.

Kyzar said he reviewed the investigation done by the Louisiana State Police, and that the officers and deputies actions were justified.
