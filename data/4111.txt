HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) — Two people were killed and two injured in separate collisions when a vehicle fleeing police drove onto Interstate 565 in the wrong direction.

The police chase Friday night began during suspected drug activity involving a 2005 Lincoln. Officers ended the chase in heavy traffic as the Lincoln going the wrong way on the interstate collided head-on with a GMC Yukon, injuring the driver of the SUV.

A passenger in the Lincoln, Eric Hereford, 23, of Huntsville, was killed, police said. The driver of the Lincoln, Cedric Lipscomb, 23, also of Huntsville, was critically injured and taken to Huntsville Hospital.

Police said Lipscomb will face manslaughter charges when released.

In a related accident, Dr. Madeleine Youmans, an assistant professor of linguistics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, died Saturday from injuries she received when her vehicle was struck by another vehicle about 9:30 p.m. Friday.

Police said Youmans' vehicle was stopped in traffic delayed by the head-on collision. Her car was rear-ended by another vehicle, police said.
