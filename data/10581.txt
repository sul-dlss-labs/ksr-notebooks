TUCKERTON — An unidentified 35-year-old man in Ocean County was shot and killed by police responding to a domestic incident, officials said.

According to a preliminary investigation, Tuckerton officers "were accosted by an individual with a weapon and he was shot multiple times," said Deputy Chief of Investigations Michael Mohel, deputy chief of investigations of the county prosecutor’s office.

Mohel would not comment on the type of weapon held by the man.

The man was pronounced dead at 9:09 p.m. at a residence on the 200 block of Otis Avenue in Tuckerton, he said.

He lived at the residence with the woman who called police, Mohel said.

Two officers went to the home after a woman called about 8:30 p.m. to report a domestic dispute, Mohel said. Which officer fired the shots and how many shots were fired are under investigation, he said.

Both officers were taken to a local hospital for evaluation, he said.

As in all police-involved shootings, the investigation results will be sent to the state Attorney General’s office, he said.

This is at least the second fatal police-involved shooting this year in Ocean County, said Mohel.
