SOUTHWEST SIDE â€” Police were investigating the death of an Oak Lawn man who collapsed and died after a struggle with on-and off-duty Chicago police officers who had been summoned to a Southwest Side bank.

Daniel Austin, 44, of Oak Lawn, entered the Bank One branch in the 6200 block of South Western Avenue and spoke with a customer-service person about 3:40 p.m. Tuesday, said Sgt. Cynthia Lance of Chicago police news affairs. When the employee asked him questions, Austin allegedly became loud and combative. Austin pushed the employee, who summoned the security guard, an off-duty Chicago police officer. Lance said the guard asked Austin to leave the bank and, when he refused, the guard attempted to escort him out of the building; Austin allegedly became combative again, Lance said. As Austin was being escorted from the bank, he became unresponsive, Lance said.
