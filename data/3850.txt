A woman who led police on a chase through three counties before a crash that killed another motorist was sentenced Friday to 15 years in prison.

Lara M. Strack, 25, of Random Lake pleaded guilty to second-degree reckless homicide and fleeing officers in the chase in December, which hit speeds up to 100 mph.

The chase began as Strack was fleeing from officers seeking to arrest her on allegations of forgery.

It led through Washington, Ozaukee and Milwaukee counties before the crash that killed Benjamin Fagan, 82, of Whitefish Bay.

Defense lawyer Douglas Bihler asked for a three-year prison term, but Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Elsa Lamelas sentenced Strack to the 15-year term, plus five years of extended supervision.

"It would be impossible to determine how many people Ms. Strack endangered by the recklessness of her conduct," Lamelas said.

She also ordered that Strack pay Fagan's widow more than $28,000 in restitution for car damage and funeral expenses.
