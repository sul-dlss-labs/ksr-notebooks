Officers who shot and killed a man on Chapman Crest Drive in Campbell County last month acted with appropriate restraint and compassion, according to Eighth Judicial District Attorney General Jared Effler.

General Effler determined the officers were objectively reasonable and completely justified under the extremely dangerous, volatile, and unfortunate circumstances they encountered.

The officers tried to disengage Lloyd Michael Heatherly, who investigators said was pacing the yard and urging officers to shoot at him, before he pointed his gun at officers and they started shooting.

"After the initial shots, he continued to reach for his weapon and shots were fired again. Lloyd Michael Heatherly died as a result of the gunshot wounds he sustained," a release from the DA's office said.

His wife, 54-year-old Rose Heatherly, was found shot and killed in their home in a neighborhood off Old Middlesboro Highway in LaFollette on July 25, 2018.

In the 911 call Lloyd made at around 3 p.m. that day, he said “Yes, this is 116 Chapman Crest Drive. I have just shot my wife and I’m fixin’ to shoot myself. Bye," according to the DA's office.

When agencies arrived on scene, authorities said they found him pacing the yard with a gun and he was told to drop it several times before deadly forced was used.
