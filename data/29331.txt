HOUSTON â€” A teenage chase suspect reportedly struck a vehicle, killing an innocent person and injuring another in southeast Houston early Thursday.

The crash happened along Highway 3 at El Dorado, crushing the backend of one of the vehicles involved.

Houston police said they were earlier alerted that a 16-year-old girl had taken her mother's vehicle. Police located the teenager, but she sped up and got away from officers. Officers were told to not continue the pursuit, but a police helicopter was overhead.

The teenager was seen traveling southbound on Highway 3 when she crashed into the back of the victims' sedan at an intersection.

The suspect was taken to the hospital with serious injuries as was the innocent woman who was driving the sedan that was struck. Police said a male passenger in the struck vehicle passed away at the scene.

No names have been released at this time.

Police said officers on the ground had lost sight of the teenager at the time of the crash, and they did not have their emergency lights activated.
