San Antonio police have released the identity of the person shot to death by officers Sunday night.

According to police investigators, Lee Redoux III, 30, was shot and killed on the city's northwest side just after 8 p.m. on Culebra Road near Loop 410 and Gustafson Stadium.

Police said Redoux was wanted in connection with the robbery of the Fairfield Inn in the 4000 block of Wiseman Boulevard shortly before the shooting.

Around 7:30 p.m., police spotted Redoux's vehicle. He fled from officers on Culebra Road near Grissom Road and a chase ensued. During the chase, investigators said Redoux crashed his car into several other cars before fleeing on foot.

During a foot pursuit, investigators said, Redoux attempted to carjack a woman in a van. The officer giving chase was struck by a vehicle during the foot pursuit, but was able to continue.

At some point, the officer and Redoux were engaged in a hand-to-hand struggle.

During that struggle, the officer pulled his weapon and shot Redoux, killing him.
