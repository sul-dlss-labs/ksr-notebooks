A man shot and killed by a Huntington Beach police officer had pulled out what appeared to be a gun when confronted by police, authorities said.

Police were called about 4:30 p.m. Thursday to the 4900 block of Warner Avenue with a report of a man and woman arguing behind an Italian restaurant, said Lt. Mitchell O’Brien of the Huntington Beach Police Department.

The man was identified by authorities Friday as 20-year-old Ian Christopher Berrier.

The caller, according to O’Brien, told authorities the man claimed to have a handgun and was making threats, the Huntington Beach Independent reported.

When police arrived, the couple was seen walking through a nearby housing tract. O’Brien said an officer opened fire after he confronted the man, who pulled out what was later determined to be a ‘replica semiautomatic pistol.’

Berrier died at the scene. The woman was uninjured and in police custody.

The officer, whose identity was not released by authorities, was uninjured.
