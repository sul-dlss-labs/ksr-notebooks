The other suspect, Claude Muller, 28, was arrested at Bellevue Hospital Center in Manhattan, where he had sought treatment for three bullet wounds in his leg, the police said. Charges were pending last night.

The confrontation began around 6 p.m. after Mr. Burno and Mr. Muller set off the theft alarm on their way into the store, said Assistant Chief Joseph Esposito, the Brooklyn borough commander.

At that point, Chief Esposito said, Officer Ollivierre and another employee confronted the men, and gunfire was exchanged. A store manager, Gamal Hassan, said that there were about six customers in the store, and that they and the other employees all dove to the floor. The vestibule, where the shots were apparently exchanged at close range, was littered with spent shells from two guns, said Lt. Cory Cuneo, another police spokesman. It was not clear who fired first, but about a dozen shots were fired, Chief Esposito said. Officer Ollivierre, 29, had not been involved in any previous shootings, the police said.

One police official said that the two suspects might have been working a shoplifting scheme in which a thief carries a device into the store that sets off the alarm. After the alarm sounds, store employees see that the suspect has no merchandise, so that when the alarm sounds again as the suspect leaves, employees are tricked into not searching him.

Mr. Burno's weapon was not recovered, but at least one witness told the police that Mr. Muller fell to the ground, snatched the wounded youth's pistol and ran to a blue Lincoln driven by another man, and sped away.
