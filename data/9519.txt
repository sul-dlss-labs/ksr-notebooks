FULLERTON – An 18-year-old woman has been charged with carrying out an armed robbery with her older sister, who shot herself in the head after police pulled over the car they were riding in, authorities said.

Kimiko Gomi of Huntington Beach is facing one felony count of second degree robbery with an enhancement for being armed with a firearm, one felony count of kidnapping and one felony count of second degree burglary. She is scheduled to be arraigned on Oct. 15, court records show.

Gomi was with her older sister, Calen Kawakami, 22, of Fullerton, when they carried out the armed robbery about 5 p.m. Sunday at Sophie’s Dog Shop and Barkery at 915 Starbuck, at the Amerige Heights Town Center, said Sgt. Andrew Goodrich of the Fullerton police.

Kawakami brandished a handgun and demanded cash from the cash register, Goodrich said.

Following the robbery, Gomi and her sister ran out of the store with an unknown amount of cash, pointed a handgun at a man who was driving through the parking lot and forced him to drive them away from the shopping center, Goodrich said.

The sisters had arrived at the shopping center in a car, “but it looks like they felt they didn’t have time to get to it and that’s why they decided to carjack the victim,” Goodrich said.

Gomi got in the back seat of the victim’s car. Kawakami, who was armed with a 9mm semi-automatic pistol, got in the front seat, Goodrich said.

Officers responded to reports of a robbery at the shop and pulled over a red Mercedes-Benz on Gilbert Street, south of Rosecrans Avenue, Goodrich said. Because of the recent robbery, officers did not approach the Mercedes. Instead, they asked the occupants to get out of the car with their hands up.

That’s when police heard the gunshot, Goodrich said.

The 64-year-old driver immediately jumped out of the car while Gomi stayed in the back seat.

Kawakami was taken to a nearby trauma center, where she died, he said.

“It’s unknown if it was a snap decision or if she had thought about it,” Goodrich said about Kawakami shooting herself in the head.

Gomi was arrested and is being held at the Orange County Jail.

Goodrich said it appears Sunday’s robbery was the first the sisters carried out. Kawakami purchased the handgun within days of the robbery.

“We believe that based upon the available information that this robbery was an isolated incident, and there are no other unsolved robberies involving these suspects,” Goodrich said.

Kawakami apparently had other run-ins with the law.

According to court records, a woman with the same name and date of birth:

In 2007 pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of petty theft. She was sentenced to five days in jail and three years probation.

In 2010 pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of theft with a prior conviction and was sentenced to 30 days in jail and three years probation.

Kawakami was laid to rest Thursday morning. Family and friends gathered at her parents’ home to remember the young woman.

“None of us saw it coming,” said her mother, Margarita Kawakami. “She was a very nice, friendly girl. I have no words for it. No one expected it.”
