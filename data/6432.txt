As police were arriving, Delgado came out, holding a woman at gunpoint. That woman broke free and went back inside the bank. Delgado pointed her gun at officers. Officers Walter Boyle, 42, and Felipe Martinez, 25, both fired. Delgado was struck multiple times. Her gun turned out to be a plastic semi-automatic replica.
