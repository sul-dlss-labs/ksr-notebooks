A Brooklyn man was fatally shot and another man critically wounded in a fierce gunfight with plainclothes police officers early yesterday outside a Brooklyn social club, the police said. After the shooting, the men led the police on a car chase down a street in East New York, leaving smashed automobiles, crushed glass and anxious residents along the way.

Many details of the confrontation, which occurred about 4 a.m., were unclear last night, but investigators said a preliminary investigation suggested that the officers had been fired upon. Relatives of the dead man disputed that and said he had raised his arms to surrender at the time he was shot.

Evidence of the gun battle and the pursuit was strewn over 10 blocks of New Lots Avenue. Yellow evidence markers littered the ground on the block where the confrontation began. Where it ended, in front of a storefront Baptist church, sat a crushed black BMW sedan -- the car that the police say the men drove until it smashed into a steel gate.

The dead man, Darryl Green, 21, died of a bullet that had entered his body under his armpit, his relatives said they were told by physicians who had treated him.
