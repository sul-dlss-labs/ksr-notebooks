OMAHA â€” The Douglas County sheriff's office is struggling with a loss of manpower after two fatal encounters over the past week in Omaha.

Sheriff Tim Dunning told KMTV-TV that seven deputies who serve arrest warrants have been put on paid leave, so members of the department's K9 unit will have to help cover their shifts. That means overtime, which Dunning said should put him over budget.

"We're at the end of budget season and we thought we were going to survive," he said. "Now with all the additional overtime that is going to occur, we're not sure if we're going to make that."

A deputy was shot Wednesday as he tried to serve a warrant south of downtown Omaha. Another deputy was bitten by a police dog who was confused during the melee. The suspect, 37-year-old David Cermak, was shot to death by deputies.

On Friday, four deputies were injured trying to serve warrants on a south Omaha man who later died at a hospital. Dunning has said 34-year-old Bradley Hartz was not shot but likely died of a drug-related heart attack. He said Hartz showed signs of "excited delirium," which is sometimes associated with drug use and creates aggressive behavior, paranoia and unexpected physical strength.

One deputy was bitten on his right thigh by Hartz in Friday's incident, another was hit in the head and may have suffered a concussion and a third suffered a broken wrist, the sheriff has said. The fourth deputy suffered wrist and hand injuries.

The Omaha police department is investigating both incidents. Deputies are generally placed on paid administrative leave in cases in which a suspect dies.

Dunning said the loss in manpower will not affect public safety but it may slow warrant service. He said he hopes to have some of the deputies cleared to return to work in the coming week.
