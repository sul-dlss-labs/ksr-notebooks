SAN ANTONIO â€“ A San Antonio police officer on Thursday afternoon shot and killed a man who was holding a woman against her will, police Chief William McManus said.

McManus said officers kicked down a door at an apartment complex in the 200 block of Rainbow Drive when the man pointed a rifle at the officers. An officer shot the man twice, McManus said. The suspect, who was in his 40s, was transported to a hospital, where he died upon arrival.

The 21-year-old woman, who was taken to a hospital with head injuries, called her mother and said she had been held against her will by the man for several days, McManus said. The mother then called police.

The officer who shot the man will be placed on routine administrative duty pending an investigation, McManus said. The officer is a seven-year veteran of the force.
