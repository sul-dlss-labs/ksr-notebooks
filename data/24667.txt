A sister and mother are speaking out after a stand-off at the Depot apartments in Waco early Friday morning where a man was found dead.

Police said the man died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Antonio Avila's sister and mother both say they spoke with him the night he died.

His mother Linda Day said she was on the phone with her son when she heard him speaking with a man.

“There is a guy in the parking lot with a baseball bat and he got out of the car and said to the man ‘Are you playing baseball at 1:46 in the morning sir?’ and the guy said ‘no I'm gonna bash your head in with this baseball bat’,” Day said.

Day claims her son then told her he was not safe.

"My son said, 'mom, this guy is coming at me I’ll let you go and get in my house where I'm safe and that is the last time I spoke to my son alive," Day said.

Day is claiming that is when an altercation began.

It was three hours later when the family claims to have heard from Avila again. His sister Rebecca Avila said he called her crying around 4 a.m. giving her his last words.

“"It's not your fault and I love you it's nobody's fault and nobody can do anything and nobody can help me because I'm afraid I don't belong here. So I love you that was it," Avila said.

Neither Day nor Avila knows what happened between those two calls.

Around that time is when Waco police said they got multiple calls of a suicidal man firing a handgun at people.

When officers arrived they said Avila went back inside his apartment and a swat team showed up and tried to make contact with him but had no success.

It wasn't until after 7 a.m. that police called Day telling her that her son was dead.

Waco police didn't say if there was a fight before they were called.

Now the family is left wondering why and hoping police will find an answer.
