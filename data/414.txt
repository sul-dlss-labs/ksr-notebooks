The two deputies from the Lancaster station were called to a home in the 44200 block of Kingtree Avenue shortly before 8 p.m. by the couple’s daughter, who said her father was stabbing her mother.

When deputies arrived, Escobar allegedly swung at one of them with the machete. The other deputy shot Escobar.

Escobar’s wife is expected to recover from wounds she suffered fending off the machete, authorities said. Detectives from the sheriff’s homicide unit are investigating the incident.
