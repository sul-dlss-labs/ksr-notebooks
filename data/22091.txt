MARIETTA, Okla. (KXII) -- A chase through Love County this past weekend ended with a man shot and killed by law enforcement officers.

Kellen J. Kyle of Ardmore, 22, was shot and killed by law enforcement early Monday morning.

Oklahoma Highway Patrol Troopers said just after midnight Sunday, they got a call that a naked, intoxicated man was filming and swearing in front of kids at Marietta Landing on Lake Murray.

Kyle was wearing shorts, and was not naked, when he was encountered by law enforcement, troopers said.

When authorities arrived, Kyle took off down Scenic 77 in a maroon SUV.

The Love County Sheriff's office put out stop sticks, which the SUV ran over.

Roddy Childers lives down the road.

"This is pretty crazy," Childers said on Monday. "We usually hear everything that goes on around the community and I haven't heard anything."

Lake Patrol and the Love County Sheriff's Office assisted Oklahoma Highway Patrol.

The standoff ended when, troopers said, Kyle got out of the vehicle in the middle of the highway just north of State Highway 32 armed with a shotgun.

Several officers opened fire, killing him.

"There might be a fight or people down at the lake drinking getting into a little scuffle," Childers said. "But nothing really major. This is the worst I have heard of."
