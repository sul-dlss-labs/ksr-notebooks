A 39-year-old man died after he fought with four companions in a Suffolk County house on Friday, and then struggled so violently with the police that a Taser stun gun was used to try to subdue him, the authorities said yesterday.

The Suffolk County police said John Cox, whose residence was unknown, rushed at arresting officers who were called about 8 p.m. to a house at 601 Taylor Avenue in North Bellport. Responding to a complaint that an intoxicated man was "breaking up the house," the police said, they confronted Mr. Cox, who was "bare chested and yelling."

"Cox then rushed toward the officers and a Taser was employed with no effect," said a statement released by the Suffolk County police. Before the struggle ended, with Mr. Cox taken by ambulance to Brookhaven Memorial Hospital, nine officers sustained injuries ranging from a bite wound to a broken wrist, the statement said. Mr. Cox died later at the hospital, the police said. The results of an autopsy, which was scheduled for today, were not disclosed last night.

Mr. Cox had a history of erratic behavior, according to Lucille Harris, 71, who owns the house where the disturbance took place. She said she was home at the time, and Mr. Cox had shown up hoping to see her daughter, Georgia. It was unclear who was involved in the dispute before the police arrived.
