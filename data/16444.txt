The scene of Wednesday night's standoff in Logan at 300 North 200 East.

LOGAN — A 53-year-old Logan man was shot and killed Wednesday night outside his home during a standoff with police and SWAT teams.

Logan City Police Chief Gary Jensen said officers were called to the home at 346 North 200 East around 8:30 p.m. after Roger Darrin Barker claimed he was going to shoot himself. SWAT teams and negotiators were later called to the area and set up a perimeter around the home.

Around 11:45 p.m. Barker stood on his front porch and shot at police with a handgun, striking an officer’s patrol car. Another officer and a Cache County Sheriff’s deputy returned fire, striking Barker and knocking him down.

Jensen said paramedics were immediately summoned and transported Barker to Logan Regional Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Both the officer and deputy have been placed on administrative leave. The Davis County Sheriff’s Department and Davis County Attorney’s Office has been requested to investigate the shooting.

No one else was reportedly injured. Earlier in the night, police had initiated an automated phone system to call local neighbors asking them to remain in their homes.

Barker reportedly threatened negotiators several times during the standoff, saying he wanted to see how many people were going to die.
