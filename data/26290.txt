BROOKLYN, Ohio -- An armed man experiencing a medical crisis died early Tuesday in an officer-involved shooting at a Brooklyn apartment building, police said.

Brooklyn police Chief Scott Mielke did not specify in a news release whether an officer fatally shot the man. The man fired a single gunshot before an officer fired a shot, Mielke said.

The man suffered a gunshot wound to the head and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the news release and police dispatch records. Authorities have not released his name.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating the officer-involved shooting, Mielke said.

The fatal shooting happened about 11 p.m. at the Parkview Estates on Memphis Avenue near Tiedeman Road, Mielke said.

Brooklyn police officers went to the apartment building for a report of a man yelling in the lobby of the apartment building and holding a gun. Crisis Intervention Trained officer found the man and negotiated with him.

The man went back into an apartment, and officers tried to evacuate the rest of the tenants on the same floor, police said.

Crisis negotiators from the Southwest Enforcement Bureau were also called in to assist at the scene.

The man raised his gun about 1:30 a.m. and fired one shot, according to police dispatch records. An officer also fired one shot, Mielke said.

The dispatch records do not specify whether the officer shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mielke directed any questions to the BCI and said his department would not be releasing any more information Tuesday.
