MOSS POINT, MS (WLOX) - A man is dead after a Moss Point police officer shot him near the intersection of Interstate 10 and Highway 63 in Moss Point. Police Chief Keith Davis said one of his officers responded to a call around 9:30 Sunday night stating that a man was "exhibiting bizarre behavior."

Jackson County coroner Vicki Broadus says the man killed was 29-year-old Emanuel Jean Baptiste.

"On arrival, our officers encountered this individual and during that encounter our officer unfortunately had to use deadly force," Davis said.

Davis said the suspect was taken to Singing River Hospital where he died from his injuries.

The Mississippi Department of Investigations has an investigation underway to make sure the shooting was justified.

While every police department has its own rules when it comes to the use of deadly force, all departments generally follow similar operating procedures that allow for deadly force if the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others.

"If an officer is involved in a shooting of any type we would call an independent agency to investigate it for us, and I chose to call Mississippi Bureau of Investigations," Davis said.

The officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of MBI's investigation. This is the Moss Point Police Department's protocol for any shooting involving an officer.

"Anytime you have a situation of this magnitude it is always tough," Davis said. "There is a family involved and our officer and his family are involved, so I'm calling on the community's support and prayers for both families. We will get through this, but it is certainly hard on the police officer at this time."

Since the investigation is ongoing, no other details about the shooting, including the names of the man who died or the police officer, are being released.
