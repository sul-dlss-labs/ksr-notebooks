Oklahoma City Police have identified a suspect who was shot and killed after a confrontation with an officer Friday afternoon.

According to authorities, 42-year-old Miguel Angel Chavez-Angles, was wanted for vandalism at NW 11th and Walker. Police say he forced his way into a car with two women inside. Officers say he made them drive off but later got out of the car at NW 23rd and Classen. Officers say Chavez eventually ran onto a city bus where he was confronted by an Oklahoma City Police officer, Heather Lane.

Police say Chavez reached for officer Lane's gun and the two got into a physical struggle for Lane's weapon. Officer Daniel Carli came to her aid firing his gun, killing Chavez.

No one else was injured in the incident.

The officers involved have been placed on administrative leaving pending the investigation.
