A 65-year-old man has been identified as the suspect fatally shot by Hanceville police on Sunday.

Police Chief Bob Long identified the man as Robert Wilsford Sr. “Yesterday was a terrible time for the Hanceville Police Department and the City of Hanceville,’’ the chief said in a prepared statement posted to the department’s Facebook page accompanied by photos of bullet holes to a Hanceville police car.

The shooting took place at a residence outside the Hanceville city limits, but within the Hanceville Police Department’s jurisdiction in Cullman County. The chief said officers responded to the home on County Road 599 to perform a welfare check on Wilsford after a concerned family member called worried about his well-being.

Shortly after officers arrived on the scene, Long said, they were met with gunfire from an individual at the residence, which struck the officers patrol car several times. "Shots were exchanged between officers and the suspect at the residence, which resulted in the suspect being shot multiple times,’’ he said. No officers were injured in the exchange of gunfire.

Wilsford was taken to Cullman Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead on arrival. Court records do not indicate any prior criminal history for Wilsford.

“Our thoughts and prayers are with all involved, as well as their families,” Long said.

The State Bureau of Investigation is leading the probe, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.
