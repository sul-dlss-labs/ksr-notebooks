CHICKASHA, Okla. — Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents are investigating a deadly shooting in Chickasha.

OSBI says that Chickasha police requested an investigation into the shooting at around 7:30 p.m., about 30 minutes after the shooting.

They say that Chickasha police received a call about a burglary in the 1200 block of S. 16 Street.

While on the way to the scene, officers spotted two men walking in 1200 block of W. Florida Ave.

Authorities say one of the men ran from police.

Eventually, officers say they found 26-year-old Andrew Jackson inside a nearby home.

When two Grady County deputies and a Chickasha police officer went inside, they say Jackson pulled out a knife.

OSBI says that officers told him ‘numerous times’ to drop the knife, but Jackson refused.

An officer then shot Jackson, killing him.

Once they’ve completed their investigation, a report will be given to the district attorney, who will decide whether the shooting was justified.
