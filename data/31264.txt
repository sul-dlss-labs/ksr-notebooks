A suspect who was wanted for an outstanding parole warrant and an assault with a deadly weapons charge was fatally shot in West Covina Monday by a U.S. Marshals’ task force during an attempted arrest, authorities reported.

The shooting happened around 12:30 p.m. in the 700 block of North Sunset Avenue, the U.S. Marshals Service said in a news release. Video from the scene showed yellow crime scene tape surrounding the Sunset Square Apartment Complex.

“As the officers observed the suspect inside a vehicle in the rear parking lot of the location, he exited and attempted to flee on foot. As the officers attempted to detain the suspect, he produced a firearm and an officer involved shooting occurred,” the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement.

The suspect, whose name was not released, was struck multiple times in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene.

A firearm was recovered at the scene.

The Sheriff’s Department said the involved officer is a West Covina Police Officer assigned to the U.S. Marshals Pacific Southwest Regional Fugitive Task Force.

No law enforcement officers were injured in the shooting.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department is the lead agency investigating the shooting. Detectives are canvassing the area of the shooting in search of surveillance video.

The U.S. Marshals Service will also conduct an internal review after the county investigation is complete, officials said.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.
