About 300 friends and family gathered at a southwest suburban graveside Thursday to lay to rest one of the young men killed last week when authorities say a drunken off-duty Chicago police detective slammed into their car on the Dan Ryan Expressway.

Sobbing quietly and hugging one another at Resurrection Cemetery in Justice, friends of Andrew Cazares, 23, talked about a life cut short. They recalled his artistic talent, love of skateboarding, and called for justice.

"We want to let them know we're not backing down," said Cazares' former roommate, Chris Hummel, 23, of Chicago. "You can't sweep it under the rug."

Cazares and friend Fausto Manzera, 21, had pulled over April 10 to deal with a flat tire when their car was hit from behind by Detective Joseph Frugoli's vehicle, authorities said. He has been charged with reckless homicide, aggravated DUI and leaving the scene of a fatal crash.

Gustavo Medina, 22, of Summit, a close friend of Cazares, also lost his cousin in a similar incident on Thanksgiving 2007. Two Cicero men, including Medina's cousin, Erick Lagunas, were killed in a collision involving a Chicago police officer accused of being drunk behind the wheel. John Ardelean, still faces reckless homicide and aggravated DUI charges.

Medina said Cazares went to barbecues at his cousin's home. He said he was angry when he heard about Cazares' death because circumstances sounded all too familiar.

Many friends were pallbearers and placed their gloves in the grave. Hummel put his earrings into the grave, and Jazniel Vazquez, 24, of Summit, who skateboarded with Cazares, placed his own board in the grave. He, too, vowed to keep an eye on the court case.
