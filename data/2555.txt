A 22-year-old man who officials said was high on drugs went into cardiac arrest and died in Washington Heights yesterday after police officers subdued him with pepper spray to stop him from attacking his father, the police said.

The man, Jose A. Mateo, was smashing furniture and assaulting his father when four officers responded to a 911 call at 9:10 a.m. at the men's apartment on West 178th Street, the police said.

A woman a law enforcement official identified as Mr. Mateo's girlfriend, Cassandra Hodge, 26, placed the call and can be heard on a 911 tape saying that he was having a ''very bad reaction'' to some drugs he bought on Sunday, and that ''he is violent, he is hallucinating.''

Mr. Mateo began acting strangely shortly before he turned violent yesterday, a law enforcement official said. He bought a mix of cocaine and another drug on Sunday, the official said, and told people on Tuesday that there was something wrong with the drugs. Members of Mr. Mateo's family said he did not have a history of mental or emotional problems, the official added.
