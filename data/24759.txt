A woman was shot by a Colorado State Patrol trooper and a man took his own life following a pursuit involving a stolen Jeep near Alamosa.

The Colorado State trooper who shot and killed a woman armed with a shotgun near Alamosa earlier this year will not be charged, according to a decision letter from the 12th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.

The deadly incident happened on Aug. 25 when the Saguache County Sheriff’s Office tried to pull over a man driving a stolen Jeep Patriot in Moffat, which is about 37 miles north of Alamosa.

The man, identified as 26-year-old Nelson Billings, did not pull over, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said. A pursuit ensued, and during it, the passenger in the car – 37-year-old Jennifer Sharp – told dispatch that “people are going to die” and made similar threats.

During the pursuit, CBI said Sharp brandished a gun. A Colorado State Patrol trooper and Alamosa County deputy also followed the stolen vehicle through several county roads.

The Jeep finally came to a stop after a CSP sergeant put out stop sticks on State Highway 17 near the Saguache/Alamosa county line. According to the decision letter from the DA, the stolen vehicle stopped within mere feet of a pickup with two occupants inside. They were boxed in by a semi-truck.

The DA said their investigation revealed that Sharp got out of the Jeep and ran toward the pickup while brandishing a shotgun.

This prompted a Colorado State trooper to open fire, hitting and killing her. Investigators said Billings picked up Sharp’s shotgun and took his own life.

Both Billing and Sharp were from Texas, according to the DA.
