The chase started Saturday night when Leslie Shawn Crone passed Hawkins Police officers on a routine traffic stop.

Hawkins police Lieutenant A.J. Randall said, "When they finished their traffic stop, they went to the Sonic, and were going to tell the guy that he didn't have any tail lights. When they approached the vehicle, the chase was on. He ran immediately."

They began chasing him, not quite sure why he was running. That would soon become very clear. Saturday night was not the first time that Leslie Shawn Crone had run-ins with law enforcement. He has a criminal background that spans more than 17 pages. For the last 20 years he has faced multiple DWI charges, posession of drugs, and this was not the first time he had tried to evade arrest.

He was already on parole for running from the police. His parole had been revoked and a warrant issued. It said Crone knowingly possessed a controlled substance, namely marijuana. It also said he intentionally and knowingly committed the offense of possession of a firearm by a felon.

Hawkins police learned about the outstanding warrants while they were chasing Crone. After 12 minutes, at speeds higher than 90 miles an hour, Crone took a turn which would ultimately derail them.

He headed down a dark dirt road filled with deep ruts and lined with trees.

"Corporal Randall terminated the pursuit when the guy turned the lights off. We couldn't see him anymore. Rather than risk their own lives, they terminated the pursuit," Lieutenant Randall said.

In the end, it would not be the life of an officer that was at risk, but the life of the man they were trying to capture. On Monday, Crone was pronounced dead at an Oklahoma hospital after he was shot by Kingston Police.
