The Jefferson County Coroner's Office has identified the teenager as Jaylen Derrell Terry, 15, of Bessemer. He was pronounced dead at 12:46 p.m. at UAB Hospital.WVTM 13's Jon Paepcke spoke to the teen's mother about the chase and crash that left her son dead and her husband in jail. Hear what she said in the video above.A 15-year-old died Saturday after a crash during a chase with Jefferson County Sheriff's deputies near Midfield.Around 11:50 a.m., the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Neighborhood Enforcement Team (SNET), was filming with a crew from the Live PD television program when they witnessed a drug transaction at a gas station. Deputies stopped both parties who participated in the transaction and the purchaser confirmed what had taken place. Deputies said as they approached the seller's vehicle, he sped off with two other people in the car.The driver, identified as 41-year-old Reico Derrell Terry of Bessemer, led deputies on a chase throughout the area and onto the interstate. They were not successfull in attempts to block the vehicle and the driver exited onto surface streets. Deputies said the driver was not slowing for intersections and the SNET deputies ended the pursuit, but the driver continued to try to get further from authorities and did not yield to oncoming traffic or stop for traffic lights. At approximately 12:07 p.m., the vehicle collided with an 18-wheeler at the intersection of 8th Avenue West and Arkadelphia Road.Deputies said Terry jumped out of the vehicle and attempted to run from the scene, but they were able to apprehend him and take him into custody. They say they found him in possession of heroin. Terry’s 15-year-old son was riding in the back seat and was taken to the hospital where he died.The passenger in the front seat had minor injuries and was released after questioning. The sheriff's office initially reported that deputies had called off the chase before the crash, but they have since determined that the pursuit was still active at the time of the deadly collision."It was initially thought that Deputies had ended the pursuit with Terry, however, after supervisory review, it was confirmed that Law Enforcement was still trailing the fleeing vehicle," the sheriff's office said on Tuesday.Terry is being held in the Jefferson County Jail on $53,000 bond. He is facing charges including unlawful distribution of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia, felony attempting to elude, reckless endangerment, loitering, tampering with evidence and resisting arrest. Per procedure, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency was called to work the traffic accident. Additional charges from the wreck may be pursued against Terry pending the results of the investigation by ALEA.
