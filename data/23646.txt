Phoenix police shot and killed a man who had been threatening people with a knife at a gas-station convenience store Wednesday night, officials said.

The incident occurred just before 7 p.m., when officers responded to multiple calls coming from different locations in the area of 32nd street and Thomas Road reporting that a man was acting erratically, said Phoenix police Sgt. Jonathan Howard.

Phoenix police arrived at a gas station at the corner of the intersection where a man was reportedly cut by someone carrying a knife, Howard said.

While police were tending to that victim, whose injuries were not life-threatening, a clerk came running out of the store at the gas station and told police the man with the knife was back in the store threatening people, Howard said.

Officers went to the store and were confronted by the man near the front door. Officers shot the man just inside the front door, and he was pronounced dead at the scene, Howard said.

Connie Burciaga was at the scene Wednesday and said she may have encountered the man a short time before he was shot.

A distraught Burciaga said a man with fresh blood on his clothes and cut marks on his arms and obviously upset approached her at a coffee shop in the area earlier Wednesday evening.

Burciaga said she offered to take him to a hospital but he refused.

When Burciaga left the coffee shop, she said the man was in the parking lot crying.

Shortly after, Burciaga said she saw the police cars swarm the nearby gas station and speculated it could have been the same man she had spoken with.

Police still were at the intersection investigating the scene Wednesday night.
