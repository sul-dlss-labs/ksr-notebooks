A high-speed chase across parts of Terrebonne and Lafourche early Wednesday ended after the suspect took his own life, authorities said.

Deputies received a call at 2:25 a.m. about a man threatening to kill himself at a home on West Main Street in Gray, the Terrebonne Parish Sheriff’s Office said. In addition to making suicidal threats, the caller claimed her son was jumping on top of vehicles.

When deputies arrived, they saw two men climb into a Chrysler, which swerved around their patrol car and headed toward the highway at high speed with no headlights on, the Sheriff’s Office said.

The driver, Beau Joseph Rodrigue, 22, refused to pull over and ran a red light and swerved into oncoming traffic, authorities said. State Police and Lafourche Parish sheriff’s deputies also became involved in the chase after it crossed La. 309 and entered Lafourche.

Deputies tried to use a spike strip to stop Rodrigue, but the pursuit continued onto La. 308, authorities said. Several shots were also fired from the fleeing car as it turned into the driveway of a home on La. 308 around 1:05 a.m.

Rodrigue then got out of the car and another shot was heard, the Sheriff’s Office said. SWAT teams were sent to the scene as a precautionary measure. Investigators then learned that Rodrigue had fatally shot himself.

Deputies found illegal drugs in Rodrigue’s possession and drug paraphernalia, authorities said. He was also on probation from a prior drug probation. Rodrigue has had prior arrests including possession of schedule II drugs, illegal possession of a stolen firearm and a probation violation.

The unidentified passenger, whose suicidal threats resulted in the initial call, was questioned and taken to a local hospital for observation, the Sheriff’s Office said.

The incident remains under investigation.
