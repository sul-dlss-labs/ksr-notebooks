Deputy kills suspect in woman's disappearance

Man had opened fire during arrest attempt

A Harris County deputy constable fatally shot a man who opened fire early Sunday morning when officers tried to serve an arrest warrant at a home where he was staying.

Johnny J. Roth III, 23, was shot and killed about 2:30 a.m. at a northwest Harris County apartment complex at 300 N. Vista Drive.

A Precinct 4 deputy constable was slightly injured in the gunfire when he was grazed by a bullet, possibly fired by one of the other officers at the scene, investigators said.

"One of the bullets came through the wall and struck the officer in the left hip area," said Precinct 4 Chief Deputy Jim Sumner. "It was minor, thank God. It just caused bruising. It didn't even pierce the skin."

The deputy stayed at the scene and did not require major medical attention, Sumner said.

Roth and another man at the apartment, Billy McCoy, 24, were wanted for questioning in the December 2002 disappearance of a Wichita Falls woman.

After learning the two men were considering fleeing to Mexico, Wichita Falls police detectives asked authorities in Tomball to take McCoy into custody on an outstanding warrant from Montgomery County for violating his probation on a driving while intoxicated conviction.

Records show both men have lived in Tomball in the past.

Tomball police asked Precinct 4 constables to make the arrest when they learned the apartment complex was out of their jurisdiction. Sumner said one of the four constables wore civilian clothes and announced that he was delivering a pizza.

"The trick is to get him (the resident) to answer the door," Sumner said. "Everybody answers the door for the pizza guy."

A constable grabbed McCoy when he came to the front door, investigators said, but was dragged into the line of fire when the man tried to escape back inside.

Roth was inside the apartment, possibly lying on the floor just left of the front door. He was armed with a .357 revolver and fired two shots before being killed by the constables, sheriff's investigators said.

McCoy was being held by Harris County Sheriff's homicide investigators later Sunday and will be turned over to Wichita Falls police. The names of the deputy constables involved in the shooting will not be released until their families are notified, Sumner said.

Information about the missing woman was not available Sunday, a dispatcher with the Wichita Falls Police Department said.

The case is being investigated by the Harris County Sheriff's homicide division and the Harris County District Attorney's office -- standard practice in any officer-involved shooting.
