Police have not said if Brandon Evans killed Staci Coyne, but investigators did say the two knew each other.

Both were killed Saturday in Lawrenceburg, Indiana.

Evans, 33, was shot in an encounter with a Lawrenceburg police officer called to Summit Pointe Apartments to investigate a disturbance.

"Upon entering the apartment building and standing in the hallway, the officer was confronted by Brandon G. Evans, age 33, who was naked and holding a knife," Indiana State Police reported. "The Lawrenceburg officer fired at least one round."

Officers attempted first aid, but Evans died at the scene, police said.

Investigators reported that Coyne, 37, was found deceased in a nearby apartment. Her death has been ruled a homicide.

"Investigators believe the two incidents were connected and that Evans and Coyne knew each other," police said.

The Indiana State Police are investigating the shooting. The Hamilton County Coroner's Office is conducting the autopsies.

The Dearborn County prosecutor will review the incident after the investigation is complete.
