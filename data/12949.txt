OMAHA -- Omaha police have identified the man suspected of killing two people and critically wounding two others last weekend before he was killed by police.

Police said Saturday that 25-year-old Jorge Abraham Zarazua-Rubio was the suspect in the June 15 shootings.

Authorities said Zarazua-Rubio targeted his first shooting victim, 31-year-old Aaron Anderson, before going on to shoot three other people he encountered that afternoon.

Anderson and 46-year-old Angel Cabrera were critically wounded in the shootings, but 25-year-old Anthony Vazzano and 25-year-old Pascual Bautista-Raymundo were both killed.

Vazzano was fatally shot while trimming a lawn.

Bautista-Raymundo was found in an alley outside another residence with several gunshot wounds in his neck.

Officer Coral Walker then exchanged gunfire with the suspect, Zarazua-Rubio, killing him.

Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said after the shootings that Walker likely saved lives by killing the suspect because Zarazua-Rubio was carrying two loaded magazines for his gun.

Walker, a 13-year Omaha police veteran, remains on paid administrative leave while the incident is investigated.

Police said they still are looking for someone who may have witnessed the first shooting. That person may be driving a 1995 Ford Thunderbird with Iowa license plate BBH-574.

Zarazua-Rubio was born in Mexico, but it wasn't immediately clear how long he had been in the United States, said Jorge Espejel, the Mexican consul in Omaha.

The suspect's father lives in Minneapolis, and his mother lives in Mexico.
