Steven Bowman, a 60-year-old white man, was shot and killed by deputies Friday, Nov. 9, in the 45900 block of Desert Springs Drive in Lancaster, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Bowman was fatally shot about 10:20 a.m. by Los Angeles County sheriffâ€™s deputies after he lead them on an hourlong car chase through the Santa Clarita Valley.

Authorities believed Bowman robbed the Bank of America at 26811 Bouquet Canyon Road in Saugus. Police said he then fled, driving on the 14 Freeway. Just after 10 a.m., Bowman pulled off of the freeway, driving over a spike strip placed by police, and his dark-colored SUV was surrounded by sheriff's vehicles in a residential cul-de-sac.

He then got out of his vehicle as if to surrender, dropping his jacket to the ground. Bowman reached back into the car and began firing at deputies through the windshield, police said.

Multiple deputies returned fire from all sides of the SUV, blowing out the rear windshield and shattering the front. The suspect was shot and killed.

Anyone with additional information about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous may call Crime Stoppers by dialing (800) 222-TIPS (8477).
