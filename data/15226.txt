The Yavapai County Sheriff's Office has identified a Glendale resident as the man who was fatally shot by a deputy he allegedly attacked on Friday night.

Harvey Mullenax, 31, was wanted for arrest on parole violations and had been driving a stolen vehicle that fled from authorities on Interstate 17 earlier that day, according to a Sheriff's Office statement issued Monday.

Officials believe Mullenax hid the stolen vehicle moments before being spotted walking along Arizona 169 by Deputy Jason Morgan.

Morgan, a 17-year veteran of YCSO, said Mullenax ran from him on approach Friday evening, the statement said.

Morgan caught up to Mullenax in a commercial parking lot.

The Sheriff's Office says Mullenax attacked Morgan when the deputy confronted him. In an effort to escape, Mullenax allegedly entered the driver's side of the patrol car, causing the car to roll and the open door to continually strike Morgan during his efforts to make an arrest. That's when Morgan fired his service weapon.

Morgan told investigators he was in fear of his life when he shot Mullenax.

The patrol car came to a stop after hitting a tree, and another deputy arrived to place Mullenax in handcuffs.

Mullenax was taken to the Yavapai Regional Medical Center in Prescott and then flown to a Phoenix hospital, where he later died, according to Sheriff's Office reports.

Morgan was hospitalized overnight for injuries to his face and upper body, and he has several weeks of recovery ahead.
