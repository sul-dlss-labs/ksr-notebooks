A Brooklyn man was shot and killed by the police yesterday after he ran from officers, pulled out what was later identified as a fake pistol and pointed it at them, the authorities said.

It was the second time in two days that police officers shot and killed an armed man in Brooklyn, the authorities said. On Monday night, the police shot a knife-wielding man who had stabbed his wife and refused to free her when the police confronted him, they said.

In yesterday's shooting, the police said they arrived at the corner of Franklin and Greene Avenues in Bedford-Stuyvesant at 2:49 p.m. after receiving a call about a man with a gun. After witnesses gave the police a description of the gunman, officers spotted a man nearby who fit the description and ordered him against the wall, they said.

The man, identified by the police as Ernest Prather, 39, of 1496 Hancock Street, started running from the officers, the police said. A sergeant and an officer chased Mr. Prather on foot, while another officer followed in a squad car, they said.
