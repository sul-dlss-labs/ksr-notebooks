A Breaux Bridge woman was shot and killed Friday evening inside a Lafayette shopping mall where she worked.



An off-duty Lafayette police officer, working security detail for the mall, shot and killed the accused gunman, said police spokesman Corporal Mark Francis.



The name of the accused gunman has not been released, but police say he knew the female victim. "It appears to be domestic," Lafayette Police Corporal Mark Francis said.



The victim, 21-year-old Sherika Broussard, was shot inside the storeroom of Victoria's Secret at the Mall of Acadiana, where she worked, police said. The shooting happened at 5:35pm Friday.



The off-duty officer who shot the accused gunman was identified as Detective Dustin Firmin, a three-year veteran of the force.



As a matter of routine procedure, Firmin will be placed on administrative leave with pay while the shooting is investigated, Francis said.



Firmin was working an off-duty security job for the Mall of Acadiana, Francis said.



Witnesses told security workers at the mall which exit the gunman had run out of, and officers found him at his vehicle in the parking lot.



Francis says the off-duty officer shot the man after he allegedly pulled out a gun.
