Police have released the name of a driver who died in a crash after he fled from a police officer early Sunday.



Novie Sessoms Jr., 25, of Oklahoma City, was pulled over for speeding about 2:35 a.m. at Hefner Road and N MacArthur Blvd., Capt. Dexter Nelson said Monday.



Sessoms stopped his vehicle, and then drove off. The officer followed him, but stopped pursuing when speeds reached 100 mph eastbound on Hefner Road, Nelson said.



The officer broadcast a description of the vehicle over the police radio. Seconds later, the vehicle was found in the parking lot of Children's Eye Care in the 11000 block of Hefner Pointe Drive.



"It appears the driver failed to negotiate the curve at the intersection," Nelson said.

The vehicle left the roadway and traveled along a grassy area before going airborne about 40 yards over a lower lying area in the parking lot. Sessoms was ejected at some point and was pronounced dead at the scene, Nelson said.
