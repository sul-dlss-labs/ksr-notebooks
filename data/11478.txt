Two people are dead in Indio after police officers shot a suspect Monday, June 25.

Officers were dispatched just before 2:30 p.m. Monday, June 25, to a shots-fired call at the Las Brisas Apartments in the 81-900 block of Hoover Street, said Benjamin Guitron, spokesman for the Police Department.

The first officer to arrive saw a man who had just shot into a vehicle occupied by a woman, Guitron said. The man confronted the officer and began striking him in the face and shoulder with the hand holding the gun.

When other officers arrived, fearing for the safety of the confronted officer, the suspect was shot and killed in “an officer-involved shooting,” Guitron said.

The woman in the vehicle was found to be dead of one or more gunshot wounds.

The assaulted officer was taken to a hospital for treatment of facial and dental injuries, but an update on his condition was not available, Guitron said. The injuries did not appear to be life-threatening.

The Riverside County coroner’s office arrived to begin an investigation into the deaths, and sheriff’s investigators arrived to assist with the investigation into the officer-involved shooting.

So far, investigators have been unable to determine a motive for why the man shot the woman, Guitron said.
