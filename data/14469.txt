BIRMINGHAM, AL (WBRC) - One man was killed and another injured early Saturday morning after a shooting at a Birmingham nightclub shut down earlier this week by the Birmingham City Council.



Police were called out to the Foxx Trap Gentlemans Club on 2nd Avenue North just before 4 a.m. Police say two security officers working at the club got into an altercation in the parking lot. One of the officers, Jonathan Asuzu, shot the other security officer, Brandon Cephus, wounding him.



An off duty Birmingham Police officer at the scene told Asuzu to drop his weapon. Asuzu did not comply and was shot by the off duty officer. Asuzu was pronounced dead on the scene.



Cephus was transported to a local hospital. The Alabama Bureau of Investigation is conducting

the investigation.



The Birmingham City Council voted to revoke the Foxx Trap's license because of safety concerns. Police say they have responded to 201 separate incidents at the club including underage drinking and at least seven other shootings. The owner of the Foxx Trap said a judge allowed the club to stay open until an appeal is heard.
