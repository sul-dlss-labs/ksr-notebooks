The police have not identified the officer who shot Clark after he reportedly pointed a loaded AK-47 at officers, but he has been placed on administrative leave pending an outcome of the investigation. Officers identified themselves as they broke open the door of the residence, police said. Police Lt. Terry Hastings said officers announcing as they enter is standard procedure to prevent drugs from being flushed or destroyed. He said police serve about 200 warrants a year. The last two shots were fired was on Madison Street last year, when two SWAT officers were shot.

Police said the warrant was authorized because crack cocaine had been purchased from Clark at the house and the house had been under surveillance periodically for several weeks. No cocaine was found in the raid following the entry of the home today, but a marijuana growing operation was found, according to the police statement.

He was paroled in March 2003 and completed parole Sept. 10, 2010.
