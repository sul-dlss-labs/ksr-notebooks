A 58-year-old man shot by police Wednesday morning had earlier threatened a family member with a gun, a police official said.

The man was identified as Ronald David Henry Jr.

Just after 9 a.m. police were called to a Quick Mart convenience store near the intersection of North Country Club and East Kleindale roads, said Sgt. Chris Widmer, a spokesman for the Tucson Police Department.

A man told officers he was involved in an altercation with a family member who threatened him with a gun before driving away.

“The victim advised that the family member had displayed aggressive behavior and had threatened to harm himself,” Widmer said.

The victim went to a home in the 2800 block of East Glenn Street between North Country Club Road and Tucson Boulevard, where he again encountered Henry with the gun. He was still holding the handgun while the two men argued in the front yard. Another family member in the house called 911, Widmer said.

Officers in two patrol cars arrived at the home just as the Henry was backing out of the driveway and pulled in behind his car, Widmer said.

Henry remained in the car, but began waving the gun around and pointing it at his head, Widmer said.

“According to witnesses the suspect was making suicidal statements with the gun in his hand,” said Widmer. “Witnesses also reported hearing the officers negotiated and plead with the suspect for several minutes to put the gun down.

“At one point the suspect pointed the weapon at the officers” and shots were fired, Widmer said.

He did not say whether one or both officers fired, how many shots were fired or whether the suspect fired his gun.

Henry was taken to a hospital where he died.
