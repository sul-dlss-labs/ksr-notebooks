A 21-year-old Brooklyn man being sought in the shooting of two men on Thursday morning was killed yesterday during a struggle with a detective when the detective's gun went off, the police said.

The man, Stephone Crawford, 21, was pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. He did not have a gun with him but did have a straight razor in his pocket, the police said.

The detective, whose name was not released, suffered minor injuries.

Police officials said yesterday that the shooting appeared to be accidental. The 41-year-old detective, a 14-year veteran of the force who had never been involved in a shooting, acted appropriately in drawing his gun while chasing a suspect believed to be violent, said Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman.

Mr. Crawford's relatives reacted with anger to his death, asking why he had been shot in the back of his head, especially since it seemed that he had not displayed a weapon.
