Tahlequah Police say a man died after a chase early Thursday.

Tahlequah Police Chief Nate King says the chase began after the driver ran through a four-way stop at about 70 miles per hour just before 2 a.m. He said Officer Justin Yates witnessed the incident and attempted to stop the car which sped away.

The chase wound its way around the town before leaving the city limits on a dirt road.

King says the officer backed off from his pursuit due to low visibility. A few minutes later, King says, the officer found the car rolled over and the driver ejected from it.

The chief identified the driver as 31-year-old Brandon Hestwood. Hestwood was pronounced dead at the scene.

An investigation into the crash continues.
