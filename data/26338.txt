The Hampton Police Division is conducting a death investigation as a result of an armed-barricaded subject call that occurred on July 25, 2019.

At approximately 3:16 a.m., Public Safety Communications received a call in reference to a subject suffering from a mental illness inside of a residence in the 100 block of Findley Square. The call was upgraded when information was received that the suspect was armed with a weapon.

Upon arrival Hampton patrol officers, whom are trained in crisis intervention, made an attempt to communicate with the individual to deescalate the situation when several shots were fired inside the residence. The patrol officers took tactical cover at which time Hampton’s SWAT team and Crisis Negotiations team were activated. The Hampton SWAT team as well as the Crisis Negotiation Team responded to the scene and while attempting to make contact with the suspect, made contact with two additional males inside the home. Officers were able to assist these individuals in exiting the home safely.

Subsequently, Hampton SWAT members made entry into the residence at which time they located the male suspect and a female deceased. The identity of both individuals is being withheld until next-of-kin has been identified. The investigation remains on-going and there are no additional details to release at this time.
