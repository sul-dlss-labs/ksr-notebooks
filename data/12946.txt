CASTRO VALLEY (CBS SF) - The suspect who was fatally shot in a confrontation with two Alameda County sheriff's deputies at a restaurant in Castro Valley on Friday night was a parolee at large from Oakland, authorities said Tuesday.

Sheriff's spokesman Sgt. J.D. Nelson identified the suspect as 32-year-old Quincy Williams and said he had three felony convictions for robbery, drugs and theft.

Williams also had "numerous" other arrests for similar offenses, Nelson said.

Williams was fatally shot at Boulevard Burger at 3714 Castro Valley Blvd. in Castro Valley shortly after 10 p.m. Friday, about an hour after it had closed for the night.

According to the sheriff's office, Williams—who was wearing a mask, dressed completely in black and was carrying a .357 revolver—entered the restaurant, held a female employee at gunpoint and demanded cash.

But two male employees who had noticed two sheriff's deputies conducting an unrelated traffic stop nearby grabbed and held Williams and told the female worker to get the deputies' attention, Nelson said.

The deputies went to the restaurant, and one fired multiple rounds at Williams after Williams' revolver discharged when one of the male employees grabbed his arm during a struggle, according to Nelson.

Williams was shot multiple times and died, Nelson said.

No one else was hit by the gunfire, although the employee who

grabbed Williams' arm suffered a minor powder burn from the errant shot by Williams, Nelson said.

Boulevard Burger was closed for more than two days after the incident but reopened on Monday.
