South Milwaukee police have identified a 40-year-old man who died when his car collided with another vehicle during a police chase Wednesday night and are confirming he shot and killed himself.

Police said Thursday that Douglas J. Fairbanks had been under surveillance at his home after police received a child pornography complaint earlier Wednesday.

Officers tried to pull over the man when he left his home shortly after 8:35 p.m. The man refused to stop and led officers on a chase that ended when his car struck a vehicle that was turning at College and Chicago avenues, South Milwaukee Police Chief Ann Wellens said. A gun went off in the car at the time of the crash, police said. Officers initially had to investigate whether the gunshot was accidental.

A 23-year-old Cudahy woman was taken to Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa with minor injuries in the other vehicle. She was later released.
