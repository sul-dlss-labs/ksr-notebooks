PITTSBURG (CBS SF) - A parolee who led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a fatal three-car crash in Pittsburg on Monday has died from his injuries, a police lieutenant said.

Jacquay Johnson, 26, of Concord, died at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento around 7 p.m. Monday, hours after a mid-morning crash that killed his passenger, 47-year-old Rita Montes Martinez, of Pittsburg, and left two other people seriously injured, authorities said.

Johnson—who was on parole for robbery and had a warrant out for his arrest—fled from police after an officer tried to pull him over for speeding around 10:40 a.m. Monday, Pittsburg police Lt. Ron Raman said.

Heading west on Buchanan Road in Pittsburg at speeds over 70 mph, the parolee's truck hit an SUV that was traveling north on Railroad Avenue.

Raman said the SUV's two occupants, a Pittsburg man and woman, are in serious but stable condition and are expected to survive.

The third car involved sustained minor damage and its occupants were uninjured.

Raman said police have not yet determined the relationship between Johnson and Martinez, who was pronounced dead at the scene. She is survived by two adult children.

Raman said Johnson had a long criminal history, with prior arrests for stealing a vehicle and several drug-related crimes, and had violated the terms of his parole at least three times this year.

He said the officer who pursued Johnson on Monday is now on paid administrative leave while the district attorney's office investigates the incident, as is standard procedure for an officer-involved fatality.
