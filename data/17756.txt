CULPEPER COUNTY, Va. -- Virginia State Police are investigating a deadly encounter at a home in Culpeper Tuesday night.

Two people were killed and one person was injured after Culpeper Sheriff's Deputies responded to a home on Gray Street in the village of Norman.

Police have identified the shooting victims as Willis N. Walker Jr., 49, and James Stewart, 74, both of Culpeper.

The deputies were called to the home for a report of breaking and entering and/or domestic violence.

The Sheriff's Office said the incident began shortly before 9 p.m., when a woman fled to her residence after getting into an argument and being threatened at gunpoint by her estranged husband, Willis N. Walker Jr., 49.

Deputies say Walker followed her to the neighbor’s residence and forced his way inside at gunpoint. Once inside the residence, Walker shot and killed the neighbor, James Stewart, 74.

Walker then searched the Stewart’s house for his estranged wife, whom he found and violently assaulted.

A second woman, who was hiding inside the house at the time, called 911 and the Culpeper County Sheriff’s Office responded to the residence.

"Upon arrival officers were confronted by a man wielding a firearm," a sheriff's office spokesperson said. "He refused to comply with their repeated commands to put down his weapon. Instead, Walker began advancing towards the deputies threatening them with the shotgun, at which time one of the deputies fired at Walker."

Walker died at the scene. No deputies were injured in the incident.

Walker’s estranged wife was transported to the UVA Culpeper Hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.

Walker’s remains have been transported to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Manassas for examination and autopsy.

Virginia State Police is now handling the ongoing investigation.
