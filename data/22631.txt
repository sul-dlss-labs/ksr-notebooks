NORTH ST. LOUIS COUNTY â€¢ A man was charged with second-degree murder and resisting arrest Saturday, a day after allegedly fleeing police in north St. Louis County and causing a car crash that left one person killed and another in critical condition.

The man, Demetric Loyd, 19, of the 300 block of Henquin Drive in Ferguson, was being held Saturday with cash bail set at $250,000, police said.

The victim killed in the crash was identified by St. Louis County Police as D'wayne Watson, 20, of the 4000 block of Fieldstone Drive in Florissant. Watson was the front-seat passenger of the vehicle struck in the accident.

The driver of the vehicle was identified only as a 21-year-old male who remains hospitalized.

The crash took place around 11:40 a.m. Friday, at New Halls Ferry Road and Netherton Drive near Florissant, in unincorporated St. Louis County.

According to county police, Loyd was seen speeding southbound on New Halls Ferry Road by a Florissant police officer driving in the opposite direction.

When the officer turned around and threw on the patrol vehicle's lights and siren, Loyd's black Dodge Charger accelerated further. Approaching an intersection about a mile down the road, the Charger collided with the vehicle carrying Watson at approximately 90 mph.

Several eyewitnesses identified Loyd as the driver of the Charger.
