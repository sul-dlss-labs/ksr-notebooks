STANSBURY PARK, Tooele County — A 37-year-old Stansbury Park man died Saturday after he was ejected in a crash.

Police were seeking Mark Richard Johnson for questioning in connection with a domestic dispute at his home, Tooele Police Lt. Travis Scharmann said.

Tooele County Sheriff's Sgt. Jason Sparks found what he believed was Johnson's vehicle in the Stansbury Park area, began to follow it and confirmed the vehicle was registered to Johnson.

Johnson stopped his vehicle on the side of a road, and Sparks parked behind him to attempt to make contact. But "the vehicle immediately drove away," Scharmann said. Sparks followed, and when Johnson ran through a stop sign at the intersection of Brigham Road and state Route 138, the sergeant activated his lights.

Scharmann said Johnson immediately "swerved in the roadway, causing the vehicle to exit the roadway and overturn." Johnson was ejected in the crash and was stuck under the vehicle after it rolled.

It did not appear that the man was wearing a seat belt.

Scharmann said the incident is under investigation by the Utah Highway Patrol.
