"He's been kind of depressed for a lot of times. He's been really down and almost suicidal," says Delbert Royer, Jr. "Its been coming for a long time."

Royer says things finally came to a head when his father, Delbert Sr., went to a DeQuincy apartment complex to start a fight with his other son.

Delbert Royer, Jr. says, "he just got on a rampage today and was going to try to end it all for everything and everybody."

Even, according to law enforcement officers, if that meant shooting at police.

Trooper Stephen LaFargue says, "the driver turned with a weapon outside of his drivers door and fired at the officers. The officers fired back striking the individual."

Royer Jr. says this isn't the first problem they've had. "He's been this way for a pretty good long time and I've lived with him and I've dealt with it for a pretty long time."

But he says, no one wanted it to end the way it did: His 74-year-old father dead from a gunshot wound to the chest

"I mean they stopped him and they were basically doing their job. One of them told me he was sorry, I really don't know. I haven't made up my mind on that particular subject yet. I just think its like getting hit with a brick wall you know. I'm just trying to get more information."

It may take a while before Delbert Royer, Jr. gets all of the answers he is seeking. Trooper LaFargue says they are still in the fact-finding process of the investigation. State police investigators have to interview the officers involved, as well as family members and anyone else involved in the domestic disturbance that apparently started the series of events leading up to Royer's death. Tests will also be run to determine which officer fired the fatal shot.
