A man who stole a patrol car and then carjacked a driver in an SUV was fatally struck once in the chest when deputies opened fire on him early Thursday in Poway, sheriff’s officials said Friday.

Trenton Lohman, 38, of Lakeside, was on parole for battery causing serious bodily injury and possession of methamphetamine, and previously served time in prison for robbery, sheriff’s homicide Lt. Kenn Nelson said.

Four deputies fired at Lohman at two locations along Poway Road as he led deputies on a brief chase that ended when he crashed the SUV. The names of the deputies have not yet been made public.

The series of shootings began when someone reported a prowler looking into vehicles with a flashlight at George and Kat’s Auto Service on Poway Road near Adah Lane about 6:50 a.m. Thursday, Nelson said. Deputies got there within two minutes and shortly after reported shots had been fired.

Lohman got into a deputy’s patrol car and sped off as other deputies chased him east on Poway Road.

At Espola Road, Lohman got out and carjacked a nearby driver. Shortly after, deputies caught up to the stolen SUV and shot at Lohman, who then veered into a brushy ravine near Espola and Poway roads.

Lohman was found dead behind the steering wheel.

Deputies found knives, a hatchet and loose handgun ammunition in the SUV. Nelson said investigators believe the items belonged to Lohman.

Deputies also found a handgun used in the carjacking.

Investigators believe a bullet-riddled SUV at the Poway Road auto shop was Lohman’s. They have not completed a search of the vehicle, Nelson said.

Nelson did not say whether the suspect fired at the deputies.
