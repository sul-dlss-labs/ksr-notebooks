The Adams County coroner’s office on Thursday identified the 49-year-old Denver man who was fatally shot Monday afternoon by Westminster police.

Thomas Tucker Jr. was gunned down by officers during a confrontation near the intersection of West 121st Avenue and Huron Street. Investigators say Tucker was armed and suspected in a burglary.

The incident began after police were called at about 3:30 p.m. Monday to the 12100 block of Bannock Street on a report of a break-in. A resident there had come home to find people in his garage loading items into a silver Chevrolet Malibu, said Cheri Spotke, a Westminster police spokeswoman.

The resident confronted the burglars and was punched in the face. One burglar then pulled a gun and pointed it at the resident, Spotke said.

Three burglars, all men, got into the Malibu, which was driven by a woman with pink hair, and they fled. The burglar who punched the resident and pointed a gun at the victim fled on a motorcycle.

Responding officers quickly spotted the motorcycle in the 12100 block of Huron, Spotke said. The motorcyclist tried to speed off but crashed the bike. The suspect then tried to flee on foot, investigators say.

Officers chased the suspect on foot. And when they tried to take him into custody, the man — identified as Tucker — brandished a weapon. Two Westminster officers fired at Tucker, who was hit by police gunfire.

The shooting remains under investigation. Authorities are still searching for the other burglary suspects.
