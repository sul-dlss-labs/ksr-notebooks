A speeding motorcyclist died in a collision during a pursuit away from Chula Vista police Saturday night.

The identity of the rider was not immediately known.

The incident began about 10 p.m. when an officer saw a Yamaha motorcycle rider blow through a red light at Heritage Street and Olympic Parkway at about 80 mph, Chula Vista police Lt. Eric Thunberg said.

The officer followed the motorcyclist north onto Interstate 805, then lost sight of it after the rider exited at Telegraph Canyon Road westbound and swerved around traffic. Officers caught up to him after he crashed on L Street, near First Avenue, and died, Thunberg said.

He said the rider crested a hill and veered into the eastbound lane into the path of a pickup truck. The truck driver tried to swerve and brake, but the vehicles collided.

The impact disintegrated the motorcycle, which flew over a wall into a homeâ€™s driveway. The rider was thrown about 60 feet before he hit a parked car, then an SUV that was parked in a driveway. He landed partly under the vehicle and was declared dead at the scene of the accident, Thunberg said.

A woman in the pickup complained of pain to her legs, while a man in the truck was not injured, Thunberg said.

The roadway was closed during an investigation.
