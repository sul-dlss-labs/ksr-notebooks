A 34-year-old driver fled from troopers in St. Paul early Tuesday and then fatally shot himself, according to the Minnesota State Patrol.

Shortly after 2 a.m., troopers tried to stop a vehicle seen weaving on eastbound Interstate 94 near Pascal Street, according to Lt. Tiffani Nielson, State Patrol spokeswoman.

The driver, identified as Keith L. King, didn’t stop and led troopers on a pursuit into downtown St. Paul, Nielson said. Authorities put out stop sticks on I-94 at John Ireland Boulevard and the vehicle came to a stop on the freeway near Robert Street.

As troopers approached the vehicle, King shot himself, according to Nielson and the Ramsey County medical examiner’s office. The St. Paul man was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:26 a.m.

“Even though there was no use of force by officers on the scene, the State Patrol requested the Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) assist in the investigation,” Nielson said in a statement.

King indicated on his Facebook page that he went to St. Paul’s Como Park Senior High School, studied culinary arts and more at St. Paul College, and was a cook and chef at a number of restaurants. A brother of King’s declined comment.

In March, Dakota County prosecutors charged King with several felonies and he was due to go to trial Oct. 2. He had pleaded not guilty to possession of burglary tools, along with possession of morphine, acetaminophen and Oxycodone.
