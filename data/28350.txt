JOHNSON CITY (AP) â€” Johnston City Police shot and killed a man Tuesday night while responding to a domestic dispute call, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

After a preliminary investigation, the TBI released the following account of events. Police were called to a Johnson City home just before 7 p.m. about a domestic disturbance involving an intoxicated man. Upon arrival, they found Kevin Lee Catlett, 62, standing in the middle of the street and holding a gun.

Catlett refused to drop the weapon when ordered. At some point, he pointed the gun at officers and one of the officers shot him. Catlett was pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured.
