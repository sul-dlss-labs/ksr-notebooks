From the official Anne Arundel County Police release:

On September 2, 2009, at approximately 6:30 a.m., officers from the Anne Arundel County Police Department’s Southern District responded to the 200 block of Ella Welch Way in Lothian, Maryland for an ex parte violation.

Upon arrival, officers discovered apparent forced entry to the exterior door and two females inside the residence. Both females had gunshot wounds and were deceased. The victims were identified as the resident, 50-year-old Sheena Blandford and her sister, Cheryl Timmons, 55, of the 1800 block of Copeland Street in Annapolis, MD.

Witnesses told detectives that they contacted police after observing 51-year-old Theodore Nathaniel Blandford, of that address, forcefully enter the residence. Blandford was recently served with a protective order to vacate the house and the order was obtained by his wife Sheena Blandford in August of 2009.

Detectives received information that Blandford was located at an address in the Upper Marlboro area of Prince George’s County. Consequently, detectives contacted members of the Prince George’s County Police Department and requested their assistance in checking for the suspect at that address.

Officers located the suspect’s sport utility vehicle in the Largo area of Prince George’s County and attempted to stop the vehicle. A chase ensued and eventually ended in the area of Minnesota Avenue and East Capitol Street in Southeast, DC.

According to Prince George’s County Police, Blandford fled from the vehicle armed with a handgun. At some point during the foot chase, officers fired at the subject and struck him. Blandford was transported to Prince George’s Hospital Center, where he died from his wounds at approximately 11:30 a.m. Any questions related to the pursuit or the shooting can be referred to the Prince George’s County Police Department’s Press Information Office. Please note that a mug shot of the suspect will be available in the morning.
