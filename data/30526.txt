COMMERCE CITY, Colo. (KDVR) – A man is dead after a police shooting in Commerce City Monday.

It happened around noon, after officers were dispatched to the 7500 block of Brighton Boulevard for a family disturbance.

Police say they were confronted by a man with a knife, and two officers shot the suspect. The suspect sustained critical injuries and was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

A Commerce City Police spokesman said both officers are on administrative leave during a critical incident response team investigation.

The victim’s aunt, Nicole Martinez, tells FOX31 the family called police, concerned for her nephew’s mental health. The aunt says the victim, Robert Alire, is schizophrenic, and the family wanted to get him to a hospital to get medication.

Martinez says Commerce City Police shot and killed her nephew.

“She’s going crazy,” Martinez said referring to the victim’s mother. “She says she wished she would’ve never called the cops. She just did it to get him help, just needed help to get him his medication, not be dead. I just don’t think what they did was right, how they went about it. They have to change the way they go about approaching people with mental Illness.”

It’s not clear what lead up to the shooting, but the 17th Judicial District Critical Incident Team is investigating. These type of investigations are triggered when officers use their firearms.
