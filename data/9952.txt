WASHINGTON (Bergen County) — A man was shot and killed by police in Washington Township early this morning after a stand-off with officers, Bergen County Prosecutor John Molinelli said.

Police were called to the scene of a domestic disturbance on the 500 block of Jackson Avenue at around 1:30 a.m., where Robert Ellis, 48, was on the porch of his parents' home with a gun, and allegedly fired several times at the approaching officers, Molinelli said.

After Ellis fired at officers several times from the porch, at least three officers returned fire, Molinelli said. At least one bullet hit a police car.

Officers from Westwood and Hillsdale also responded, Molinelli said, while Ellis allegedly kept firing from in and outside the home. The gun battle lasted 15 to 30 minutes.

Ellis — who would have turned 49 this Friday — was shot several times and pronounced dead at the scene. His last known address was in Ridgewood, and it was not immediately clear whether he was staying in his parents’ home or had been visiting when the incident occurred.

It was not known what type of gun Ellis had or why he shot at the officers, and further details regarding the initial domestic disturbance report were not disclosed. No one else at the residence was injured during the incident or the subsequent gun battle.



No criminal charges have been filed yet, Molinelli said, and an investigation is ongoing.



Calls to the Ellis home in Washington Township were not answered.
