Crime & Safety Man ID'd In Deadly Cabazon Sheriff's Shooting Authorities on Wednesday identified a man who allegedly "... pointed a metal object simulating a weapon..." at deputies. Reply

CABAZON,CA - Authorities Wednesday released the name of a man shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy in Cabazon last month after allegedly pointing a metal object at the deputy and refusing to drop it when ordered. Edward Manning III, 26, was shot March 4 in an open field south of Interstate 10 after running from deputies. He died the following morning at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs.

Deputies initially responded at about 9:30 p.m. March 4 to a report of a "suspicious person near a business" in the 48600 block of Seminole Drive. When deputies approached Manning, he ran east on Seminole Drive, then dodged traffic and ran across Interstate 10, Sgt. Chris Durham said.

The chase then took deputies to a dark field near Johnson Lane, south of I-10.

"During a foot pursuit through a dark field, the suspect pointed a metal object simulating a weapon at the deputy," Durham said. "The deputy ordered the suspect to drop the object which the deputy believed was a firearm. The suspect refused and a deputy involved shooting took place."

No deputies were hurt in the incident.



The name of the deputy who shot Manning was not released, but the deputy was placed on administrative leave per department policy, Durham said. "This is still an active and ongoing investigation," he added. "Anyone with information regarding the incident is encouraged to contact Central Homicide Unit Master Investigator Dickey at (951) 955-2777 or Investigator Hensley at (951) 922-7100 from the Cabazon Station."
