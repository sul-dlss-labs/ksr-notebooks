ORIGINAL STORY

Las Vegas police are investigating a fatal crash that involved an officer late Tuesday night.

A motorcycle collided with a marked Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department patrol SUV on Rampart Boulevard near Point Conception Drive at about 10:45 p.m., according to authorities.

Police say the patrol vehicle was making a U-turn when the motorcyclist struck the SUV. The 23-year-old rider was pronounced deceased at the scene while the 38-year-old officer was not injured.

Due to the fatality, Nevada Revised Statutes requires that another jurisdiction investigate the collision. Therefore, the Nevada Highway Patrol has taken over the investigation.

Police say a speed component is being considered but further investigation is needed to determine right of way.

This collision marks the 80th traffic-related fatality in the LVMPD's jurisdiction for the year 2021.

The Clark County coroner will release the name of the man deceased.
