Richard Hughes, a 38-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police Thursday, Jan. 5, in the 1700 block of Riverside Drive in Glendale, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The incident began about 1 p.m. when Hughes' girlfriend called 911, saying that her boyfriend was violent and wanted to commit suicide, according to Sgt. Tom Lorenz of the Glendale Police Department.

Officers responded, and Hughes lunged at them with the knife, Lorenz said. One of the officers fired his handgun at least once, fatally wounding the man.

"It appears, based on the statements at the scene and the evidence, that this was a suicide by cop," Lorenz told The Times.

Anyone with additional information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
