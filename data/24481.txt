A man died early Thursday after crashing at more than 100 mph while trying to escape a pursuing El Paso County sheriff's deputy.

The chase began just before 3 a.m. when a deputy noticed a car driving "erratically" on East Woodmen Road, Colorado Springs police spokesman Lt. Howard Black said.

"When the deputy made the decision to pull him over, the driver sped off at a high rate of speed, and, within a minute and a half to two minutes, the guy lost control," said Black.

The car clipped a steel pole and rolled several times, and the driver was partially thrown from the vehicle.

"It was a horrendous scene," Black said.

The county Coronerâ€™s Office identified the driver as Ron Cisco, 43.

The wreck closed the westbound lanes of East Woodmen Road at Tutt Boulevard and the southbound North Powers Boulevard off-ramp to westbound Woodmen for more than four hours, police said.

Police have taken over the investigation. It is not clear whether alcohol or drugs were involved.

"That's what the deputy was trying to find out (before the crash) because of the way the driver was driving. There was obviously concern to initiate a traffic stop," Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby told KKTV.

Sheriff's Office policy requires deputies "to weigh the importance of apprehending suspects who unlawfully flee from law enforcement against the risks associated with vehicle pursuits," according to the policy manual on its website.
