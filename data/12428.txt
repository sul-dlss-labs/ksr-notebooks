A Perdido man involved in a police chase earlier this year has been indicted on a reckless murder charge in Escambia County, according to officials with the Escambia County Circuit Clerk’s office.

Roil Lamar Hadley, Jr. has been indicted by a grand jury after he allegedly fled from Poarch Creek Tribal Police officers and Alabama state troopers in May, according to law enforcement officials with the Escambia County Sheriff’s Department. The chase began in the area of Wind Creek Casino and Hotel and continued to Poarch Road, where Hadley’s tire reportedly blew, causing the vehicle to flip. According to the indictment, Hadley’s passenger, Benjamin Harrison, was ejected from the vehicle and died from injuries sustained in the crash.

Hadley, who has an extensive criminal record in both Escambia and Baldwin counties, has been detained in the Escambia County Detention Center in Brewton since May 8, 2012. He is currently being held on bond amounts of $150,000 and $300,000.
