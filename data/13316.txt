SULLIVAN — Joseph Crist, 58, of Sullivan, was shot to death by police Sunday night in Georgia, after a standoff which shut down an interstate highway for nearly five hours.

After his car broke down on an overpass on Interstate 20, Crist told a family member he was considering taking his own life, said Coroner Vernon Collins of Columbia County, Ga.

The police were notified some time before 7:30 p.m. Sunday and the Columbia County Sheriff’s Department brought in a hostage negotiation team and crisis management unit, while shutting down traffic on the highway.

“They worked with him for four hours,” Collins said in a phone interview. “At one point he raised a weapon toward an officer and another officer had no recourse but to shoot Mr. Crist.”

Crist was pronounced dead at the scene shortly before midnight.

An autopsy showed that Crist died from multiple gunshot wounds to his torso. The autopsy was performed at a Georgia Bureau of Investigation lab in Decatur, Ga.

The coroner said he believed Crist was in the area because he was offered a job in Atlanta. The incident occurred near Grovetown, just west of Augusta, Ga.

Crist may have been depressed because of a recent family loss, according to a relative.

“We were told his father died recently,” Collins said.

The coroner said the shooting was just a tragic event.

“It should have never happened,” Collins said. “He may have had some other issues in his life. (The car breakdown) may have been the straw that broke the camel’s back.”

Collins said the shooting death not only affects Crist and his family, but law enforcement officers who were involved, especially the one who shot him.

“It affects the deputy for his whole life,” Collins said. “Law enforcement officers go into it to save lives and make society safe, not to shoot people.”
