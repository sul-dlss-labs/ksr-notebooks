Tuscaloosa County Sheriff Ted Sexton said two deputies who shot and killed a Tuscaloosa man while serving a warrant had no choice. He made the comments at a news conference on Tuesday.

Sexton said it happened last night during a foot chase through the parking lot of Aspen Village Apartments. He said 50-year-old Lawrence Davis shot at deputies who tried to arrest him for failing to appear in court on a cocaine possession charge. The deputies returned fire and Davis was killed. The deputies were not injured. The shooting occurred at about 8:30 p-m.

The Alabama Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting. The deputies were placed on administrative leave with pay. Sexton said a grand jury will review the case to determine whether the shootings were justified. He also said that two small packages believed to contain crack cocaine and a revolver were found near Davis' body.
