Police on Friday identified an armed man shot and killed by officers in the early hours of New Year’s Day.

Saul Soriano, 41, was shot about 2:20 a.m. Thursday by three Los Angeles Police Department officers in the crawl space of a home’s garage converted to a living area in the 14100 block of Terra Bella Street, said Officer Julianne Sohn, an LAPD spokeswoman.

Officers arrived at the house just after 12:30 a.m. in response to a 911 call about a man firing shots in the air and threatening his family during a New Year’s Eve party, said Lt. John Romero, another LAPD spokesman.

Police surrounded the main house and the converted garage and evacuated everyone before searching for the man, Romero said.

Soriano was armed when he was shot by police, Romero said.

The shooting ended a nearly two-hour search for Soriano through both buildings of the residence, Romero said, adding that police recovered a weapon. The incident was under investigation.
