HOLLYWOOD (CBSLA) - Los Angeles Police Department officers fatally shot a person in Hollywood Saturday, the department's second shooting in two days.

The shooting occurred at 2:37 p.m. at Sunset Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue after a man allegedly rammed the squad car of two officers officers who were responding to another emergency call, according to detectives.

The suspect exited his vehicle and appeared to be wearing body armor, say police and witnesses, as he approached officers who had also exited their squad car.

Officials say the suspect had his right hand hidden behind his back, counted backwards from three and then moved his arm forward when police opened fire and killed him.

Sunset Boulevard was shut down in the area for the investigation.

"They're looking at the body-worn video," said Det. Meghan Aguilar of the LAPD. "It sounds like he did say something. It was not intelligible to the detectives at this point."

The suspects vehicle was covered in writing and decals with messages that included "Cancel all Bibles," "Women Rule" and "New World Order."

Detectives did not find a weapon on the suspect.

Early Friday, officers investigating a call about a man armed with knife in the Valley Village early Friday shot and wounded the suspect.

The shooting was reported around 2:30 a.m. Friday in the 5200 block of Whitsett Avenue, near Magnolia Boulevard, police said.

"Officers responded to a call of a man armed (with) a knife," police said in a statement.

"When they encountered the man, they used less lethal munitions which were not effective (and) an OIS (officer-involved shooting) occurred. The man was struck by gunfire (and) taken to a local hospital where he is in stable condition."

No other injuries were reported, police said. A knife was recovered at the scene.
