COLEMAN ? A Coleman man died from a self-inflicted stab wound Thursday afternoon at the Coleman County jail.

According to preliminary information furnished by Sgt. Phil Chamber with the Coleman Police Department, John Paul Dobbins, 24, of Coleman had been remanded to the county jail after an appearance in district court Thursday. As Dobbins was being escorted out of the courthouse to the jail by sheriff's deputy Jeromy Watson, Dobbins assaulted the deputy and fled the courthouse.

He was immediately apprehended by other law enforcement personnel who were in the area. As he was being booked into the jail, which is located in a separate building behind the courthouse, Dobbins produced a knife and stabbed himself in the chest. It was unclear where he got the knife.

Dobbins was immediately taken by ambulance to the emergency room at the Coleman County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 3:33 p.m. An autopsy has been ordered.

The Coleman Police Department and Texas Ranger Danny Crawford will investigate since sheriff's department personnel were involved in the incident. According to information available through the sheriff's office, Watson was not injured in the escape attempt. The investigation is ongoing.
