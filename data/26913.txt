The Bossier City Police Department has identified the officer involved in the fatal shooting at LaQuinta Inn late last week.

Officer Patrick Edmonds Jr., is on administrative leave pending investigations by the Internal Affairs Division and Criminal investigations Division, the City of Bossier City announced in a news release on Monday.

Edmonds joined the department in May 2018 and is assigned to the patrol division.

Additional information will be released once the investigations along with a review by the Bossier Parish District Attorney's Office are complete, the news release continued.

These investigations are the result of a shooting that occurred early Friday morning at the LaQuina Inn, located at 309 Preston Boulevard in Bossier City.

Edmonds went to the hotel in response to a disorderly person call and encountered 45-year-old Shannon Rupert of Shreveport.

Rupert was allegedly waving around a pair of scissors while on a phone in the lobby of the hotel, the city stated in a previous news release.

"The officer gave multiple verbal commands to Rupert to put down the weapon. Rupert then aggressively approached the officer with scissors in hand. The officer fired two rounds from his department issued handgun striking Rupert in the upper torso," the previous news release read.

The woman was taken to Oschner LSU Health where she was pronounced dead.

The officer was not injured.
