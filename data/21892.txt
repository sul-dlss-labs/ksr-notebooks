CAMDEN, N.J. -- Interim Camden County Prosecutor Mike Chewkanes and Camden City Police Executive Arturo Venegas released today the name of an officer involved in a shooting Friday.

Officer Dean Gransden is a 13-year veteran of the Camden Police Department.

Gransden was in the area of Bank and Pfeiffer streets in Camden and came upon a domestic dispute at about 10:30 p.m. Friday.

Kashon Smith, 17, of the Ablett Village Apartments, allegedly had physically assaulted two cousins before threatening his mother with a knife and grill fork in her home. The mother fled to a neighbor's residence to call 9-1-1.

Smith followed her and encountered members of the neighbor's family outside. Allegedly, he verbally threatened them while brandishing the weapons.

Gransden, who was on patrol in the area, came upon the scene and reported the incident from his police cruiser as Smith's mother called 9-1-1.

Smith reportedly ignored Gransden's orders to put down the weapons and was poised to attack the neighbor's family. After repeated warnings the officer fired, killing Smith.

Smith's mother was inside the neighbor's home at the time of the shooting.

Gransden will remain on paid administrative leave while the Camden County Prosecutor's Office conducts an investigation into the shooting. Such an investigation is standard procedure whenever an officer is involved in a fatal shooting.
