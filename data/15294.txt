A man who spent his final Saturday morning inside an Iowa patrol car for a drunken driving arrest somehow managed to escape — only to be struck and killed moments later by an oncoming van.

Matthew Lentzkow, 36, was able to undo his seatbelt — despite being handcuffed with his hands behind his back — while in the front passenger seat of a Iowa state police car as an officer inspected Lentzkow's vehicle following his DWI arrest. He sat for two minutes then made a run for it, the Des Moines Register reported.

He ran behind the trooper's car onto Interstate-80 outside Des Moines despite orders from the officer to stop.

Moments later, 24-year-old Enrique Perez, who was driving a van, struck Lentzkow. The allegedly intoxicated man landed along the median and was pronounced dead on the scene.

It's apparently standard practice in Iowa to place a detainee in the front passenger seat. There isn't typically a cage separating the front from the back of the car and, as Iowa State Patrol spokesman Scott Bright said in the report, it's easier to see what the person is doing if they're in the front seat.

"If you look at history, if somebody is sitting next to you, you know what they're doing," Bright said. "If an individual is in the front seat, if they make any movements, you can see that."

There's no word on whether this deadly accident will prompt Iowa State Patrol to reconsider arrest policies and procedures.

Lentzkow has had several traffic and alcohol-related offenses in the past two decades. This past weekend was his third DWI charge.
