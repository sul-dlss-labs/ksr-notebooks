As families everywhere celebrated Father's Day together Sunday, in one Richmond Heights home violence tore a family apart.



Miami-Dade police said a man stabbed three women, all of them members of his family, before he lost his own life following a confrontation with police.



"I hear screaming, 'let me see your hands, let me see your hands' and then shots," said neighbor Xavier Davidson.

Police said the incident happened around 5:20 p.m. in the 15000 block of Monroe Street.



"There was some kind of confrontation, the officer fired and the subject is now deceased," said Lieutenant John Jenkins, with the Miami-Dade Police Department.



Miami-Dade Police said the suspect, Joe White III, 48, of Miami, tried to flee the stabbing scene in a white Pontiac. The bullet-riddled car ended up haphazardly parked next to a bus stop, just feet away from where Davidson and his children were getting ready to go for a cool dip in the pool.

"My first thing, was get my kids in the house," he said.



All three women were airlifted to Kendall Regional Hospital where their condition was unknown. The officer wasn't injured.



Neighbor Aniel Santos heard the gunshots and says he also saw helicopters looming in the sky. A helicopter used a grassy field next to a local church as a landing strip to get victims to aid, he said.



"I'm sorry for the family. That's all I can say," Santos told NBC 6.



Families like the Davidsons will now have to explain the violence to their children. It's a Father's Day marred by tragedy.



"I can't believe the day went from a good Father's Day to a bad day," he said.



The next step for police is to interview the victims at the hospital as they try to determine a motive for the violence.
