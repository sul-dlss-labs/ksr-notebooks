SEALE, AL (WTVM) - Shards are all that is left of the ATV Landon Davis and Ryan Kanzler were riding in Saturday morning.

The thirteen-year-old cousins were coming off a dirt road onto County Road 22 also known as Sandfort Road when they collided with a pick-up truck driven by Mark Jolly, a game and fish warden.

We're told the warden was en route to follow up on a complaint about night hunting in that area.

The victims family says the warden was speeding at the time of the crash but officials with the Alabama State Troopers say the initial results in their investigation into who is to blame for the accident prove otherwise.

"The ATV was traveling off of Gallops Road onto County Road 22. It failed to yield to the game and fish vehicle and was subsequently struck by the game and fish vehicle," said Trooper Zachary Harrelson.

The two teens were rushed to the Columbus Medical Center- Kanzler with massive head injuries and Davis with a shattered pelvis.

Sadly, Kanzler passed away from his injuries Sunday night.

While it isn't clear what kind of ATV the teens were driving in at this point in the investigation, Alabama State Troopers say the recommended age to drive most wheelers is 16.

Captain Larry Hicks with the Department of Conservation is the game warden's supervisor. He says both parties involved in the accident are praying for each other during this time of loss.

Officials with the Alabama State Troopers say once their investigation into the accident is complete, their findings will be forwarded to the District Attorney and presented to a grand jury.
