On Monday, March 7, 2016, the New Mexico State Police was contacted to investigate an officer involved shooting incident in Eddy County. The incident occurred around 2:00 p.m. after agents with the Pecos Valley Drug Task Force received information that a wanted Probation and Parole absconder, identified as Daniel Chavez (41) of Carlsbad (pictured below), was at a residence on West Texas Street in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Mr. Chavez had an active Probation and Parole warrant for being an absconder on original charges of Felon in Possession of a Firearm and Possession of Explosives.



Once agents confirmed Mr. Chavez was present at the residence, the task force (comprised of officers and deputies from the Carlsbad Police Department and Eddy County Sheriff’s Department) approached and encountered Mr. Chavez outside the residence. According to statements, Mr. Chavez attempted to flee from agents on foot, then attempted to flee the residence in his vehicle. During his attempt to flee, Mr. Chavez’s vehicle struck a police vehicle.



Shots were fired by agents of the Pecos Valley Drug Task Force and Mr. Chavez was fatally struck by gunfire. Mr. Chavez was transported to the Carlsbad Medical Center where he was pronounced deceased.



All details of this incident are being investigated by the New Mexico State Police Investigations Bureau. The names of the officers involved will not be released until interviews have been conducted.
