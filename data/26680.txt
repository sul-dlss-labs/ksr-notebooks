NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. (WCSC) - The Dorchester County Coroner identified the Charleston man who died in a crash early Saturday morning after a pursuit with North Charleston Police.

Diedreich Adam Jackson, 37, died from injuries he sustained in a crash on Dorchester Road near St. Georges Episcopal Church at approximately 2:20 a.m. after the chase, Dorchester County Coroner Paul Brouthers said.

Shortly after 2 a.m. Saturday, police saw a man stumbling as he walked toward a vehicle in a parking lot in the area of Ashley Phosphate Road and Dorchester Road, according to North Charleston Police spokesman Spencer Pryor.

The man left the parking lot in a Chevrolet Impala, turning right on Ashley Phosphate Road and then right on Dorchester Road, hitting the concrete buffer, Pryor said.

Police say the vehicle then kept going westbound on Dorchester Road accelerating at a high rate of speed. The officer attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the driver of the vehicle but he fled from police, Pryor said.

Police say the officer lost sight of the vehicle on Dorchester Road but later found it wrecked into the wood line in the 9100 block of Dorchester Road.

The driver had been ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene, Pryor said.

The South Carolina Highway Patrol is investigating the incident.
