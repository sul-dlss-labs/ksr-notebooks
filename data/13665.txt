An Orlando man accused of fleeing from state troopers earlier this month, crashing his car in San Carlos Park and killing his passenger in the process was released from the hospital and arrested Thursday.

Shannon Omar Mitchell, 27, is facing charges of vehicular homicide, fleeing to elude with death, possession of cocaine and driving while license suspended with death.

Kyla Dion Nesmith, 40, was a passenger in the 1997 Chevrolet Cavalier that Mitchell was driving on Nov. 6, according to a Florida Highway Patrol report. Around 3 p.m., troopers were attempting to pull over the car near U.S. 41 and Broadway Avenue for a tinted windows violation when it sped north, drove over a raised median and flipped over on its roof south of Sanibel Boulevard.

The Chevrolet also hit a 2005 Toyota Tacoma as it flipped. The driver of the Toyota was not seriously injured.

Nesmith was pronounced dead at the scene. Mitchell was transported to the hospital in critical condition.
