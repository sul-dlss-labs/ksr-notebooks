FORT WAYNE, Ind. (WANE) — A man killed after a police chase ended in a crash at the intersection of Coliseum Boulevard and Vance Avenue early Friday morning.

Police were called to a domestic dispute around 3:45 a.m. near the 2600 block of Kenwood Avenue.

Once the Fort Wayne Police Department arrived on scene, the male had already left the scene.

While police were still there, the man arrived back to the scene and left again at a high rate of speed.

A short police chase began. Officers terminated the pursuit and were a few blocks away when they saw the car crash at the intersection.

A box truck was traveling north on Coliseum Blvd. when the car collided with the side of the truck at a high rate of speed.

Officers were quickly on the scene. Once medics arrived the male driver was pronounced dead on the scene.

The Allen County Coroner’s Office identified the man as 29-year-old Joshua Michael Kirchhoff of Fort Wayne. An autopsy found Kirchhoff died of multiple blunt force injuries due to a motor vehicle crash and his death was ruled accidental.

According to court documents, Kirchhoff pleaded guilty to a felony domestic battery charge in January 2020 in Allen Superior Court. A judge sentenced him to over a year in prison, but suspended the sentence to adult probation only.

The driver of the box truck is in good condition.

This is an ongoing investigation.
