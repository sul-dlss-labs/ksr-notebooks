Anthony Alvarez, 25, is holding his female cousin’s 16-month-old baby boy, Michael Pittman Jr., hostage inside a downstairs apartment in the Arden Towne complex between Arden and Wright street in Sacramento.

According to his sister, Tessa Alvarez, her brother suffers from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She said her brother was not taking his antipsychotic medication which helps him to not hear voices. In addition, she offered to go inside the apartment to get her brother to surrender, but that was deemed too dangerous.

According to Sacramento County Sheriff Department Sgt. Tim Curran, there was a number of gunfire exchanges between the suspect and police, but it was not yet determined if Alvarez was hit. A sniper fired at Alvarez at 9 a.m. but missed.

According to police and the SWAT team, they have not heard any noise for several hours regarding the toddler. At this point it cannot be determined if the baby is still alive.

Alvarez is also wanted in connection with three bank robberies in the Bay Area, a shooting at an officer in Concord during a traffic stop and a possible homicide in San Francisco.

Alvarez’s sister stated on KCRA Channel 3 that the family loves him and wants him to know that they are in this together and “will get through this, and everything will be OK.”
