NEPHI — Police have identified a 21-year-old man who they say was killed in a rollover crash after a high-speed pursuit on I-15 Saturday night.

Utah Highway Patrol officials said Kaden Christen, of Orem, was killed in the crash while fleeing from officers.

UHP said troopers attempted to pull Christen over for a traffic violation on northbound I-15 at milepost 207 near Yuba Lake State Park at around 5 p.m. Saturday. That’s when UHP said Christen fled, leading troopers on a high-speed pursuit that lasted about 10 minutes.

The pursuit ended when Christen lost control of his vehicle and rolled over the median and into the southbound lane. Christen was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash and a female passenger was transported to a local hospital in poor condition, police said.

There was no update Sunday on the passenger’s condition.

Officers said Saturday they were unsure why Christen fled and that remains under investigation. The Utah County Sheriff’s Office and the State Bureau of Investigation are handling that investigation.
