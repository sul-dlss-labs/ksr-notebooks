FORREST CITY, AR (KAIT) – The man wanted for a shooting incident in Forrest City and for outstanding charges is dead.

Forrest City police say Antonio Mario Rogers, 21, has died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Rogers was wanted for aggravated assault following a shooting incident on the 100 block of Tennessee Street on Oct 12 and for outstanding charges with the St. Francis County Sheriff's Office.
