An off-duty California Highway Patrol officer is suspected of shooting two people, including his wife, before turning the gun on himself at a Martell nutrition store late Monday night, the Amador County Sheriff's Office said.Deputies were called to Get Ripped Nutrition on Prospect Drive just before 10:45 p.m. The caller said he was inside the business with a woman and her husband was banging on the door trying to get in. The caller also said the husband was a CHP officer.A deputy responded to the scene 11 minutes later and heard gunshots. The arriving officer found two people dead and a third person walking around with a gunshot injury to his shoulder. The 44-year-old man who survived was the owner of the store and the one who had called 911.Witnesses told detectives that the husband, off-duty CHP Officer Brad Wheat, 45, fired a gun at the store window in order to get inside, the Sheriff's Office said. Once inside, there was a struggle between Wheat, his wife, Mary Wheat, and the store's owner. The store's owner was shot inside the business and the struggle spilled out into the parking lot. The Sheriff's Office said Brad Wheat shot and killed his wife before turning the gun on himself.The store's owner was flown to Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento hospital.Amador County Sheriff Martin Ryan said Brad Wheat was with the Jackson CHP office for two years.“He and his wife were both well-known in the community. She was a business owner as well. We have staff here that knew them, (the) community knew them, so it hits people particularly hard,” he said.Ryan said Wednesday that Wheat used his CHP-issued service weapon, a .40 caliber handgun, in the murder-suicide.“The CHP is aware of a shooting incident that occurred Monday night involving an off-duty CHP officer," Chief Brent Newman of CHP's Valley Division said in a statement. "The CHP is fully cooperating with the Amador County Sheriff’s Office, as it investigates the incident, and is conducting its own investigation into what happened. The CHP extends its thoughts and prayers to the families, friends, and colleagues of those involved in this terrible tragedy.” Brad Wheat had been with the CHP 11 years. Mary Wheat was the owner of The Edge CrossFit Performance and Strength Training, where members described her as a happy and motivating coach who did a lot for the community."She was always really encouraging, very nice, focused on good technique and form. She was just a very smiley person," said Sarah Adler.Mary Wheat promoted fitness and her business on a local television station three years ago. Gloria Vallejo, whose family owns El Mira Mar Mexican Restaurant next door to the nutrition shop, said Mary Wheat was a regular. "She was fun. She was outgoing. She was always happy. I know she was an assistant coach to one of my sister's soccer team," she said. "You would never see her sad. She always did 100 percent on everything."Dr. Liseanne Wick, a friend of the family, said the couple leaves behind four children.A small group of chaplains from New Life Foursquare Church gathered outside Get Ripped Nutrition Tuesday to offer mourners a place to sit and talk about what happened Monday night.
