Phenix City police believe they have found a man who stole several cuts of meat from a store last week.

Police say an off duty officer saw a man steal the meat and chased him to a city bridge. The officer saw the man jump into the Chattahoochee River and then lost sight him. The un-known man's body was found in Muscogee County, Georgia on Sunday.

Investigators say several steaks were found in his pants.
