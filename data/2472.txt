A Rialto man facing judgment on multiple counts of child molestation escaped from a San Bernardino County courthouse Tuesday, armed himself and apparently committed suicide after leading sheriff’s deputies on a brief chase in Fontana, authorities said.

The 46-year-old man bolted from the courtroom as jurors were entering to announce their verdict, according to San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman Robin Haynal.

Two deputies chased him into the parking lot, where he got into his truck and tried to run over one of the deputies, Haynal said.

Deputies fired at the vehicle as the man plowed into several parked cars and then sped off, authorities said.

Deputies followed, and they found the truck abandoned about two miles away.

Witnesses told the deputies which way the driver had run, and they found his body in the driveway of a nearby home.

Haynal said he apparently shot himself.

The jury found him guilty.
