A Chicago man who died Saturday after police used a taser gun when he approached them with a homemade knife was identified Sunday as a parolee released from prison just over a week ago, officials said.

An autopsy Sunday by the Cook County medical examiner's office was unable to determine the cause of 39-year-old Homer Taylor's death and said the official results were pending further studies, which can take weeks. Police said it appeared the man ingested narcotics before dying.

Taylor was acting erratic and drinking from an open bottle about 2 p.m. Saturday near North Leclaire Avenue and West Washington Boulevard, police said. As they approached Taylor, he fled, and officers chased him.

"The man was apprehended and became combative with what appeared to be a sharp-edged object, thrashing at officers," Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Monique Bond said. "The subject resisted arrest and was subdued with a taser discharge."

Taylor, who lived in the 300 block of North Central Park Avenue, was released from prison Oct. 10 after being sentenced to two years for convictions on forgery and drug charges, according to public records. Taylor also had several other drug convictions since 1999.

No officers were hurt during the confrontation. The incident was being evaluated by the Independent Police Review Authority.
