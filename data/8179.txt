An armed man who was killed by an undercover Lakewood officer was shot twice in the back, according to an autopsy report.

Eugene Paul Velarde, 25, was shot after he fled a liquor store at West First Avenue and Sheridan Boulevard on June 10.

Police said Velarde entered the store with a pistol and made threats.

A short time later, two Lakewood Police Department plainclothes officers driving an unmarked Nissan Pathfinder tried to pull over Velarde, who was driving a minivan, but Velarde rammed the sport utility vehicle, police said.

Velarde ran from the crash and was shot twice by a pursuing officer.

Investigators found a pistol near Velarde, but they have not said whether he fired any shots at the officers, who have not been identified.

Velarde had several drugs in his blood system, according to the autopsy report, including cocaine, opiates and amphetamine.

According to the autopsy, Velarde was shot twice in the right side of the back from an “intermediate” distance.

The fatal shooting happened in Denver, just across the Lakewood line, and is being investigated by Denver police.

Lakewood police declined comment, deferring to Denver investigators. Denver police declined further comment citing the ongoing investigation.
