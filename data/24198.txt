EARLIER:

Three people were killed and one person is in critical condition after the SUV they were riding in crashed into a tree following a police chase Sunday morning.

The gold SUV matched the description of a vehicle in a break-in call at the Black Arsenal gun shop in Stevensville. Several long guns were stolen from the store.

At around 5:26 a.m., a Berrien County Sheriff's deputy noticed a vehicle matching the description on I-94 near mile marker 27. The vehicle first pulled over to the side of the road, but then sped off eastbound on I-94.

The police chase continued when the vehicle exited on M-139 and turned on Scottsdale Road. The SUV continued south on M-139 and lost control near Rocky Weed Road, where it crashed into a tree.

Police released dashcam video of the chase Sunday afternoon.

The Michigan State Police is leading the investigation into the crash.

The deputies involved have been placed on administrative leave, per standard operating procedures, until an investigation and a review by the Berrien County Prosecutor's Office can take place.
