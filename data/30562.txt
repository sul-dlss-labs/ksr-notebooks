Houston police said the officer was trying to detain the suspect before he was shot

HOUSTON – A suspect was killed during an officer-involved shooting Tuesday evening in southeast Houston, according to the Houston Police Department.

The shooting was reported at 6:30 p.m. at the Villa Paree Apartments, located in the 7500 block of Park Place.

When officers arrived at the apartment complex, a woman said she had been assaulted by a man who was inside of one of the apartment buildings.

Houston Police Chief Troy Finner said when the officers went inside of the apartment to arrest the suspect, a struggle broke out between one of the officers and the suspect.

Officers said a second suspect, who is believed to be related to the man accused of assaulting the woman, intervened and started struggling with the officer as well.

During the altercation, Finner said one of the suspects tried to grab the officer’s gun, which eventually discharged.

A second officer, who was also on the scene, said he feared for his partner’s life and discharged his weapon, shooting the first suspect.

Police said the suspect was pronounced dead on the scene. The second suspect fled from the apartment after the shooting but was later captured and arrested, according to authorities.

Neither officer suffered any major injuries from the altercation, according to Finner.

Both officers were placed on administrative duty.
