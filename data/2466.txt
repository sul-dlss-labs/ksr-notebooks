A 23-year-old fugitive sought in the fatal shooting of one New Jersey police officer and the wounding of another in Bergen County last week was killed in a gun battle with sheriffs' deputies on a sunbaked highway in Florida yesterday after a gunfire-punctuated high-speed chase through two counties, the authorities said.

Three days after Officer Mary Ann Collura was shot dead in Fair Lawn as she went to the aid of the other officer, the hunt for the suspect, Omar Marti, an unemployed printer from Passaic, ended 900 miles away near a hamlet 60 miles northeast of Tampa.

Armed with two handguns and a stash of other weapons, the suspect stepped out of a car that had ground to a halt on its rims, its tires shredded away by roadblock spikes after a wild 20-mile chase through west-central Florida, and in a final act of defiance opened fire at six Hernando and Sumter County deputies who were closing in.

Shooting from behind the car until his .44 Magnum and .380 automatic were empty, Mr. Marti threw the guns down and raised his hands, as if to surrender, said Michael Mordaga, chief of detectives for the Bergen County prosecutor's office, who coordinated the manhunt and was in on its final moments.
