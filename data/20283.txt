A 54-year-old man died after being stunned with a Taser and struggling with sheriff’s deputies in Lemon Grove Saturday, authorities said.

When paramedics got to him, he fell unconscious and stopped breathing. They performed CPR on the way to a hospital, but the man, identified as Mark Adkins, died a few hours later, sheriff’s homicide Lt. Kenn Nelson said.

Several residents on Lemon Grove Way called 911 about 8:15 a.m. to report a black man jumping fences into the backyards and trying to get into townhomes. The callers said the man did not live there, Nelson said.

They also said the man, 5 feet 10 inches to 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, was acting as if he was under the influence of drugs, Nelson said.

Two deputies came across the man in a patio shared by residents of the complex. They ordered him several times to get on the ground, but he refused and appeared agitated, Nelson said.

Both deputies fired their Tasers at the man at 8:26 a.m. He fell to the ground but kept trying to stand while the deputies told him to stay down. One or both deputies shot him again with a Taser. Nelson said the Tasers will be examined to confirm how many times they were fired, and how many barbs connected with the man.

Nelson said deputies wrestled with the man until they got him handcuffed and did not use any other weapons, such as batons, on him.

Deputies told investigators the man was alert and kept struggling until paramedics got there, at 8:35 a.m. The medics started treating him, then he became unresponsive, Nelson said.

The man died at the hospital shortly before noon. His name has not been released.
