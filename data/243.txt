Officials acknowledged Thursday that a man was shot to death more than 24 hours earlier in a confrontation with Livingston and Park County officers, but they wrapped most of the case in secrecy.

A brief official statement left most major questions unanswered, including whether it was the officers — one or both — who shot the man.

Police Chief Steve McCann said no further information would be released until the investigation is complete and that may take several weeks.

Park County Attorney Tara DePuy sealed the investigation file.

Coroner Al Jenkins refused to comment except to say no officers were injured.

The dead man was identified as Bradley Harlan Pingree, 33, but the statement did not say if he lived in the trailer park where the shooting occurred, and it did not give any further information about him.

The statement said Pingree escaped from a patrol vehicle and was shot to death about 4:45 a.m Wednesday when he pointed a rifle at a Livingston police officer.

The statement did not explain circumstances of Pingree’s arrest, how he escaped or how he got a rifle.

“The city officer was backing up a Park County deputy sheriff in the Windmill Trailer Park regarding a complaint of Mr. Pingree walking around the trailer court with a loaded gun that he had fired earlier in the morning,” the statement said.

The trailer court is just outside the Livingston city limits.

The statement did not say how many times Pingree was wounded or when he died, or whether anyone else witnessed the shooting.

The statement also did not identify the officers. Police dispatch records, however, showed Deputy Sheriff Denver Cobb called for backup from the Windmill Trailer Park at 3:40 a.m. Wednesday and Livingston police officer Thomas Totland responded.

The Montana Division of Criminal Investigations is investigating the shooting, the statement said.
