EAST ORANGE

â€” A 32-year-old East Orange man was shot and killed by a city police officer this morning after he was allegedly found stabbing his father-in-law, officials said.

Around 7:30 Monday morning, East Orange police responded to reports of a stabbing in the 400 block of Norwood Avenue, according to Katherine Carter, a spokeswoman for the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. The officers found Karlando Roberts holding a knife and stabbing his father-in-law, according to Carter.

After Roberts refused to drop the knife, an officer fired two shots, Carter said. Roberts was rushed to University Hospital where he died a short time later, Carter said. The shooting will be reviewed by the Essex County Prosecutor's Office and sent before a grand jury, which is common practice for all police-involved shootings, she said.

The stabbing victim, whose identity was not-released, suffered non-life threatening injuries, according to Sgt. Andrew Dielmo, an East Orange Police spokesman.

Roberts' death marked the city's second killing in East Orange in the past 24 hours. The two deaths were not connected.

An unidentified thief shot and killed a male employee at the Lukoil station in the 500 block of William Street around 6 p.m. Sunday night, according to Dielmo. The victim's identity was not immediately revealed, and the suspect remains at large, Dielmo said.

Carter did not immediately respond to questions on the gas station homicide.
