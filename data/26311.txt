A 52-year-old man who was reportedly yelling and walking into traffic Tuesday night in Chino Hills was shot and killed by a sheriff’s deputy after the suspect ran at the deputy with two knives, authorities said.

Less-than-lethal rounds had failed to stop the man, they said.

Jose Javier Gonzalez, 52, of Chino Hills, was taken to Pomona Valley Medical Center where he was pronounced dead just before 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, according to a statement from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

Deputies were called to the area of Descanso and Pipeline avenues at 7:47 p.m. Tuesday, July 16, on reports that the man was brandishing a knife as he yelled and walked in and out of traffic.

Pipeline Avenue was closed for the investigation from Tuesday evening until almost 11 a.m. Wednesday.

Gonzalez “appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance,” the statement said, and would not cooperate with deputies, including orders from them to drop the knives.

Gonzalez threatened to kill people, the sheriff’s statement said.
