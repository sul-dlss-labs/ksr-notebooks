Authorities said officers repeatedly ordered the gunman to surrender, but a two-year Metro Police veteran returned fire with his department-issued shotgun. The gunman was shot and pronounced dead at the scene. Police told News 2 that no officers are injured.

Authorities have identified the gunman as a 39-year-old man who was arrested Wednesday for tampering with his electronic monitoring device.

A semi-automatic pistol has been recovered from the scene, but Metro Police said the location needs to be documented. Officials said Old Hickory Boulevard will be shut down for several hours.

Metro police have since released body camera footage of the whole incident.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has also opened a separate investigation into the incident.
