CITRUS HEIGHTS–

Police have identified the men in a deadly officer-involved shooting that stemmed from a car burglary investigation.

Officers responded to a call of a suspicious person at the Glen Alta Drive and Debbie Ann Court intersection around 2 a.m. Thursday.

When an officer arrived, he confronted a man matching a caller’s description of the suspects. Citrus Heights Police say the officer at some point with the suspect feared for his life, and opened fire.

Hunter Jacob Todd, a 20-year-old from Citrus Heights, was the man shot and killed by an officer. The officer feared for his life after Todd looked to be reaching for a weapon. An “edged weapon” was found near where Todd was reaching.

Officers immediately gave him first aid and he was transported to the hospital, but was later pronounced dead.

Richard Martin Duran, a 20-year-old also from Citrus Heights, was in a different car and was arrested by police that morning. He faces numerous charges related to auto theft, plus two bench warrants.
