Stephen Bours, a 30-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police Saturday, March 20, in the 12000 block of Paramount Boulevard in Downey, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Bours was wielding and ax and walking north in the middle of the southbound lanes of Paramount Boulevard about 6:30 p.m., said L.A. County Sheriffâ€™s Capt. Ray Leyva. Officers ordered Bours several times to stop and drop the weapon, but he refused and advanced toward them with the ax raised over his head.

"Fearing for their safety, the officers fired their weapons at the suspect and struck him," Leyva said.

Bours was taken to a hospital in Lynwood where he was pronounced dead at 7:06 p.m., said Ed Winter, a spokesman for the coroner's office.

The hatchet was recovered.
