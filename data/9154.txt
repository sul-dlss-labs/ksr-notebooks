Jose Flores, a 19-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Thursday, May 27, in the 400 block of South Park View Street in Westlake, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Two gang unit officers responded to a call about 7:40 p.m. and tried to stop Flores, who was running by West 6th and South Park View streets near MacArthur Park, said LAPD Officer April Harding.

Officers saw a handgun in the man's hand, and he refused to drop the weapon, Harding said.

“That’s when the officer-involved shooting took place,” Harding said. The officers were not injured, she said.

Flores was pronounced dead at the scene, according to coroner's records.

It's believed Flores was in the middle of an alleged drug deal before he was approached by police, according to KTLA. Police said Flores was a known gang member and parolee.

LAPD officials identified the officers involved in the shooting as Police Officer III Clint Perez and Police Officer II Ryan Nguyen and said both men are 12-year veterans of the department.
