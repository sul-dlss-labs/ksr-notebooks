Police in San Jose, California shot and killed a suspect who hit an officer with his vehicle and dragged him several feet, according to police.

Police were trying to locate a stolen car when the suspect jumped through its sunroof and started behaving erratically, police said. The incident occurred around 12:52 p.m. on Kollmar Drive and Story Road, according to SJPD spokesperson Sgt. Enrique Garcia.

Three officers blocked the vehicle and commanded the suspect to comply. The suspect refused and rammed his vehicle into a patrol car, according to police.

The suspect then drove the vehicle at officers when one officer was struck and dragged with the vehicle and "pinned between the stolen vehicle and a parked vehicle," police said.

The suspect was a known gang member, sources familiar with the investigation told NBC Bay Area. He tried to drive off and hit an officer and dragged him with the vehicle. The officer was taken to the hospital where he's being treated for serious but not life-threatening injury.

All three officers fired at the suspect, hitting him at least once, police said. The unidentified adult male suspect was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The involved officers will be placed on paid administrative leave, SJPD said. The Santa Clara County District Attorney’s Office and the San Jose Police Department’s Homicide Unit are conducting a joint criminal investigation.

Several neighbors say the incident was the third time in a month they've heard gunfire in the area. They say they've seen a lot of police activity on the road.

This is the second officer-involved shooting this year in San Jose. In February, an officer fatally shot a suspect who hijacked a UPS truck.
