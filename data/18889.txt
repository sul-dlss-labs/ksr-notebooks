A Harriman man's death has been ruled a suicide after what officials said was a "suicide-by-cop" attempt.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the 9th District Attorney General released an official report Friday concerning autopsy results and police video footage from the event.

At around 1:30 p.m. Feb. 2, the Rockwood Police Department responded to a call that 58-year old Quentin Swicegood was in the parking lot of the Wal-Mart on North Gateway Avenue in Rockwood and was "possibly suicidal," according to 9th District Attorney General Russell Johnson.

The caller, Quentin's father, Duie Swicegood told police his son may be drunk and armed, was depressed and was threatening suicide or suicide by cop.

Detective Dewayne Gray and Officer Rick Thomas, who wore a body camera, found Swicegood in his vehicle and asked him to step out. Swicegood refused. The report states Thomas noticed Swicegood had a revolver and reached into the driver's side window "in an attempt to get him to release the revolver and/or to put distance between himself and the car."

The report says Swicegood raised the weapon toward Thomas, and Thomas then raised his own.

"Do not reach for it, do not reach for it. Put your hands up, do not aim that," Thomas said.

Both Swicegood and Thomas fired a single shot. One .40 caliber round from Thomas' gun was later found lodged in the vehicle's door. Officers at the scene said Swicegood's shot was not aimed at Thomas.

The autopsy report confirms that Swicegood died by a single .410 caliber round from his own revolver. "No gunshot wound from any other kind of round was noted," the autopsy report states.

The Knox County Regional Forensic Center medical examiner noted alcohol bottles were found at the scene of Swicegood's death in the report, but toxicology results are still pending.
