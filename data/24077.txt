Phoenix police shot and killed a man following a multi-hour pursuit early Saturday.

No officers were hurt in the incident, which ended near 13th Avenue and Thomas Road.

Sgt. Mark Tovar, a Phoenix police spokesman, said officers responded to two separate reports of shots fired near 28th Avenue and Bethany Home Road at approximately 2 a.m. They determined the 39-year-old man was driving a dark-colored car.

Officers located the car at about 3 a.m., and the driver refused to stop for police before he continued into Ahwatukee and then the Scottsdale area, Tovar said. Officers were unable to stop the car with spikes.

The man attempted to steal a car near an off-ramp near the Loops 101 and 202 in Tempe, but the female driver refused to give up her car, Tovar said.

"The suspect also pointed a weapon at a DPS officer at that location," Tovar said.

At some point, the man switched from the dark-colored car to a white minivan. Tovar said he did not know how the man got the minivan, but police do not believe it was a carjacking.

The man then fled the scene, but two of his tires were damaged, Tovar said. He continued west driving on rims before the car came to a stop near 13th Avenue and Thomas Road at approximately 5 a.m.

"He engaged officers," Tovar said. "He did have a weapon. He pointed a weapon at officers."

Officers fired at the man, striking him at least once. Tovar said the man, whose identity was withheld, died at the scene.

Thomas Road was closed Saturday morning between 11th and and 15th avenues. Tovar said the closure was to likely remain in place into the afternoon.

The man was the 25th person to be shot by law enforcement in Maricopa County in 2018 that The Arizona Republic has reported on.
