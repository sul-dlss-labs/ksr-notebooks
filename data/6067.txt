Albany Times Union, NYBy CAROL DeMARE, Staff writerWednesday, April 19, 2007A former Albany cop was shot and killed by Phoenix police Friday after a dispute involving an ex-girlfriend. A similar domestic incident landed him in a New York state prison 11 years ago and ended his law enforcement career. In 1996, Leonard Croskey, then 27 and a patrol officer, pleaded guilty to burglary, admitting he broke into an ex-girlfriend's home. As part of a plea bargain, for which he received a prison term of 1 to 3 years, he resigned from the force... Croskey had been on the Albany force five years.

She was able to talk him into leaving... Phoenix police caught up with him as he was attempting to drive away from his home. During a two-hour standoff, police tried negotiating as Croskey held a gun to his head and threatened suicide. Croskey eventually got out of his car and opened fire on police. Two officers fired back and Croskey was seriously injured and pronounced dead at a hospital... Records at the Albany County jail show Croskey had been held there on at least four separate occasions... On Oct. 27, 1998, after being paroled, Croskey was back behind bars on charges of first-degree burglary, unlawful imprisonment and criminal trespass, jail Superintendent Tom Wigger said Tuesday... and he was turned over to parole officials in May 1999. It is unclear whether he was returned to prison or how the new charges were disposed of. On Aug. 15, 1999, Croskey was again in jail on new charges of burglary, criminal contempt and petit larceny. Two days later, Aug. 17, he was released from custody in Albany City Court...
