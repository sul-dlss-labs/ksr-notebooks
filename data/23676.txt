KALAMAZOO, MI -- Michigan State Police have identified the man who was fatally shot Wednesday while troopers were serving a search warrant.

Troopers from the MSP Marshall Post were executing the search warrant related to a cold case about 11:15 a.m. Jan. 24 in Branch County's Union Township when they came under fire by David Kidney, 62, of Union City, according to a news release.

An autopsy was conducted on Kidney on Thursday morning in Grand Rapids. Preliminary results show Kidney's cause of death to be a single gunshot wound sustained while exchanging gunfire with troopers.

During the incident, officers were attempting to take cover when D/Sgt. Aaron Steensma was shot in the chest and Tpr. Daniel Thayer was shot in the chest and hand.

Steensma, who has been with MSP 19 years, remains in serious but stable condition at Borgess Medical Center in Kalamazoo.

The round that struck Thayer in the chest was stopped by his ballistic vest. Thayer, who has been with MSP 21 years, did not seek medical treatment.

All MSP personnel were wearing body armor at the time of the incident.

The search warrant was connected to an investigation into the 2009 shooting death of Duane Finney. In March of 2017, the Michigan State Police reopened the investigation into Finney's death. He was found shot to death in his car on May 12, 2009.

No further details are available for release at this time, as the investigation is still ongoing.
