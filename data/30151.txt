A wrong-way driver from Fitchburg died after his car veered off of Route 93 in New Hampshire following a police chase early Sunday, authorities said.

Police said they saw David Hartenstein, 39, of Fitchburg traveling northbound on southbound travel lanes and attempted to get him to stop “many times to no avail.”

“The wrong-way driver repeatedly drove at the Troopers and then around them,” New Hampshire State Police said in a report.

Multiple attempts to deflate the car tires were not successful, police said. Police set up rolling roadblocks to stop drivers from encountering the wrong-way driver, according to police.

The driver veered off of the roadway nearly the Route 101 split in Manchester and into the woods. Troopers found Hartenstein’s car a short time later and he was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Troopers were assisted by Raymond Police, Candia Police, Candia Fire Department and the NH DOT.

Anyone with information pertaining to this incident is encouraged to contact New Hampshire State Police at 603-583-3795.
