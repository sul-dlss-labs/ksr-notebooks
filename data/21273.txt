GRAND RAPIDS -- Relatives of a 33-year-old man

shot and killed by a Grand Rapids police officer

Thursday have identified him as Gabriel Desean Hood.

His mother, Cynthia Hood of the Detroit area, spoke briefly today about the 4:30 p.m. shooting on Center Avenue NE near Ann Street.

Police called her today to notify her of his death.

Grand Rapids police say the shooting happened after an officer tried to arrest a man he stopped on a moped, then a struggle ensued and the man fled. At some point, the man pulled out a 9 mm handgun and turned toward the officer after he could not scale a fence.

The officer, still unidentified, ordered the man to drop the weapon, but he did not, police say. The officer fired multiple shots.

Cynthia Hood this morning said she could not say whether police acted properly.

"I don't know what happened, so I don't really know," she said. "I don't think (Gabriel) exchanged any fire. I don't think he did."

Michigan Department of Corrections records show hood served prison time for a 1995 assault with intent to rob while armed conviction and a 1997 conviction for armed robbery, both in Wayne County, and a 2005 conviction for cocaine delivery in Kent County.

He is listed as absconding from parole on Oct. 28, 2009.
