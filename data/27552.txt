NEWBURY (CBS) – State and local police swarmed a gas station in Newbury as the final chapter in a multi-state police chase ended with the suspect being shot and killed by police.

Investigators say the suspect had carjacked or stolen a number of vehicles in recent days. He ended up just off the highway at the A.L.Prime on Central Street, where he was boxed in and allegedly rammed cruisers, leading to a confrontation.

"The officers exited their cruisers, asked the suspect to get out of the car, a weapon was discharged by an officer or more than one officer – that's yet to be determined – first aid was immediately rendered, and the suspect was transported by ambulance to Anna Jacques Hospital, where he was pronounced dead," said Jonathan Blodgett, Essex County District Attorney.

I-Team sources say the suspect held a Nashua, New Hampshire, BMW dealership employee up at knifepoint, stabbing the employee before taking off with the BMW later involved in the shooting in Newbury, Massachusetts. The employee is not believed to be seriously injured.

Several people in the neighborhood across the street said they heard gunfire.

"I was in the kitchen. I heard what I thought was a gunshot. My dog usually freaks, but she went running to the door, so I looked out the window and that's when I saw all the cops over there, and then more cruisers kept coming," said neighbor Terri Bowes. "The cops were at first going on the other side of their vehicles, so I thought, shoot they're hiding. I was gonna hide. It was scary."

Police said the suspect was a 31-year-old male, but they did not release his name. I-Team sources identified the suspect as Thomas Murray of North Andover.

No police were hurt in the incident.
