CUSHING — A Cushing police officer who fatally shot a 20-year-old man during a 15-second confrontation on Aug. 30 has been cleared of wrongdoing by the Payne County district attorney.

Master Sgt. Justin Sappington will not face criminal charges in the shooting of Shawn Allen Hall, who reportedly pointed a firearm at several people before he was shot, a news release from District Attorney Laura Thomas states.

Sappington and Officer Boone Bruggman responded in separate cars to a report of an “unwanted person” in the 500 block of South Little Avenue in Cushing around 2 a.m., according to the release.

Several people were in the front yard of the residence when the officers arrived. Sappington reportedly saw a man, later identified as Hall, look directly at the arriving officers. The man immediately raised his arm, according to the release, and pointed a handgun at the people in the yard.

Sappington and Bruggman exited their vehicles and shouted multiple commands to Hall to drop his weapon, police said, but he made no effort to comply with the orders.

“With no less than six lives in immediate threat of serious bodily harm, Sappington fired one shot, striking Hall in the head,” the release states.

“Hall immediately fell to the ground. He was dead at the scene.”

The entire encounter reportedly took around 15 seconds.

The officers then ran to Hall and secured him with handcuffs, discovering that he was armed with two guns, according to the release.

Sappington was placed on paid leave during the review.

The District Attorney’s Office said it reviewed reports from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation as well as photographs, witness statements and dash-cam footage during its review.
