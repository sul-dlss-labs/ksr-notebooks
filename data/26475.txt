MOUNT VERNON, Wash. â€” Police have identified the man who died after he was tasered by a police officer and struck by a vehicle in Mount Vernon last week.

The Skagit Valley Herald reports 34-year-old Joseph Dorn was running from a Mount Vernon policeman who was trying to talk to him about a reported shoplifting at WalMart.

The responding officer then used his stun gun against Dorn, who fell on the ground and was hit by a vehicle on Freeway Drive.

The officer remains on administrative leave.

The Skagit Multiple Agency Response Team is handling the investigation and the Mount Vernon Police Department is not participating.
