CATSKILL - The state Attorney General's Office of Special Investigation is investigating an incident in which a man who had allegedly put hand sanitizer on his body caught fire when a police officer tasered him.

Jason Jones died Wednesday, 47 days after being taken to Westchester Medical Center's Trauma and Burn Center, where he was initially listed in grave condition.

According to the Attorney General's Office, Jones, 29, whose hometown was not made available, walked into the Village of Catskill Police Department building during the early morning hours on Oct. 30.

According to an account published by the Associated Press following the initial incident, which attributed its information to the Times-Union of Albany, Jones got into a confrontation with officers, who were familiar with him from previous encounters, before he sprayed himself with hand sanitizer and the officer used the taser in an effort to subdue him.

Under state executive law, the Attorney General's Office assesses every incident reported in which a police officer or peace officer, including a corrections officer, might have caused the death of a person by an act or omission.

The officer may be on-duty or off-duty, and the person who died may have been armed or unarmed at the time of the incident. The dead person also may or may not have been in custody or incarcerated.

If the office's assessment indicates an officer caused the death, it then proceeds to conduct a full investigation of the incident.
