A man out on bond from fifth offense drunken driving- in Chippewa County died in a crash that followed a pursuit by Eau Claire police late Thursday.

Eau Claire police would not list the address of Jay G. Alger other than saying he lived in Eau Claire. A court record from June 11 said Alger lived at that time at 19809 County X-Lot 7, Chippewa Falls.

“Alcohol was a factor in this crash,” Eau Claire police said in a press release.

According to police:

Officers saw a reckless driving violation and began chasing a vehicle at 400 Galloway Street at 9:53 p.m. Thursday.

The vehicle continued northbound on Highway 53, near the North Crossing, when officers saw it blow a tire due to erratic driving. The officers then stopped the chase.

Moments later, the vehicle continued northbound and lost control, going into a median and rolling several times.

Alger was ejected and pinned under the vehicle. Officers were able to lift the vehicle off of Alger and pull him out.

Alger was taken to a hospital where he died from injuries from the crash.

His drunken driving case in Chippewa County, stemming from a May 25 incident in Cadott, was scheduled to go back to court Sept. 11.

According to court records, he was also accused in Chippewa County of: first degree-recklessly endangering saftey; fleeing-eluding an officer; possession of THC—second offense; possess drug paraphernalia; obstructing an officer; and driving while revoked—second offense.
