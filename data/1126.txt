The Brooklyn district attorney yesterday hit alleged DWI cop Joseph Gray with a new manslaughter charge for the death of victim Maria Herrera’s baby, despite a city medical examiner’s finding that the child was stillborn and, therefore, not legally a human life.

DA Charles Hynes said he relied on newly obtained medical records and the testimony of seven doctors in reaching his conclusion that the heart of Herrera’s 81/2-month-old son – named Ricardo Nicanol – beat on its own for 12 hours before giving out.

“It was a live baby for 12 hours,” Hynes said.

The DA said doctors stimulated Ricardo’s heart with chemicals to get it going, and that breathing was sustained by a respirator, but “the heartbeat was independent and natural for the 12 hours.”

Ellen Borakove, the medical examiner’s spokeswoman, said, “It’s still our position that the child was stillborn.”

The split raises the possibility that Medical Examiner Charles Hirsch could become a defense witness and face off against Hynes’ top senior prosecutor, Joseph Petrosino, at Gray’s criminal trial.

Herrera, her son, Andy, 4, and sister, Dilcia Peña, 16, were killed on Aug. 4 when Gray, who cops say was driving drunk, struck the family on Third Avenue in Brooklyn.

Herrera’s mother, Maria Peña, cheered Hynes’ decision.

“It was the right thing to do,” she told The Post.

Victor Herrera, Maria’s widowed husband, said through his lawyer, Oscar Herasme, that he’s also very satisfied.

But Gray’s attorney, Harold Levy, dismissed the new indictment as a public-relations ploy.

“It doesn’t change the case,” he said.

Following Dominican Republic tradition, Peña’s family gathered last night to mark the first-month anniversary of the deaths.

“I’m happy because the family is coming together to pray for my daughters and grandsons,” Peña said.With additional reporting by Ikimulisa Sockwell-Mason, Joe Cunningham and Brad Hunter.
