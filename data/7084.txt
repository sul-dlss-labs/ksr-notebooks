A San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputy on Thursday morning shot and killed a motorist suspected of trying to ram the officer’s car after a lengthy pursuit, officials said.

The driver, whose name and age have not been released, apparently fled after deputies tried to stop him at Garden and Pacific streets in San Bernardino about 4 a.m., said Arden Wiltshire, spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

Witnesses later reported a car driving erratically in Fontana, and deputies again pursued the man, Wiltshire said. About 5 a.m., the motorist made a U-turn on Mountain Avenue near the 210 Freeway overpass near Upland and began ramming the deputy’s car, Wiltshire said.

The deputy responded by firing at the suspect, Wiltshire said.

It was unclear how many shots were fired and how many struck the driver, who was wounded and crashed into a concrete sound wall, Wiltshire said.

Caltrans workers later recovered a gun from the Waterman interchange at the215 and 10 freeways, authorities said.

No deputies were injured in the pursuit or shooting.
