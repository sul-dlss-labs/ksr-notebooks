Clinton woman killed in apparent murder-suicide by boyfriend

A Clinton woman was shot and killed as she left work at Clinton’s Mercy Medical Center early Sunday morning, about a quarter past midnight. Clinton Police Chief Brian Guy says the bleeding body of 30-year-old Michelle Proud was found in her car in the hospital parking lot, where she died minutes later. After some quick investigative work, Guy says it became apparent the woman’s boyfriend, 36-year-old Mark Moeller of Clinton, was the prime suspect in the shooting. Police tracked down Moeller, which led to a five-hour standoff on a rural road near the town of Tornoto. Clinton County Sheriff’s deputy Kevin Cain says they talked with Moeller for some time. They reached Moeller on his cell phone about 1:30 A.M. but lost contact about 6:40 A.M. A team was sent in and found him dead in his car of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Donna Oliver, president and C-E-O of Mercy Hospital in Clinton, says Proud had worked there as a radiation technician and the incident happened as she left right after her shift. There’s been counseling for staff members to help them cope with the violence. Police say the motive for the slaying is still unclear and there are no other suspects.
