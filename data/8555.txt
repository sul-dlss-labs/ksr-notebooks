A Bay Shore teenager admitted Monday at Suffolk County court to trying to rob an off-duty Nassau County police officer three months ago.

Amille Moore, 16, and his alleged accomplice, Eric Johnson of Bay Shore, tried to rob the officer at the Bubble Brush Car Wash on Lincoln Avenue in Deer Park in the early morning hours of October 27, Suffolk prosecutors said.

Moore pleaded guilty to attempted first-degree robbery before Judge Gary Weber. Moore told the judge that Johnson attacked the officer with an aluminum baseball bat, repeatedly hitting him even after the victim identified himself as a police officer.

The officer fired four shots, striking Johnson once. Johnson died at Southside Hospital.

The incident came an hour and a half after an off-duty New York City Police officer shot a man who Nassau police said tried to carjack the officer at knifepoint 30 miles away in Elmont.

Moore will be sentenced to 5 years in prison on February 23.
