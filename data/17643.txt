The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has identified the man who killed himself at a Tempe complex on Wednesday after being confronted by detectives about Saturday's drive-by shooting of a sheriff's deputy.

Robert Walesa, 51, took his own life Wednesday, according to a statement from the sheriff's office.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio said Wednesday that the then-unidentified Walesa had a criminal record. Walesa pleaded guilty of stalking in 2000 and was incarcerated for 13 months in the Arizona Department of Corrections, according to DOC and Maricopa County Superior Court records.

He was restored the right to possess a firearm in May 2004, according to Superior Court records.

Walesa used a rifle to shoot himself when confronted by detectives at his residence near the Loop 101 and University Drive and was pronounced dead at the scene, Sheriff Joe Arpaio said during a news conference Wednesday. Investigators suspected Walsea and had wanted to question him, but were not 100 percent sure he was the shooter, Arpaio said.

The sheriff said that MCSO had traced Walesa to his residence though surveillance of an older-model silver or gray Cadillac that was suspected to have been used in the drive-by shooting of Deputy Bryan Wisda. Both incidents occurred within blocks of each other near Price Road.

Walesa was pulled over and cited for impaired driving by another deputy working with a DUI-enforcement task force in Tempe on Friday night, Arpaio said. He added Walesa was not driving a Cadillac at the time and was sent home in a cab.

Sheriff's detectives believe he and possibly others returned to the scene in a Cadillac and fired the shots that struck Wisda.

On Wednesday investigators were still trying to piece together what happened Saturday morning and whether others might have been involved in the drive-by. Several guns were recovered and seized at Walesa's residence, Arpaio said.
