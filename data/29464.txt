A man is a dead of an apparently self-inflicted wound and a woman injured after East Anchorage gunfire late Thursday drew a SWAT response, police said.

Officers first responded to a report of gunfire about 8:30 p.m. at a residence in the 4500 block of Seventh Avenue near the Cartee ballfields off Pine Street, according to an online police alert.

Arriving officers found a woman with a non-life-threatening wound in the upper body; she was transported to a hospital. Officers learned that the suspect, a family member of the woman, was inside the residence, police said.

“Officers formed a perimeter around the house, at which time they heard a single gunshot from inside the residence,” police said in the alert.

A SWAT team and crisis negotiators were called to the scene but negotiators were unable to make contact with the suspect, police said.

“SWAT entered the home and located the suspect, who was deceased from an apparent self-inflicted injury,” police said.

Police said at 1:20 a.m. that an investigation was continuing at the scene.
