Two officers who shot and killed an off-duty Cook County correctional officer acted within Chicago Police Department guidelines, according to a department investigation released Thursday.

The officers responded to a call about a man with a gun in the 8800 block of South Yale Avenue around 12:15 p.m. Wednesday and found Donald Motley, 51, inside his home with a 13-inch knife and self-inflicted stab wound to his chin, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

When Motley refused to drop the knife and instead raised it in a threatening manner, the officers fired three shots, hitting him once in the chest and shoulder, Camden said.

Motley, a 22-year corrections veteran, was taken to Christ Medical Center, Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead Thursday at 12:02 a.m., a Cook County medical examiner's office spokesman said.

The department ruled that the officers acted properly because their lives were in danger.

County corrections officials said they did not know of any work-related problems involving Motley and said there "weren't any disciplinary problems with him," said Bill Cunningham, spokesman for the sheriff's police.

In February, Motley took a position in a drug-treatment program for inmates nearly ready for release, Cunningham said.
