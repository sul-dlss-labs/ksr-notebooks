BIRMINGHAM, Alabama - Authorities on Monday released the identity of a woman killed following a police chase that started in Homewood and ended in Birmingham.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the woman as Bristina Jannecia Fuller, 28. Fuller, of Birmingham, was the driver of the car that fled from police.

She was killed Saturday night. Homewood officers responded to a shoplifting call at the Babies "R" Us near Lakeshore Drive at around 7:30 p.m., where they received a description of two women and the vehicle they used to get away, a Chevrolet Tahoe.

Officers tried to stop the SUV, but Fuller didn't stop. A chase followed, and police said the women were throwing stolen items out of a window as the pursuit continued.

"The suspects in the vehicle were driving so fast that the officers decided to back off and end the pursuit," said Homewood Sgt. Andrew Didcoct.

The women, however, continued to drive "recklessly" said Didcoct. When they reached the intersection of Lakeshore Drive and West Oxmoor Road, the driver ran a red light, lost control of the vehicle, hit a van and a utility pole.

Both women were thrown from the SUV, said Didcoct. Fuller was pronounced dead on the scene. The other woman was transported to a local hospital. The second woman's name has not been released.

Alabama court records do not indicate any prior criminal arrests for Fuller.
