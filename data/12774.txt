Today a judge approved a settlement in a case that's caused one family a lot of grief. It involves a deadly police chase that claimed the life of an innocent driver, a mother on her way home from work.

Mother’s Day 2013, Rachael Kamin, a nurse, was on her way home from her shift when a suspect crashed into her. Kamin did not survive the injuries she sustained from the crash.

Robert Gellatly with the Luvera Law Firm represented Kamin’s family.

“There’s no doubt that Joseph Strange was in the wrong, criminally in the wrong,” said Gellatly.

Strange, who was fleeing in a truck, was running from Bothell Police Officer Mark Atterbury. The chase allegedly started in Bothell over a stolen license plate.

A Commanding Officer terminated the chase, but a short time later, a second chase began after Strange hit a car in a parking lot, according to court documents.

The second chase reached speeds estimated at 90 miles per hour, and entered Everett where Strange collided with Kamin. Injuries from the crash claimed her life days later.

After an investigation, Bothell's Police Chief found the danger created by the pursuit outweighed the necessity. The city agreed to a $3 million settlement with Kamin’s family.

According to Bothell Police, the department was in the process of revising their pursuit policy before the 2013 police chase. Stricter rules kicked in the month after Kamin’s death.
