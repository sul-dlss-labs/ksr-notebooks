Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly concluded yesterday that the fatal shooting of a car-theft suspect by officers in the Bronx on Sunday, moments after the man had wrested a gun from another officer and shot him in the abdomen, was justified, the Police Department said in a statement.

The police identified the dead man as Thomas Cipolla, 28, of Shoreham, N.Y. Law enforcement officials said Mr. Cipolla had been arrested nine times since 1996, mostly on charges of criminal possession of stolen property -- a crime for which he was sentenced in 1999 to more than three years in state prison -- and twice for resisting arrest.

Mr. Cipolla was released from prison in December, according to state records.

In Shoreham, on Long Island, Mr. Cipolla's family refused to talk to reporters gathered outside the small two-story house on North Country Road where, according to the police, he lived with his parents.

After being briefed yesterday, Mr. Kelly concluded that the shooting, as well as one on Saturday in which the police said a gunman was wounded in the Bronx, had been justified, the department's chief spokesman, Deputy Commissioner Paul J. Browne, said in a brief statement.
