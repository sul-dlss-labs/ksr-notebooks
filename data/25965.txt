A suspect who tried to flee police on an all-terrain vehicle before getting into a fight with an officer was shot and killed in Wheeler County on Thursday, the GBI said.

Around 1:15 p.m., deputies and officers with the Oconee Drug Task Force tried to serve a warrant to the person in the 100 block of Dry Branch Road in Glenwood, the GBI said in a news release.

The suspect allegedly drove away on a four-wheeler into the woods, leading officers on a brief chase. The person then got into a “physical altercation” with an officer before being shot and killed, the release said.

The officer suffered minor injuries, the release said.

No names have been released.
