A car racing down the wrong way of a Detroit street nearly hits a police car then hit a tree, killing two people.

Police say the driver was seriously wounded before the crash at Archdale and Pilgrim streets just before midnight Thursday.

Neighbors on Detroit's west side can only describe it as terrifying.

"Right in my yard," said Monique. "It was shocking. It sounded like an 18-wheeler ... was just flipping."

Residents ran out of their homes just after midnight to find a burning car and a man and woman both dying.

"it took them a long time to get him out," said Payson Shiver. "They got her out right away. He was tangled all up. It was just awful."

Detroit police saw a man driving a 2015 Dodge Challenger the wrong way on McNichols and tried to pull him over. Instead he began speeding down Archdale running over at least five lawns, tree stumps and a light pole before smashing into a tree.

Sources say the driver had been shot twice.

One neighbor captured the speeding car on a home surveillance camera handing it over to police Friday says it looked like the driver was going at least 90 miles per hour.



While Detroit police work to identify the families of the two victims and investigate the crash. Neighbors looking at the damage say they are glad no one else was hurt.
