A 57-year-old man who told authorities he'd killed his girlfriend was shot to death by SWAT officers during a standoff on the northwest side late Friday, officials said.

Tim Debeau called 911 around 9 p.m. to say he'd killed Yolanda Pronko, 53, said Deputy Jason Ogan, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokesman.

When deputies arrived at his house, in the 4200 block of West Pyracantha Drive, near West Cortaro Farms and North Thornydale roads, Debeau refused to come out and barricaded himself inside, Ogan said.

The Pima Regional SWAT team was called, eventually deploying a robot into the home to try to contact Debeau. SWAT officers, using the robot, saw Pronko inside, dead from "obvious signs of trauma," Ogan said.

Debeau came out a short time later carrying a hammer in one hand and a knife in the other, Ogan said. After he made "aggressive movements" toward SWAT officers, the officers fired, Ogan said.

"They felt threatened and used deadly force," Ogan said. "Even if (suspects are) 30 feet away, by time you get your gun, they're already on top of you."

Arizona Revised Statutes states the use of deadly force by law enforcement officers is justified if they're defending themselves or another person from the use or imminent use of deadly physical force.

Debeau was shot several times and then taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. It wasn't immediately clear how many times he was shot.

The Sheriff's Department did not release the name of the deputy or deputies who shot Debeau.

The Pima County Attorney's Office will investigate the shooting, as is standard for officer-involved shootings.
