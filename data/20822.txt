CANTON TOWNSHIP (AP) A Farmington Hills man was charged yesterday with first-degree murder in an accident that killed an 8-year-old boy during a police pursuit.

John Steven Moffitt, 38, also was arraigned by District Judge John MacDonald on charges of receiving and concealing stolen property over $1,000 and being a habitual third-time offender. The murder charge carries a mandatory life sentence upon conviction.

Authorities allege Moffitt was being pursued by Canton Township police Saturday night when he crashed the 1988 Chevy truck he was driving into a car, killing 8-year-old Travis Miles, of Garden City.

The chase began after police responded to a call of a larceny in progress at a home construction site in the western Wayne County community.

Police stopped two trucks that appeared to be loaded with construction material. Virgil Dale Cagle, 47, and Gary Foreman, 43, both of Detroit, were arrested at the construction site without incident.

But Moffitt and passenger Joseph Walter Respondek, 43, of Detroit, sped away after an officer asked them for identification, authorities said. Moffitt allegedly struck a Canton officer and continued heading east into Westland. Police say he reached speeds of 60 mph before running a red light and broadsiding the car carrying Travis.

The Memorial Elementary School third-grader was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman driving the car suffered minor injuries.

“The best part of my life was ripped from my chest,” the victim”s father, Donald Miles, told the Detroit Free Press. “He”s something that can never be replaced.”
