The man reported to be wielding a hammer who was shot to death by Riverside County sheriff’s deputies on Saturday was identified Monday, Nov. 16, as Ramon Salazar, 31.

The Riverside County Coroner’s Office said Salazar lived in Hemet.

Salazar was shot about 10 a.m. at the Subway restaurant at the corner of 30th Street and Rubidoux Avenue in the Rubidoux area of Jurupa Valley.

The owner of the Subway, who declined to give his name, said that just before the shooting, employees called him to say a man was outside the store breaking things with a hammer. Shortly after, employees called back to say the man was in the store. At that point, the employees ran to the back of the building.

Deputies responding to an unknown-trouble call encountered Salazar, who refused to drop the hammer, a sheriff’s news release said. Deputies fired a Taser in attempt to incapacitate Salazar, but the weapon was ineffective for reasons that were not described.

Salazar then charged toward the deputies, the release said, and they shot him.

The deputies were placed on administrative leave per department policy.

Anyone with information on the incident is asked to call Investigator Gonzalez at the Jurupa Valley station at 951-955-2600 or Investigator Paz at the Central Homicide Unit at 951-955-2777.
