BOONVILLE, Ind. â€” Police say a man is dead after an officer-involved shooting.

Boonville Police officers were dispatched to Governor Boon Square apartments early Friday morning after receiving a 911 call of a man threatening a group of people with knives, according to a release from the department.

Upon arrival at the apartments, officers found a man armed with two large knives. Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Lockyear identified the man as 58-year-old Marshall Coleman of Boonville.

When Coleman reportedly refused to drop the knives, an officer fired his Taser at Coleman several times. When that had no effect, the second officer shot Coleman with his service weapon.

Officers on-scene performed first aid before paramedics arrived, according to Indiana State Police Sgt. Todd Ringle. Coleman was taken to an Evansville hospital where he was declared dead at 2:03 a.m. Friday.

A second release by State Police indicates the 911 call that initiated the run was made from Coleman's cell phone. Police believe Coleman made the call to initiate a confrontation with police. When officers arrived, they didn't see anyone else outside, and no other tenants reported being threatened or injured.

The Boonville City Police officers who responded to the incident were named as Lt. Mark Hadley and Patrolman Trevor Winters. Both officers were placed on administrative leave until at least Monday.

Lockyear said the autopsy determined Coleman died from multiple gunshots to the torso.
