OKLAHOMA CITY – Oklahoma City police have released new details in a deadly officer-involved shooting.

Just before 11:30 p.m., Oklahoma City police responded to a disturbance call at the On Cue near Reno and MacArthur.

Police say the calling party reported that the suspect had a knife and a lighter and was attempting to cut the hoses at the gas pumps and acting like he was going to cut his own throat.

Witnesses later told police the suspect had a knife and screwdriver in his hands and was chasing people in the parking lot.

When officers arrived, they found the suspect, now identified as 35-year-old Jacob Mohow, with a screwdriver and knife.

According to Oklahoma City police, verbal commands were given to Mohow to drop the weapons. Mohow did not follow orders and Officer Jared Tipton used a bean bag shotgun and Officer Grant Wheeler used his Taser.

Police say Mohow remained noncompliant and continued to charge at officers.

That’s when Sgt. Donald Koger discharged his firearm, striking the suspect. Mohow was pronounced dead at the scene.

None of the officers involved in the incident were injured.

Sgt. Koger, who has 9.5 years of service, has been placed on paid administrative leave.

Anyone with information should call the Homicide Tip Line at (405) 297-1200.
