ArrowRight Prosecutors said the transit officer, whose name was not released, was acting in self-defense when the officer fatally shot Sidney Washington Jr., 21, of Northeast Washington.

Prosecutors said officers were deployed to the Metro station about 10:30 p.m. July 4 for a call about two rival gangs in the area setting off fireworks at each other.

According to an investigation, the detective, sitting in an unmarked police car, watched Washington, armed with a ­silver-colored handgun, shoot at a large crowd of people about 50 to 75 feet away. The detective, behind the wheel of the vehicle, pulled the car up next to Washington and yelled “police.” Instead of surrendering, prosecutors say, Washington turned toward the detective and shot at the vehicle, striking the driver’s side of the car door at least twice.

The detective then returned fire, striking Washington and knocking him to the ground. Prosecutors said that while on the ground, Washington fired additional rounds at the officer. The officer returned fire again.

A .45-caliber pistol was found near Washington's body. Authorities also recovered nine .45-caliber cartridge casings from where Washington was seen firing the weapon. An autopsy revealed Washington was shot nine times.

Washington had worked at Reagan National Airport, where he refueled planes, his father has said.
