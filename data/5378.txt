Sheriff Herbie Johnson confirmed to WSFA 12 that his veteran deputy, Micah Burks, died Wednesday evening from injuries he received in a weekend car crash.

Family and friends had been holding on to hope for five days that Sgt. Burks would pull through. However, doctors at Baptist South pronounced Burks deceased around 6:30 p.m. Wednesday evening.

Deputy Micah Burks was on patrol along Highway 31 in Pine Level Saturday when another car crossed the median and collided with his. Theresa Benton and her 13 year old grandson, Joshua Benton-- both passengers in the other car-- died on the scene.

Burks was transported to the hospital with serious head injuries and died while in ICU. Sgt. Burks was a 14-year veteran of the sheriff's office, named officer of the year in 1999. Sheriff Johnson says he will be missed.

"I just want to thank the family for letting me have Micah to work for me for 14 years and being my friend, co-worker, a good officer. It meant a lot to me and he means a lot to the department. We're all just sad at this time, very, very sad," says Sheriff Johnson.

Burks' death does change the nature of the accident investigation. So far, the driver who caused the accident hasn't been charged with anything, but District Attorney Randall Houston will be presenting a case to the grand jury so charges may be pending.

This marks the first time an Autauga County deputy was killed in the line of duty in nearly twenty years. Burks was only 16 months away from retirement.

Prattville mayor, Jim Byard, says all flags at city buildings will be flown at half staff until Burks' funeral. The mayor is also extending prayers and sympathies to the Burks family and to all members of the Autauga County Sheriff's Department.
