Autopsy results were released today for a bank robbery suspect who died during a gunfire-fueled chase on Interstate 83 Friday afternoon.



Robert Lee, 44, of Harrisburg, died from a gunshot wound, according to Cumberland County Coroner Mike L. Norris.



Lee was found dead in the vehicle that crashed near the Lowther Street exit off I-83 after the bank robbery in York County and subsequent police chase, the coroner wrote in a press release.

State police are still searching for the second of three men suspected in the robbery of the People's Bank in West Manchester Twp., York County, about 12:30 p.m. Friday. They were pursued northbound on I-83 by officers from multiple agencies.



The suspects and officers exchanged gunfire during the chase, police said. Two police cars crashed near the New Cumberland exit, and the suspects' vehicle crashed near the Highland Park exit.



Lee was pronounced dead at the scene. The autopsy results released by Norris did not indicate who may have fired the shots that killed Lee.



Another suspect was taken into custody. Shaun Damon Mcarthur, 35, of Harrisburg, has been charged with carrying a firearm without a license, theft, terroristic threats and reckless endangerment, police said.



The third suspect escaped into the Lemoyne area, prompting an afternoon-long search that closed roads and locked down schools.
