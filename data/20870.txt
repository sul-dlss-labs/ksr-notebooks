Authorities in Colfax County say a suspect in the death of a Schuyler man on Tuesday shot himself to death Friday evening as law enforcement closed in on him in the 700 block of E Street in Schuyler.

Authorities did not immediately identify the suspect in the case but they say he was being sought in connection with the death of Janner Ramon Torres-Diaz, 33, on June 27th.

Investigators developed a person of interest based on witness accounts and obtained an arrest warrant on Friday afternoon.

The Nebraska State Patrol SWAT Team was activated and authorities set up a perimeter around his the E Street location.

According to a news release from Colfax County Attorney Denise Kracl, as authorities began to move in they heard a noise believed to have been a gunshot followed minutes later by another.

A State Patrol robot was sent in and confirmed that the suspect was dead as the result of a self-inflicted shooting.
