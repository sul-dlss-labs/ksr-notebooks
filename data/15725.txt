A Pinal County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed a knife-wielding man Friday night, department officials said.

The dead man was identified as 37-year-old Daniel Mejia of San Manuel, and family members told detectives that he suffered from severe mental-health issues, officials said.

The deputy responded to a 911 call around 8:30 p.m. Friday after a woman reported that a suspicious person had confronted her husband outside their home near the 200 block of South McNab Parkway in San Manuel, according to Tim Gaffney, director of administration for the department.

The woman said that the man had "squared off show-down style" with her husband while swinging a knife. He walked toward a wooden light pole and began to "stab, shave and slit" it before leaving on foot, Gaffney said.

When the deputy arrived, he found Mejia near a local market with a knife in his hand.

After being told to drop the knife, Mejia walked toward the deputy with knife in hand and said he was going to harm him, Gaffney said

Fearing for his safety, the deputy, who has yet to be identified, pulled out his department issued weapon and told Mejia to stay back. After ignoring repeated verbal warnings, the deputy shot and killed Mejia, officials said.

Gaffney said Mejia was about 7 to 10 feet away from the deputy when he was shot and "still closing in closer with the knife in his hand."

He said a family member told detectives that Mejia always carried two knives on him.

The deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave while the sheriff's office Criminal Investigations Bureau investigates the shooting.
