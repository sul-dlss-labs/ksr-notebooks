Mansfield police said a 75-year-old woman was shot multiple times and her 64-year-old husband was found dead in a domestic-related shooting and standoff on Scholl Road.

Police and Mansfield Fire/EMS responded at 3:31 p.m. Monday to a 911 call saying the woman had shown up at a neighbor's house suffering from gunshot wounds.

The victim told police that she fled her home in the 600 block of Scholl Road after being shot several times by her husband, Mansfield police said in a news release Monday night.

The woman was taken to OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital for treatment and was "alert and speaking with investigators at the ER," according to the news release. "Her injuries are not believed to be life-threatening and she remains in the care of medical professionals."

A spokesperson for OhioHealth said Tuesday that they had no information on her.

Mansfield police Chief Keith Porch said officers set up a perimeter around the Scholl Road residence and nearby homes were evacuated for safety.

Porch said in the news release that the Crisis Negotiation Team used a PA system and phone over the course of several hours to try to talk the husband into surrendering peacefully.

"After numerous hours of attempting to get a response we received nothing from inside the home," Porch told reporters at the scene.

A SWAT team entered the house around 6:45 p.m. and "it was at that time the suspect was found deceased," according to the news release.

Bammann said the suspect apparently died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Bob Ball, an investigator with the Richland County Coroner's office, identified the deceased as Robert Neibarger, 64, and said an autopsy has been scheduled.

Porch said police had no information "on what led up to or why the shooting happened."

The case was still under investigation, Porch said.
