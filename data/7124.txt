DECATUR -- Drugs or alcohol appear to be involved in the death of a Rogersville man who crashed his vehicle into the Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce after a high-speed chase.

Quinton Brasco Watkins, 29, tried to elude Decatur police and reached speeds above 100 mph before he lost control and slammed into the building early Tuesday. Officers found marijuana and cocaine in the vehicle, which wiped out all the landscaping on one side of the chamber office before striking a large concrete planter box.

Police received a call at about 1:30 a.m. reporting an erratic driver almost hitting a tractor-trailer on Sixth Avenue near Church Street.

Watkins was declared dead at the scene. His body was sent to the state forensic sciences department for autopsy.
