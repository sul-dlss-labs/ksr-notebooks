A 20-year-old man whose shooting sparked a six-hour standoff at a West End home Tuesday is in critical condition at UAB Hospital, a hospital spokeswoman said this morning.West Precinct officers found Torrence Felton shortly after noon Tuesday, lying on the sidewalk at 519 Frances St. He had been shot in the head.

A female relative told police that her stepfather and mother were inside a nearby house -- 541 Frances St.

Unable to make contact with the married couple, officers surrounded the house for six hours. After firing tear gas into the home, officers entered the house and found Angela "Angie" Felton, 38, and Warren Slater, 41, on a bed dead from gunshot wounds.

Police said it's possible Slater shot his wife first, then his stepson, who managed to escape the house.

Slater then apparently went back inside the one-level pink house and killed himself, police said.
