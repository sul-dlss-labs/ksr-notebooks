Troopers shot and killed an armed man early Friday at his home in the Big Lake area after an hourslong standoff during which he placed his young son in "imminent danger," officials said.

Jean R. Valescot, 35, first called 911 at around 3:30 p.m. Thursday and threatened to shoot anyone who came to the house. A woman was heard in the background yelling for help for herself and a child, troopers said in an online dispatch.

Troopers responded, then called for the Special Emergency Reaction Team. After troopers obtained a warrant, the front door was broken open to establish communications with Valescot.

Troopers didn't immediately provide the address of the standoff.

Negotiations with Valescot continued until after midnight. A woman described as his girlfriend left the house without their preschool-age son late Thursday evening, troopers said.

"Ultimately, after continued negotiations with the suspect, at about (12:20 a.m. Friday) he came to the front door with (his son) and a pistol in one hand and a shotgun in the other. The suspect placed the child in imminent danger and was shot by a SERT member," troopers said.

The suspect died at the scene, despite efforts to save him, troopers said. The woman and child were uninjured.
