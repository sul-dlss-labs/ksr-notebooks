EL PASO COUNTY, Colo. (KRDO) -- The Colorado State Patrol identified the driver accused of stealing a bus from Aurora and causing a fatal crash along Highway 83 Thursday morning.

According to CSP, 20-year-old Daihauonzadre Brooks-Jones was the driver in a 2016 Ford bus who lost control and caused a crash into two other vehicles near Old Stagecoach Road at about 11 a.m.

CSP says Brooks-Jones collided into a Toyota 4Runner and then continued south to hit a Honda Pilot. Then the bus rolled over onto its side on the side of the road.

According to court records obtained by KRDO, Brooks-Jones was out of jail on bond at the time of the crash -- after being arrested in August for motor vehicle theft, driving without a license and DUI, in addition to several other charges.

According to Colorado State Patrol, 42-year-old Kizzy Aguirre was in the 4Runner, and she was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. There were seven people inside the Honda Pilot -- a 66-year-old male passenger was killed in the crash, and four other people, including a 7-year-old girl, were taken to the hospital. Two passengers weren't injured.

The bus was reported stolen at about 9:30 a.m., and Aurora Police spotted it shortly after 10 a.m. A traffic stop wasn't successful, and then the Parker Police Department spotted the bus later on. PPD officers reported that the bus sped away and hit an unattended parked car. Neither department initiated pursuits of the bus.

CSP says alcohol, drugs, and excessive speed are being investigated as factors in the crash. Brooks-Jones was taken into custody, and investigators say multiple charges are pending.
