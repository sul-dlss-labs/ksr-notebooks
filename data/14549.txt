A man killed during a pedestrian crash involving a Springfield officer's cruiser had a blood alcohol level almost four times the legal limit.

Steven Rintamaki, 45, stepped into the path of a Springfield Police Division cruiser on May 25. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The toxicology report has been released and the blood alcohol level of Rintamki was 0.3, said Lt. Brian Aller, commander of the State Highway Patrol Springfield post. The legal limit for driving is 0.08.

OSP was investigating the crash involving the Springfield officer.

The SPD officer was attempting to stop a motorist suspected of driving drunk when Rintamaki attempted to cross in an unmarked section of the road around 10:45 p.m., according to Springfield police. Rintamaki came into contact with the driver's side of the cruiser, and the collision broke the windshield.

The paid leave was part of department policy in incidents like this and not a step taken as part of any disciplinary action, he said.
