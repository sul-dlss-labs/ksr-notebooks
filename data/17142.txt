A 47-year-old Jacksonville man who was shot by an off-duty federal law enforcement officer during an attempted robbery in January died from his injuries Friday, police said.

Talmadge King of the 1400 block of North Liberty Street was shot by Special Agent Donald Wells of the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 17, police said. King had helped move a washing machine into the upstairs of Wells' Springfield home on East Fifth Street earlier in the day.

Wells paid King after the washer was moved in the afternoon but the man returned about 10:30 p.m. and said he lost his phone there. Wells looked but did not find the phone, then returned to the front door where King pulled a knife and attempted to rob Wells, police said.

Wells grabbed his gun and shot King, according to a release from the Sheriff's Office. The suspect was on the victim's porch when police arrived. Officers found a fixed blade knife at the scene.

King was arrested for armed robbery and was absentee booked into the jail while he was treated at a hospital. Staff at the hospital found the victim's bank card in the suspect's clothing, police said.

King was found guilty of fraudulent use of credit cards in November 2014 following a September 2014 arrest. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail. He was also found guilty of petty theft in 1988.
