RIVERSIDE – A Placentia man who was shot with a stun gun by a Riverside sheriff’s officer has died in Hemet Valley Hospital in Riverside, an official said Monday.

Lawrence Rosenthal, 54, was running in and out of traffic Aug. 2 claiming he was on fire, said Jerry Franchville, a spokesman for the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.

Officers said Rosenthal took a boxing stance with clenched fists when officers arrived in the 45200 block of Florida Avenue in Hemet.

“It was kind of abnormal behavior,” Franchville said.

At about 3:50 p.m., an officer then shot him with a Taser, using a 50,000-volt dart meant to subdue him.

Rosenthal was hospitalized for several days in critical condition before dying Thursday at Hemet Valley.

His death is under investigation.

Franchville said he could not speculate about what may have led Rosenthal to act the way he did until an autopsy report is released in the next two months.
