Marcus Quinn Bertonetesei, a 36-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a police officer Saturday, Sept. 24, in in Beverly Hills, according to authorities.

Bertonetesei was pronounced dead at a hospital after he was shot about 10:17 a.m., said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mitch McCann.

The incident began when police received a call of a robbery at the Washington Mutual branch in the 9200 block of Wilshire Boulevard and an officer spotted the suspect walking on Wilshire, McCann said.

The officer ordered the man to stop. The suspect ran east on Wilshire, pushed his way into a car and tried to flee with the driver still inside, police said.

The officer tried unsuccessfully to stop the man by using a Taser stun gun, then shot him, McCann said.
