Tulsa Police identified the officer who shot and killed 18-year-old Naway Willy Friday night, June 2, 2017. He is 37-year-old Officer David Hornok.

Police say it's the first time Hornok has used deadly force.

Sergeant Shane Tuell said police tried to question Willy because he matched the description of the suspect in a deadly shooting at America's Value Inn on 11th Street near Highway 169.

"Something drew Officer Hornock's attention to this individual that he needed to stop and talk to this guy," the sergeant said.

But instead of stopping, officers said Willy ran away, then pulled a gun on officers.

"And it was that guy's actions that completely changed the complexity of the situation," Tuell said.

Willy died at the scene after Hornok shot him.

Officers were responding to a homicide at the motel where 36-year-old Rabson Robert was shot and killed that same night.

"As it turned out, this individual had nothing to do with why officers were in the area," Tuell said.

Tulio Alexander Aviles is in the Tulsa County Jail on a first-degree murder complaint, but police still have questions – like how well Aviles knew Robert.

"I really don't know exactly what it is that drew them together that evening," Tuell said.

Aviles’ wife told police he was "in a panic" hours after the shooting. He also told her he met up with someone who threatened him before. He said he took out his gun "to scare him" and that it "just went off."

Hornok is on paid leave. He's worked for Tulsa Police since 2004.

In a Facebook profile picture, police said Willy is holding a gun that looks similar to the gun he pointed at officers while running from them late Friday night.
