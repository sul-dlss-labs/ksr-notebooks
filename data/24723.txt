Police were investigating the death of a 27-year-old man that occurred early Thursday as officers negotiated with him in northwest Omaha.

The death occurred just after midnight in a home near Terrace Drive and Maplewood Boulevard in the Maple Village neighborhood.

Jesse Twohig shot himself, authorities said. A Douglas County grand jury will be convened to investigate the in-custody death, police said, as required by law.

The incident began about 8:20 p.m. Wednesday, when officers were called to a house on Terrace Drive to investigate reports that Twohig was armed with a gun and threatening to kill himself.

Officers learned that Twohig was distraught over personal matters.

The officers attempted to communicate with Twohig, who had locked himself in a detached garage near the rear of the home.

Officers continued trying to contact Twohig until about 9:30 p.m., when hostage negotiators arrived. The Omaha Police Departmentâ€™s SWAT team also was called to assist with the case.

Negotiators maintained on-and-off telephone contact with Twohig until about midnight.

About eight minutes later, a single gunshot was heard inside the garage, police said. SWAT officers entered the garage, where they found Twohig dead.

No officers at the scene discharged their weapons, police said.

Omaha police and the Nebraska State Patrol are investigating.
