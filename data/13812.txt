MIAMI â€“ A man is dead after shooting a woman and engaging in a standoff with SWAT.

Police responded Saturday to a call from someone that the man was making threats against his family with a firearm.

When police arrived at the apartment, someone reportedly fired at them from the apartment.

Due to the apartment facing Florida's Turnpike, SWAT closed it down in order to prevent the man from firing a passing cars.

The man's son and son's mother were able to escape from the apartment. The son was uninjured and the woman suffered a gunshot wound, but officials are still unsure whether the woman was shot by the gunman or by gunfire exchanged with police.

The man died sometime later, but it is unclear whether he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from a police bullet. He was later identified as 54-year-old Jesus Valdes.

The woman underwent surgery at Kendall Regional Hospital.
