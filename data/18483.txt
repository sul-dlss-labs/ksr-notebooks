The man was pronounced dead at the scene. The man shot by police was identified as Cleotha Mitchell, 37, of the 1300 block of South California Avenue, and the man police say he shot was identied as Jeffery J.

Investigators believe that the man police fatally shot had wounded two men. Navarro said one of those men was pronounced dead and the other was shot in the arm. The surviving man's condition was stabilized at an area hospital.

A weapon was found at the scene, according to a statement from police.

There weren't any officers injured in the shooting.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. Mia Sissac, spokeswoman for IPRA, said investigators responded to the scene of the shooting to sort out what happened. If any video captured the shooting, Sissac said, it will be released to the public within 60 days.

A large crowd of relatives, neighbors and people who had been at a nearby bar gathered early Friday in the 600 block of Central Park Avenue as more than 20 patrol officers stood guard at the edge of where police had taped off as part of the crime scene.

Many in the crowd voiced their dismay at the police, with some yelling profanities at officers.

"That's somebody's cousin that you just murdered," one woman yelled. "I bet if it was some white boy, the family would be getting consoled."

One woman cried out that it was her brother who had been gunned down by police. She declined to comment.

A small group of visibly shaken women at one point was escorted by police into a building near where the shooting took place.

Anthony Johnson, 40, was among those who were standing outside the crime scene. Holding up his phone, Johnson live-streamed the aftermath of the shooting.

Johnson said he was inside the nearby bar and saw the man who was later shot by police talking to women inside the business. He recalled complimenting him on his clothes.

"The man was on nothing," he said, pointing out that bar patrons were searched before going into the business.

After the shooting erupted, Johnson and others left the bar. He recalled seeing blood on the street.
