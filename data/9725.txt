FARMINGTON, N.M. (AP) — State police have identified the suspected bank robber who was shot and killed by Farmington police, and the officers involved in the shooting.

Thirty-eight-year-old Robert Romero Jr. of Bloomfield was fatally shot by officers Wednesday night following a high-speed chase through town.

Police records say that officers Mike Briseno and Jacob Swenk shot at Romero after he fired his own weapon.

Police say Romero went into Citizens Bank at 6:45 p.m. Wednesday, wearing red coveralls and a surgeon’s mask, and asked for money, implying that he had a gun.

He left the bank with an undisclosed amount of money, an police quickly found him and chased him throughout downtown Farmington before he was shot and killed.
