El Monte police shot and killed a robbery suspect following a chase and fight on Monday afternoon, Feb. 15, sheriff’s officials said.

Police were summoned to reports of a robbery in the area of Durfee Avenue and Garvey Avenue at about 2 p.m., Sheriff’s Deputy Abe Bedoyan said. The man was suspected of stealing clothing, according to Sheriff’s Lt. Brandon Dean.

An officer saw someone resembling the suspect at the street corner who then ran onto the 10 Freeway off-ramp at Durfee. The officer caught up to the man and the two got into a fight, Bedoyan said.

A second officer arrived to help, Dean said.

The suspect was shot during the fight.

He didn’t say what led the two officers to shoot the suspect. The man did not have a weapon, Dean said.

Detectives are trying to determine if the man was able to obtain an officer’s weapon, Dean said, adding that investigators still have to go through the body cam videos and conduct more interviews.

The man died at the scene, coroner’s spokeswoman Sarah Ardalani said.

The coroner’s office had not released the man’s name on Tuesday because his family still needed to be notified.
