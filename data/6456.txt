Questions surround fatal shooting in Perry involving police

A central Iowa man died Thursday, but it’s not clear if he was killed from a self-inflicted gun shot or from a shot fired by a police officer. It happened in the Dallas County town of Perry, outside Holcomb Auto Body Shop. Witnesses told investigators they saw 52 year old Mark Holcomb draw a handgun and shoot himself. However, the DCI has confirmed that Perry police officer Pat Jann fired one shot during the incident. Investigators have not said if Jann’s shot hit Holcomb. An autopsy is scheduled for 8:30 AM Friday.
