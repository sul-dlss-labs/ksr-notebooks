? The Wichita city council has approved a $300,000 settlement with the family of a man who died last year in a collision with a police car.

The council approved the settlement Tuesday to end a lawsuit filed by the family of 30-year-old Christopher Perkins. He died on Dec. 13, 2009, after his car collided with a police car responding to a disturbance call at a Wichita nightclub.

The officer involved in the crash, 25-year-old Garrett Shaddix of Wellington, is charged with misdemeanor vehicular homicide, and is scheduled for trial in January.

The payment will have to be approved in court.
