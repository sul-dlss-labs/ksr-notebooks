HOUSTON — Houston police have identified the man who killed a 3-year-old boy and shot his pregnant mother Friday night in southeast Houston.

Houston police said the boyfriend, 29-year-old Ariel Esau Lujan, died after exchanging gunfire with responding officers.

Police said Veronica Valencia was seeking shelter with her ex-boyfriend after an argument with Lujan, her current boyfriend. Lujan tracked her down at the ex's home and broke into it with an assault rifle.

According to police, Lujan shot and killed the little boy and shot Valencia in the hand and leg.

When police arrived, they saw Lujan walking in through the mobile home park while pointing a rifle at a man.
