GRAYSON COUNTY (WSLS 10) - One person is dead following a deputy involved shooting in Grayson County.

The sheriff's office identified the man who was killed as Kenneth Ray Pinter Jr., 45, of Troutville. The deputy was not hurt in the incident.

The shooting happened just before 6 p.m. Wednesday, Sept. 23, when a Grayson County deputy arrived at a home in the 12,000 block of Comers Rock Road while following up on two separate hit-and-run investigations that had occurred earlier in Wythe and Grayson counties.

While attempting to interview Pinter at the residence about the hit-and-run, the deputy approached him to conduct a pat-down for possible weapons.

According to state police, Pinter stepped away, presented a handgun and shot at the deputy. The deputy returned fire, striking Pinter. He was pronounced dead on scene.

Pinter's remains have been transported to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Roanoke for examination and autopsy.

The investigation remains ongoing.

Once completed, Virginia State Police say their findings will be turned over to the Commonwealth's Attorney for final review and adjudication.
