A man found dead in his Trussville home today after an 18-hour standoff with police has been identified as James Robert Wells Jr.

Wells, 44, was found dead about 9 a.m. when officers forced their way into his home at 620 Tiffany Drive after not hearing from the man since about midnight when several hours of negotiations ended. It appears he killed himself, authorities said.

Investigators said they believe Wells' intent was suicide-by-cop but Trussville police fired only bean bags into the house, not live fire.Wells, a nurse at Trinity Hospital, was found on the kitchen floor with a handgun beside him, said Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Lt. Randy Christian. He had rifles leaning up against the wall all over the house, Christian said.



Christian said Wells was reported to be having emotional problems.



Police were called to the home at 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday to check on the man's welfare and, hearing gunshots when they arrived, retreated and called for assistance.



Trussville, Irondale and Mountain Brook police, and negotiators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, remained outside the home through the night and into the morning. Trussville Police Lt. Paul Skaggs said the man had threatened nobody but officers. The last shots were fired about 6:45 p.m.

Family members of the man were at the scene late Wednesday night and aiding police. Negotiators last talked to the man about midnight, Skaggs said. "We felt like if we let him get some rest he would be in a better frame of mind," Skaggs said. "Our goal was to have him come out in handcuffs and go to jail. Unfortunately that didn't happen."

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office will begin an investigation of the incident because of the forced entry and death, Skaggs said. Its officers will replace those of Trussville, Irondale and Mountain Brook who were initially involved in the standoff.
