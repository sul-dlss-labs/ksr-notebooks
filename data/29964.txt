Law enforcement authorities are investigating a murder-suicide that occurred in Carlstadt Saturday and included an hours-long standoff with the suspect.

Following a standoff that shut-down two blocks and included SWAT being called to the scene, a female victim was found dead inside a residence on 6th Street in Carlstadt after police entered the home around 8 p.m., according to the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office.

The suspect was also found dead of a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound.

No other individuals are believed to be involved, police said.

An investigation is being conducted by the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit and the Carlstadt Police Department. No other information is available at this time.

Earlier Saturday, the standoff lasted several hours and forced residents on two blocks to shelter in place as SWAT officers took up positions around the home. In an “urgent announcement” issued at 2:35 p.m., Carlstadt police instructed residents on 6th and 7th streets between Division and Passaic avenues to stay in their homes due to “immediate police activity.”

That warning was lifted five hours later when police said the incident was under control.
