RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA – A man who died in custody after being arrested on a prowling complaint was identified Monday as Jesus Lopez Reyes, 36, of Westminster.

He was arrested about 1:20 a.m. Sunday after deputies said he was found screaming and breaking glass at a home.

Toxicological tests were being conducted to help determine the cause of Reyes’ death, sheriff’s spokesman Jim Amormino said. Deputies used “minimal force” during the arrest, Amormino said.

Santa Ana man guilty in attack, hate-crime case

SANTA ANA – A man faces more than 11 years in prison after a jury convicted him Monday of assaulting a black man with a knife and hurling racial comments.

Abel Castaneda, 39, of Santa Ana was found guilty of assaulting Steve Lawson with a deadly weapon and making criminal threats, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office reported. The charges included hate-crime enhancements.

Castaneda will be sentenced June 23.

He was arrested Aug. 25, 2005, after he pulled a knife on Lawson, who defended himself by grabbing Castaneda’s wrist and disarming him.

Lawson did not provoke the attack, police said.

Charity hoax brings 2 years in prison

SANTA ANA – A Laguna Beach man will spend nearly two years in federal prison for using a charity to bilk two victims out of more than $500,000, the U.S. Attorney’s Office reported.

Donald Westover, 38, who headed the now-defunct Hope For Life Foundation, pleaded guilty in August 2005 to mail fraud and wire fraud.

He solicited money from the victims with the promise of purchasing high-yield investments, the FBI reported. Instead, he used the money to pay personal expenses.
