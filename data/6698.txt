Fighting for Haiti | CBS Reports

In July 2021, Haitian President Jovenel Moise was assassinated, leaving a power vacuum seized upon by rival gangs that now effectively run the capital city of Port-au-Prince. It’s the latest in a long history of hardships, including some in which the US has played a role. Remarkably Haitians are undeterred in their optimism for a better future. CBS Reports explores Haiti’s current crisis, fueled in part by American firepower, and the inspiring stories amidst the anarchy of those fighting to fulfill Haiti’s promise. After the documentary’s release, a spokesperson from Haitian Prime Minister Ariel Henry's office provided the following statement: "We don't deal with gangs. We don't talk to them. We don't negotiate with them. We don't even want to sit with them."
