BURNS HARBOR | The woman who led police on a chase before crashing and suffering fatal injuries Sunday morning in northern Porter County had been acting strangely in the time leading up to her death, police said.

Rose Marie Hurley, 44, of Mokena, Ill., had been the subject of an "attempt to locate" report in Lynwood, Ill., where she reportedly pulled a hotel fire alarm and left behind her medicine, Burns Harbor Police Chief Jerry Price said.

Hurley surfaced at the Pilot truck stop in Burns Harbor about 6 a.m. Sunday, and employees told police she walked in without shoes and with a sheet wrapped around her lower body. According to police, employees said she was babbling and they thought she was impaired.

A Burns Harbor officer walked in to get some food, and employees told him about the woman. The officer tried to talk to the woman, but she ran to her car and took off, police said. A chase ensued from the Pilot location on U.S. 20 to eastbound Interstate 94, then to Ind. 49 and finally back on eastbound I-94.

Hurley was killed a few miles down the interstate when she swerved to try to avoid a set of tire-flattening devices police placed on the road, crashed and was ejected, police said.

Price said the Police Department's thoughts and prayers go out to Hurley's family. He said the officer who initiated the chase is a good officer who is receiving support from the department and community.

"After having reviewed the video from the (police) car camera and speaking to everybody involved, he (the officer) did everything perfectly," Price said.

"He followed the rules of pursuits to a T. There's nothing he could have done or should have done that would have been any better."
