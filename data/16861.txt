HOMINY â€” A man reportedly killed a woman before being fatally shot by a police officer following a vehicle pursuit Thursday in Osage County.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was on the scene four miles west of Hominy where the officer-involved shooting occurred.

The first shooting was reported after 11 a.m. near a residence a mile north of Wolco on Oklahoma 11.

Two men and a woman were outside the residence when one of the men reportedly began acting suicidal, Osage County Sheriff Ty Koch said. The woman was fatally shot when she tried to intercede, he said.

As the other man ran to get help, the man who fired the fatal shot drove off. Authorities began searching for the vehicle after learning of the shooting through 911 calls.

A Skiatook police officer saw the vehicle driving fast and began a pursuit. The man was reportedly driving erratically west of Hominy when the vehicle went into a ditch along Oklahoma 20, Koch said.

Witnesses reported that the man pulled a weapon after exiting the vehicle and was shot by the officer, Koch said. A Skiatook detective said the man was pronounced dead on arrival at Cleveland Area Hospital.

Identifications of the shooting victims and the officer have not been released.
