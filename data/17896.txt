A Selma police officer shot and killed a suspect while responding to a domestic violence call on Thursday night, authorities said.

District Attorney Michael W. Jackson said the suspect, Earnest Fells, 63, shot and seriously injured his girlfriend in their residence before officers arrived.

Officers responded to a domestic violence incident at a residence in the 700 block of King Street at just after 11 p.m., according to the State Bureau of Investigation, who is investigating the shooting at the request of the Selma Police Department.

Selma police Lt. Sam Miller said family members had notified a 911 operator that the suspect had shot their mother.

Officers were relayed that information and heard gunfire coming from the residence upon arrival.

Officers were trying to enter the residence when the suspect fired shots at them, Miller said. Officers returned fire, striking the suspect.

Fells died at the scene, police said.

One officer suffered non-life threatening injuries during the exchange of gunfire.

Jackson said the shooting occurred in front of children at the residence.

The girlfriend was flown by medical helicopter to Baptist Medical Center South in Montgomery for treatment of life-threatening injuries.

SBI's findings will be presented to a Dallas County grand jury, Jackson said.
