Charges will not be filed against two El Paso County Sheriff’s Office deputies who shot and killed a Monument man who was firing an airsoft BB gun at passersby in September.

The deputies, whose full names were not provided, were members of the sheriff’s SWAT unit, according to a news release from the Fourth Judicial District Attorney’s Office. Deputy R. Gonzales and Deputy C. Wheat fired five shots, killing David Jaxon Page, 20.

Law enforcement had been called to Page’s apartment in the 200 block of 2nd Street twice on Sept. 29.

On the first visit at 8:30 a.m., Monument Police Department officers went to the home and found Page had broken windows and thrown things from them. However, an officer spoke to Page, who said he wasn’t homicidal or suicidal, and the officer left in hopes Page would calm down, the news release said.

But officers were back at the apartment at 3 p.m. after 911 callers reported Page was firing an airsoft BB gun at people and vehicles passing in front of his apartment. A child was injured when a pellet broke a car window, the news release said.

Page fired at police and deputies when they responded. He also threw a handsaw at officers. Once the SWAT tactical vehicle arrived, Page came to his door and pointed what appeared to be a semi-automatic pistol at the deputies and officers, according to the news release.

Page was struck by three bullets. The pistol was an inoperable airsoft BB gun with the orange safety cap painted black, which made it resemble a more lethal weapon, the news release said.
