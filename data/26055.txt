The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office identified Friday the man who died in a Thursday evening crash near South 13th Street and West Morgan Avenue.

Pedro L. Colon-Ortiz, 25, of Milwaukee died when a car fleeing a deputy ran a red light and hit his car, the Sheriff's Office said. Paramedics tried to save Colon-Ortiz, but he died at the scene.

A sheriff's deputy noticed a car driving recklessly about 5:10 p.m. on I-94/43 and tried to stop the car, Sheriff Earnell Lucas said. The car exited the interstate at Holt Avenue and drove west as the deputy chased it.

The car crashed into Colon-Ortiz's car headed southbound on South 13th Street, as well as two eastbound vehicles at the stoplight. The 18-year-old male driver and two female passengers got out of the car that was fleeing the deputy and began to run, Lucas said.

Deputies arrested the three people and found a gun and drugs in the car, Lucas said. The department will recommend prosecutors charge the 18-year-old with causing death while operating a motor vehicle. He also could face weapons and drug charges.

The Milwaukee Police Department is conducting a death investigation for the Sheriff's Office, Lucas said.

The deputy involved in the chase has been placed on administrative leave, the Sheriff's Office said. He is 28 and has worked at the department for 10 months.
