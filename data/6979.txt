The man shot and killed overnight in Cleveland by a Cuyahoga County Sheriff's deputy pulled a gun on a police informant and stole $3,000, officials said.

Lawrence White, 22, was supposed to sell $3,000 of Ecstasy to the informant. Cleveland police and deputies were monitoring the drug deal on a radio.

White robbed the informant about 1 a.m. then ran away from a Cleveland detective and a sheriff's deputy who were in a car, Chief Deputy Doug Burkhart said.



White lost his footing in the snow in the 800 block of Whitcomb Road and fired several shots at the Cleveland officer. The sheriff's deputy stopped his car in front of the house and identified himself as a police officer, Burkhart said.

White turned toward the deputy and pointed his gun at him. The deputy fired four shots, hitting White twice. White got up and ran away. He surrendered moments later and told officers where he tossed his gun, Burkhart said.

EMS took White to Huron Road Hospital. He died at 3:30 a.m., Burkhart said.

Officials refused to provide the names of the officers involved in the shooting.

White was on parole from an aggravated robbery conviction in 2004, police said. He has convictions for burglary and aggravated robbery.
