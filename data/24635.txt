GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) — A suspected intoxicated driver and her passenger died in a rollover crash on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation while fleeing Bureau of Indian Affairs officers.

The Montana Highway Patrol tells the Great Falls Tribune officers had received a report Monday afternoon that someone was driving under the influence. The 35-year-old woman driving a pickup truck fled from BIA officers before losing control on U.S. Highway 212 near Lame Deer.

The pickup went off the road and rolled several times. The driver and a 25-year-old man died at the scene. Their names have not been released.

Four other passengers — a 26-year-old woman, two 16-year-old boys and a 6-year-old child — were taken to Billings for treatment. One was taken by Life Flight.

The FBI is investigating the crash.
