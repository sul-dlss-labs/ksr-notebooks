A 31-year-old Illinois State Police trooper has been charged with two counts of first-degree murder after allegedly killing a 29-year-old woman in Westchester shortly after midnight on Sunday morning.

The Chicago Tribune reports that the off-duty officer, Brian Himber, 31, of Chicago, is charged in the shooting death of 29-year-old Tracy Mays at a graduation party on the 10900 block of Nelson Stret. Mays was pronounced dead at around 1:00 a.m. on Sunday morning at Maywood's Loyola University Medical Center.

Police said that Himber, who has been with state police since 2004, attempted to kill himself after shooting Mays, and remains in critical condition at Loyola, the Tribune reports. The weapon used did not appear to be Himber's service weapon.
