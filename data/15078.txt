CHICAGO (STMW) -- A man was killed in a two-vehicle crash in West Englewood early Friday, police said.

About 12:35 a.m., a 23-year-old man was driving a silver van south on Damen Avenue near 69th Street. The man didn't stop at a red light and hit an SUV that was traveling west on 69th Street. The man driving the van hit a pole before stopping, police said.

He was taken to Holy Cross Hospital, where he later died, police said. The Cook County medical examiner's office could not confirm the fatality early Friday.

The driver of the SUV -- a male whose age was not immediately knwon -- was taken to Christ Medical Center, where his condition was stable, police said.

The Police Major Accidents Investigation Unit is investigating the crash.
