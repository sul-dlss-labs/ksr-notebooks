Deputies shot a man in Holiday overnight after he battered his girlfriend and charged at them with a wooden nightstand, according to the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities responded to 3252 Windfield Drive about 10:30 p.m. The man, 41-year-old Aaron Martin, had reportedly beat his girlfriend and would not answer the door when deputies knocked, according to the sheriff's office.

Shortly after midnight, officials entered the home. The woman's ex-husband, mother and son all had reported she had been beaten. Deputies said they could not calm Martin down.

He ran into another room, turned off the lights and refused to let the woman's son leave, according to the sheriff's office. Deputies found the woman in a bedroom and tried to get her out through a bedroom window, but she was unresponsive.

The sheriff's office said authorities used a pepper spray fogger on Martin, and he threw a glass vase at them. Deputies then used a Taser to stun him, but he was unfazed.

That's when, authorities said, Martin picked up the nightstand and ran out the front door toward officers outside. He was shot multiple times.

"We did every possible nonlethal form to ensure this would end safely," Sheriff Chris Nocco told Bay News 9. "Verbal commands he would not listen to. We fogged him; he did not respond to the fog, it had no effect on him. We Tased the individual. Tasing the individual only enraged him."

Both Martin and the woman were taken to the hospital for treatment of their injuries. No deputies were hurt.

Martin was charged with attempted homicide of a law enforcement officer, resisting arrest with violence and domestic battery. Martin has been arrested several times before, according to the sheriff's office, including on charges of domestic violence.
