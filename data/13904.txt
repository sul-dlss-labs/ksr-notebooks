Lt. Northcutt tried to speak to the man, later identified as 21-year-old Joeshawn Edwards Williams of New Orleans. However, Williams immediately ran into traffic, crossing the busy four lane intersection.

According to police, Lt. Northcutt returned to his vehicle to pursue Williams across the intersection. Sgt. Cortez responded to assist Lt. Northcutt. He got out of his vehicle and found Williams behind a vacant building.

Lt. Northcutt was in his vehicle as he was trying to cut off Williams' escape. Sgt. Cortez approached Williams on foot. That's when Williams drew a handgun and began firing at Sgt. Cortez, police said.



Sgt. Cortez drew his weapon and returned fire, striking Williams. Williams was shot multiple times and pronounced dead at the scene, according to police.

Sgt. Cortez suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound. He has been released from a local hospital after being treated for his injury.

According to police, Sgt. Cortez was placed on routine administrative leave pending the outcome of the homicide investigation and review by the District Attorney.
