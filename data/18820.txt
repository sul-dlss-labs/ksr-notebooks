Pueblo authorities have identified the 33-year-old man shot and killed early Sunday by police.

Andrew Byrd died after a confrontation with authorities near the intersection of Small and Acero avenues. Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter said an autopsy has yet to be completed.

Officers encountered Byrd after being called out to the area at about 12:15 a.m. Sunday to find a wanted person.

When police went to check on an occupied vehicle parked on Small Avenue, the driver — Byrd — “backed his vehicle into a police car before driving forward, colliding into a parked vehicle and directing his car at officers,” according to a Pueblo police news release.

Officers fired on the vehicle, striking Byrd, who died, investigators say.

An investigation into the shooting remains ongoing.

A probe of the incident has been handed over to the 10th Judicial District’s critical incident team.
