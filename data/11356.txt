WADSWORTH, Ohio – Police are investigating a fatal motorcycle crash, after the driver fled the scene of a traffic stop.

According to the police report, an officer spotted two motorcycles speeding southbound on High Street.

The motorcycles slowed down and pulled into the Drug Mart Plaza after the officer pulled behind them.

Police say one of the motorcycles did not have a license plate, so the officer initiated a traffic stop. That’s when the motorcycles fled the scene in different directions. The motorcycle without the license plate struck the Wadsworth Police cruiser on his way out of the parking lot.

The officer pursued the motorcycle northbound on High Street. The driver lost control and crashed near the intersection of High and Reimer Road. Wadsworth EMS responded to the scene, where they pronounced the driver, Janko Sudicki, 23, of Wadsworth, dead at the scene.

The second motorcycle was spotted a short time later by a Norton Police Officer. The driver, Ryan Coy, 23, of Mayfield Heights, was arrested after a foot pursuit.

Wadsworth Police Department police Chief Randall Reinke stated, “This was a tragedy that did not need to happen and my condolences go out to the Sudicki family”.

Both incidents are currently under investigation by the Wadsworth Police Department.
