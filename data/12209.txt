Police say they were forced to shoot 35-year-old Vincent Jimenez after he tried to run them over with his car.

The suspect’s 6-year-old son was right next to him, in the passenger seat – something officers didn’t know at the time.

Phoenix police said they were forced to shoot and kill a man who was driving with a 5-year-old boy beside him after he tried to ram their patrol cars Monday night.

Sgt. Trent Crump said officers were unaware of the child in the blue Ford Taurus until after they shot the driver. Officer tried to pull over the suspect after he was seen driving recklessly about 11:30 p.m. Monday, Crump said. They tried to block the Ford at West McDdowell Road and the Black Canyon Freeway when the driver accelerated toward them, initiating a chase. The suspect reached 2900 W. Madison St., believed to be his residence, when he crashed into a brick wall along the driveway, Crump said. http://www.wsmv.com/story/20529287/phoenix-police-kill-man-trying-to-ram-cruisers-child-ok http://www.kpho.com/story/20537937/phoenix-pd-officers-forced-to-shoot-man-who-tried-to-run-them-over http://wjbk.membercenter.worldnow.com/story/20529821/2013/01/08/suspect-killed-during-officer-involved-shooting http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_phoenix_metro/central_phoenix/phoenix-police-shoot-kill-man-after-pursuit
