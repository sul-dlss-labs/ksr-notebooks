Authorities are investigating an officer-involved shooting on the Pine Ridge Reservation.



The Attorney Generalâ€™s Office says an Oglala Sioux Tribal Officer encountered a man in Kyle Tuesday night. At some point in the conversation, the man pulled a gun on the officer. The officer fired at least three rounds from his own gun, shooting and killing the man.



Further investigation revealed the man had two 9mm guns, hundreds of rounds of ammunition, and meth.



The incident is still under investigation. The officer has been placed under administrative leave.
