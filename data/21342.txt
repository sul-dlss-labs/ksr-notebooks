Saginaw Police Chief Gerald Cliff said officers responded to the area of South Washington and Gilmore for a report of a man acting strangely, walking in the street and jumping onto cars, about 4 p.m.

Upon the arrival of police on the scene, Merrill became combative, and officers deployed Tasers, which appeared to have no effect, Cliff said.

After Merrill was Tased, he was handcuffed and placed in the back of a police cruiser, where he showed "symptoms of arrest," Cliff said.

Police officers began administering lifesaving measures until an ambulance arrived to take Merrill to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead a short time later.

Saginaw police have not released the victim's name yet. His identity was confirmed by family members.

Another unrelated death happened about the same time as Merrill's death. Police shot and killed a subject who was reportedly trying to break into a residence. The man pointed a gun at police before they fired and killed him, Cliff said.

Michigan State Police will handle both investigations, which is standard operating procedure in a death involving police officers, Cliff said.
