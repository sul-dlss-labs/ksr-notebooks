Bill Clinton's been busy.

The former president's appearance yesterday with John Hall is one of several he's made with congressional candidates recently and is a sign of the intensity of the House races across the Northeast. Democrats are gunning for upsets in GOP-held districts from eastern Connecticut to western Pennsylvania, hoping to gain a majority in the House of Representatives. And they're calling in lots of artillery â€” national money and big names like Clinton.

This stretch of the Northeast is considered especially tough for Republicans this year for three reasons: ethical scandals; moderate voters who are fed up with President Bush; and weak statewide Republican candidates in New York and Connecticut.

Here are a few of the hottest races:

New York

20th District: Four-term Republican veteran John Sweeney is getting a tough challenge from Democrat Kirstin Gillibrand in this district that runs north along the Hudson.

24th District: Many consider this open seat around Utica to be a tossup between Democrat Michael Arcuri and Republican Raymond Meier.

26th District: Because of his ties to the House page scandal, GOP heavyweight Tom Reynolds is suddenly in a very tight race with Democratic businessman Jack Davis in this district between Rochester and Buffalo.

Pennsylvania

10th District: This hot race, which includes Pike County, has drawn President Bush to campaign on behalf of Republican Don Sherwood, as he tries to fend off Democrat Chris Carney.

Senate

Pennsylvania: Conservative two-term Sen. Rick Santorum is in the fight of his political career against Democrat Bob Casey in one of the most closely watched races for control of the Senate.

New Jersey: Republican Tom Kean Jr., son of the state's popular former governor, is running a tight race against Sen. Robert Menendez, who was appointed to the seat earlier this year.
