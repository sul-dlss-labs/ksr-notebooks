Officer involved in fatal shooting Published 7:48 am Monday, March 11, 2019

COFIELD – A local law enforcement officer is on administrative leave while an investigation runs its course following a fatal shooting on Sunday afternoon near Cofield where lawmen were answering a call regarding an individual described as “combative and irate” and armed with a handgun.

Early Monday afternoon, Hertford County Sheriff Dexter Hayes identified the deceased as 44-year-old Phillip Wayne Outland. Hayes said Outland listed an address in Perquimans County.

Hayes reported that the law enforcement officer involved in the deadly shooting is Hertford County Chief Deputy Will Liverman, a 20-year veteran with the HCSO.

The Sheriff said officers from several local agencies responded to the 1400 block of Highway 45 South shortly after 4 p.m. on Sunday where they encountered Outland. Hayes said that encounter escalated to the point where Liverman had to use his weapon.

Outland was transported to Vidant Roanoke-Chowan Hospital by Hertford County EMS where he was pronounced dead.

“A life was lost today, a family is mourning, and our law enforcement agencies are deeply saddened as a result of what has happened. Please join us as our thoughts and prayers go out to the men and women who were involved in this tragic incident,” Hayes said in a statement sent earlier to the RC News-Herald.

As is mandated with an officer-involved shooting, agents with the North Carolina SBI processed the scene of the incident and are leading the investigation.

Hayes said per departmental policy, Liverman will be on administrative leave, with pay, until that investigation is complete.

Other than Hertford County Sheriff’s deputies, other law enforcement agencies responding to the scene were the Ahoskie Police Department, Vidant Hospital Company Police, North Carolina State Probation and Parole, North Carolina State Highway Patrol and the Murfreesboro Police Department.
