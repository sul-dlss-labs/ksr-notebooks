HEMET (CBSLA.com) â€” Authorities killed a 30-year-old suspect who they claim pulled a gun on them after a short pursuit in East Hemet Wednesday.

Members of a sheriff's gang task force, along with a probation officer, tried to stop the driver of a silver Toyota for a traffic violation at 3:12 p.m. at Acacia Avenue and Yale Street.

Deputies said the suspect, later identified as William McCullough, took off.

"During that pursuit, Hemet police officers assisted," said Albert Martinez of the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

Four minutes later, McCullough stopped and got out of his car in the 40300 block of Mayberry Avenue. He then allegedly took out a weapon and police opened fire.

Neighbors said they saw the situation unfold outside of an apartment complex. Some witnesses said they heard at least 25 shots.

"I saw a car being chased by a bunch of cops," said Andrew Martinez. "They came by my house about three times, they ended at the apartment, there was a shooting, and I witnessed that, too."

Erin Adams, the mother of the suspect's two children, told KCAL9's Tom Wait that she wants answers.

"I have two boys with him...5 months and 18 months old," she cried.

The investigation is ongoing.
