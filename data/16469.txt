There was no reason for that. They could, they could've used Tasers, whatever,” Oliver said.Christopher Huber is a frequent customer of Bader’s Food Mart and finds it hard to understand why Dattilo would put himself in that situation.“It's sad, it really is sad that, you know, young people would take a knife and threaten somebody. I don't know why they would necessarily do that,” Huber said.Conrad said the incident remains under investigation by the department's public integrity unit.Despite the investigation, Conrad said he is standing by his officer's actions.“We absolutely do not want to have to take a person's life. It is a tough thing that officers sometimes have to do, but it is not something that we take lightly,” said Conrad.The coroner said Dattilo had an ID on him from Crestview, Florida.Conrad said his department has not had any run-ins with Dattilo in the past.
