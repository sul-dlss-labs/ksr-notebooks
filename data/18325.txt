A bullet-resistant vest is credited with saving the life of a Paris police officer when a man fired shots at him while he was on a burglary investigation at a home on Brent Street Tuesday night.

Officers say they went to the home at about 9:30 p.m. to speak with 34-year-old Charles Stidham. According to investigators when they entered the home, Stidham fired shots at them, hitting one officer in the abdomen. That police officer is okay.

Investigators got out of the house safely, and say Stidham then barricaded himself in the home. The State Police Special Response Team was called-in, along with K-9’s from Lexington Police. Paris Police, State Police and Bourbon County Sheriff’s deputies were also on the scene.

According to a State Police report, Stidham occasionally shot through the windows at officers as the night continued. That report also says, after an exchange of gunfire, Stidham was pronounced dead by the Bourbon Co. Coroner. As of this report, there is no confirmation on who fired the shot that killed Stidham.

The name of the officer who was shot has not been released.

The incident remains under investigation, and this story will be updated as additional information becomes available.
