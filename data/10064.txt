Frank Johnson, a 59-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, April 13, in the 2400 block of Ocean Park Boulevard in Santa Monica, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers responded to a report of an assault with a deadly weapon shortly after 6.45 p.m., said Lt. Jay Trisler, a spokesman for the Santa Monica Police Department. When they reached the scene, a man flagged down the officers and directed them to an apartment, Trisler said.

The door was locked, so the officers forced their way in through a window. Inside, they found a woman on the ground and Johnson straddling her, stabbing at her face and torso, Trisler said. He said the officers told Johnson to stop, but he continued stabbing the woman.

“Two officers fired a total of four shots,” he said.

Johnson was pronounced dead at the scene. The woman was taken to a hospital with life-threatening injuries.

“It appears to be a domestic dispute,” Trisler said. “The suspect was her ex-boyfriend.”

Police did not immediately release the identity of the victim.
