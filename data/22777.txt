Pinetop-Lakeside police shot and killed a 46-year-old man in a gun battle overnight that left an officer wounded and a police dog injured, officials say.

Police in the east-central Arizona community identified the deceased as Glenn Southwood Jr.

Police say Southwood's mother called the Pinetop-Lakeside Police Department's non-emergency hotline at 10:12 p.m. Sunday to report that her son was intoxicated and had threatened to shoot his wife. The woman said her daughter-in-law might have locked herself in a bathroom.

Officers went to a home in the 1900 block of west Gardner Lane and spoke with a man who appeared to be Southwood. Police said that during a verbal confrontation, the man produced a firearm and started shooting at officers.

Police fired back at Southwood, and he ducked into the house, where he barricaded himself inside, according to a police Facebook post.

One of the police officers had been shot in the leg, right above the knee. A police sergeant tended to his wound, as did other concerned citizens, until he could be taken to a hospital.

At about 3 a.m., after multiple unsuccessful attempts to connect with Southwood, police said a K-9 and SWAT team went into the house to search for him. Almost immediately, the K-9 was attacked by a pit bull, and the dog was shot dead by an officer, police said.

Southwood was dead by the time he was located on a side porch of his residence at 3:26 a.m, officials said.

Police did not say what, if anything, happened to Southwood's wife or whether she was home during the ordeal.

The officer who was shot was said to be in stable condition Monday and was expected to recover. The injured dog was being treated by a veterinarian.
