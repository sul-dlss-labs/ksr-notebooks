WILLMAR, Minn. (AP) — A Willmar man cut his throat and killed himself in a confrontation with police that injured an officer last week, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said Tuesday.

Officers were called to a domestic incident at a Willmar home early Friday. Officer Nicole Wortham found Jose Reyna Lozano, 38, in a bedroom, holding a knife and with a box cutter to his throat. Wortham fired a stun gun at Lozano, who cut his throat. Lozano stabbed the officer in the neck and shoulder, and she shot her firearm, striking Lozano in the leg.

Another Willmar officer, Noah Maschino, also shot Lozano with a stun gun as he continued to threaten himself and the other officer with the knife. Lozano lost consciousness and died at the scene. The Midwest Medical Examiner's Office said Lozano died of suicide due to a sharp force injury to his neck.

Wortham was treated at a hospital and released the next day. Both officers are on standard administrative leave.

A woman in the home suffered a knife injury during the incident. She was treated at a hospital and released.

The BCA is investigating at the request of the Willmar Police Department. Portions of the incident were captured on body camera video.
