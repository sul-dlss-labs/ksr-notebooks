The West Monroe officer under investigation in the shooting death of Raymond Keith Martinez on Dec. 4 also is the subject of a civil suit that claims excessive force was used earlier this year.

The lawsuit was filed against officer Jody LeDoux, officer Justin Hattaway and the city of West Monroe on May 13.

The lawsuit was filed by Donald W. Harger, the owner of Interstate Batteries in West Monroe.

The complaint says a manager at All Tune and Lube claimed Harger stole a battery from the store. LeDoux and Hattaway arrived at Interstate Batteries to collect the battery. One of the officers then told Harger to turn around and shoved him into a battery rack. The officer then pulled out his Taser.

When Harger's wife offered to take the battery back, the officer told her to shut up or they would arrest her. The officer told Harger to get on his knees and said, "I'm going to light you up." Harger alleges the officer pushed him again and then arrested him for theft, interfering with a police officer and simple assault.

The city of West Monroe later dismissed the charges in the arrest.

The complaint fails to state which officer pushed and threatened Harger, but a later court document states that Harger claimed LeDoux is the officer who shoved him and Hattaway was a supervising officer.

The lawsuit is still active in the U.S. District Court in Alexandria and is being heard by Judge James D. Kirk.

West Monroe Chief of Police Jeff Terrell was not available for comment.

As for the shooting earlier this month, Assistant District Attorney Neal Johnson said an investigation is ongoing.

"We're still gathering information right now," he said. "We hope to present it to a grand jury in January."
