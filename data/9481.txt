Off-duty police officer, slain man identified in Friday shooting

Fatal shooting

The Clark County Coroner's Office today identified a man shot and killed by an off-duty Henderson police officer Friday morning after the man entered the home of the officer's female friend. Authorities also identified the off-duty officer.

The man fatally wounded was the woman's estranged husband, identified as Ruslan Zhgenti, 38, of Henderson.

Zhgenti entered the home at 3038 Via Sarafina about 1:15 a.m., city spokeswoman Kathy Blaha said. Zhgenti, who was armed with a handgun, then confronted his estranged wife and the off-duty officer before he was shot, Blaha said.

The off-duty officer, identified Monday as Edward Little, 32, of North Las Vegas, used his own handgun – not his police-issued gun – in the shooting, officials said. Little, who was hired by Henderson police in 2008, was placed on paid administrative leave.

The estranged husband didn't live at the home and didn't have free access to enter, Blaha said. The home's location is near the intersection of Seven Hills Drive and Sunridge Heights Parkway.

Blaha said Monday it's unclear whether the case might go to a coroner's inquest jury. She said if charges are filed against Little it would be after the completion of the investigation, which is still under way.

"It's going to take a little bit for them to work through this one," Blaha said.

NOTE: This story originally said the case wasn't expected to go to a coroner's inquest jury, but was changed to say it's unclear whether it will go to an inquest jury.
