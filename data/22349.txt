The state is lending a hand to those in economic trouble in Southside.

Officials have opened a relief center in South Boston.

The Coordinated Economic Relief Center will provide direct access to assistance from the Governor's Economic Crisis Strike Force.

Governor Warner says the relief center was established in South Boston because of its proximity to the Burlington Industries plant in Halifax County, which is closing in August. The governor created the Economic Crisis Strike Force minutes after his inauguration in January.

The Reverend Jerry Falwell is moving forward with his plan to change a centuries- old state law that prohibits how much land a church can own.

(------------)

[VO-NAT]

[SUPER=03-Lynchburg/2001;]



Falwell is building a new sanctuary for Thomas Road Baptist Church on 60 acres of land in Lynchburg... even though state law limits churches to just 15 acres.

The law goes back 200 years ... and Falwell's lawyers say it's outdated and unconstitutional.

In November, Falwell filed a similar lawsuit.

But at that time, the state did not enforce the land restrictions, so the judge dismissed the case.

Since then, the General Assembly has decided to enforce the law, so Falwell is renewing his fight.

Partnership is on the minds of Carilion Health System officials.

They're looking to join forces with three or four health insurance companies within the next month or so.

Carilion says both Trigon and Southern Health have received draft letters of intent laying out terms for a possible partnership.

MAMSI (Mam-zee) has not.

There is the possibility that insurance companies who have no presence in Southwest Virginia could be chosen as partners, thereby opening up the market to competition.

But some think it's possible your insurance rates could end up relatively higher, if your insurance company is NOT chosen as a partner.
