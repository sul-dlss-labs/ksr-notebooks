A man fatally shot by an Indio police officer Saturday has been identified, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

The officer investigating a report of a stolen golf cart Saturday fatally shot the suspected thief, who was armed, according to Deputy Armando Munoz, a spokesman for the sheriff's department.

The officer was not injured and the Riverside County Sheriff's Department is leading the ongoing investigation, Munoz said.

The theft was reported at about 11:30 am Saturday at a home in the 49-400 block of Tidewater Drive. Indio police responded and one officer attempted to apprehend a man who matched the description given to police, Munoz said.

The suspect was armed, Munoz added, and shots were fired between him and the police officer in the 80-900 block of Avery Way.

The man was identified as Juan Perez, 38, of Coachella, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

The officer's name was not immediately released. Under Indio Police Department policy, the officer was placed on paid administrative leave.

Madison Avenue between Avenue 48 and Avenue 49 will be closed well into Saturday evening as authorities continue to investigate the incident.

Motorists are advised to avoid the area.
