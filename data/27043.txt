A man died Wednesday morning after exchanging gunfire with police officers outside a Henry County home, the GBI said.

William Harris, 51, was fatally shot by Hampton police after telling officers he was going to kill them and opening fire, the GBI said in a news release.

Police were sent to a home on North Avenue for a wellness check, the GBI said. When officers arrived, Harris was at the door and told them he was going to kill them.

Harris then shot at the officers. An officer returned fire, and Harris ran back into the home.

A Henry County police SWAT team was assembled and went into the house, the GBI said. Harris was found dead inside with a gun nearby.

No officers were hurt in the shooting.

Itâ€™s the 78th officer-involved shooting investigation the GBI has opened in 2019.

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also tracks officer-involved shootings that don't involve the GBI, and those numbers sometimes differ from the GBI's tally.
