LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) - The parents of a 29-year-old Carencro man, who died Sunday after being tasered by Lafayette police after an altercation, say the use of the weapon was unnecessary.

Sheila Williams says her son was a good, warm person and wouldn't harmed a fly. Authorities still are trying to sort out what killed Terrill Enard.

Early Sunday, he reportedly jumped from the second floor of a Motel 6 balcony in the nude, was picked up by a car and taken to a Waffle House where he then grabbed an employee before being subdued by police.

Officers used a Taser gun, which they said had no effect on Enard and physically restrained the suspect. He died late Sunday in a local hospital.
