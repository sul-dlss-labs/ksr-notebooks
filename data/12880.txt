DENVER –The Conifer man who perished Sunday morning after police attempted to subdue him with a Taser has now been identified as Guy Guthrie. According to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office, the 55-year-old was a resident of the Pine area.

Jefferson County deputies responded along with medical personnel to 30438 Sunset Trail in Conifer after it was reported that the man was under the influence of drugs, and making suicidal statements.

Guthrie’s brother contacted police to report his sibling was walking around their property carrying a gun. At 6:49 a.m. deputies made contact with Guthrie and determined he was carrying a BB gun. A Taser was deployed after Guthrie refused deputy instructions to drop the weapon. He was then arrested and placed into custody without incident.

While being escorted to the patrol car, Guthrie appeared to have difficulty breathing. On-hand medical personnel promptly began evaluating his condition, which took a bad turn when he stopped breathing. After unsuccessful attempts to administer life saving measures, Guthrie was pronounced dead at 7:57 a.m.

The Critical Incident Response Team was called out to investigate the incident. The cause of death is under investigation by the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office. Results of an autopsy are pending.
