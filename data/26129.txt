The coroner Monday publicly identified a suspect from a shooting who barricaded himself inside a Culver City motel and died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

He was Jeffrey Rivas, 52, of Venice, coronerâ€™s Investigator Jerry McKibben said. The death was being investigated as a suicide, he said.

Rivas was suspected of shooting someone in the neck at 5 a.m. on Flower Court west of Lincoln Boulevard, in the Venice area of Los Angeles, police said. The victim was hospitalized and had stable vital signs, Los Angeles Police Department Officer Mike Lopez said.

An investigation led police to a motel near Washington and Inglewood boulevards in Culver City, where the suspect now identified as Rivas barricaded himself inside a room.

The suspect claimed he had a hostage and a bomb, but those threats turned out to be false, police said. Officers heard one shot from inside the room.

SWAT made entry into the room and discovered the man dead inside, police said.
