A motorist fleeing police drove through three red lights and then slammed into a car at an intersection, killing a father of six, investigators said.

David Inder Bagai, 31, allegedly was driving about 80 mph Sunday and refused to stop for deputies, officials said.

Bagai allegedly broadsided a vehicle driven by Stephen Aguirre, 39, of Camarillo, who was pronounced dead at the scene. Bagai, who suffered a leg injury, was booked on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence and of causing death or injury while evading arrest. He remained hospitalized, with bail set at $100,000.
