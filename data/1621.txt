The death of a man who was subdued by the police when he suffered an epileptic seizure at his job in New Jersey has been classified as a homicide, according to medical authorities.

The finding, first reported yesterday in The Newark Star Ledger, seemed certain to inflame passions over the death of Santiago Villanueva, a musician from the Dominican Republic. The case has already provoked protests from civil rights advocates.

Mr. Villanueva, 35, died on April 16 after he was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed by four police officers who responded to a 911 emergency call from Quick Cut, a garment factory in Bloomfield where Mr. Villanueva worked. At the time, according to fellow workers, he was suffering a severe seizure.

According to Bloomfield police officials, the officers found Mr. Villanueva to be combative, and used force because they feared that he would hurt himself or others.
