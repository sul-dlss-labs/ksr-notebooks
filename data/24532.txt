AMENIA, N.Y. >> A 37-year-old man fatally shot himself following a stand-off with law enforcement, Dutchess County sheriff’s deputies said Saturday.

Deputies said they responded at 10:43 p.m. Friday to a home at 208 Old state Route 22 for a 911 call reporting a domestic dispute involving a man in possession of a firearm. While deputies were responding to the incident, they were informed the man had fired the weapon.

When they arrived, deputies said, they found the man outside the residence armed with a rifle. Deputies said they ordered the man to drop his rifle but he refused to comply with multiple orders given by police.

Deputies along with members of the sheriff’s Emergency Services Unit, Detective Bureau and the state police maintained a perimeter while sheriff’s crisis negotiators attempted to convince the man to drop his rifle and surrender, deputies said. Approximately an hour and a half into negotiations, the man fatally shot himself in the roadway in front of officers, deputies said.

The man was not identified.

No one else was injured as a result of the incident and the investigation is continuing, deputies said.
