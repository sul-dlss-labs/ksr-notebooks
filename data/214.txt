Authorities suspect Alvia Lewis, 37, killed 24-year-old Nicole Ann Dominguez of Denver, who was found near death Saturday in a closet in Lewis' apartment.

Police had gone to Lewis' apartment at 12265 E. Alameda Ave. after receiving a 911 "hang-up" call. When officers arrived and tried to talk to Lewis, he produced a handgun and opened fire on the officers, police spokesman Mark Hellenschmidt said.

The nine officers who traded gunfire with Lewis have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the investigation.

During his attempt to escape from police, Lewis broke into an apartment in a neighboring building and confronted the resident at gunpoint, Hellenschmidt said.

The pursuit returned to the third-floor landing of Lewis' building, where he refused pleas to drop his weapon and fired at officers, Hellenschmidt said. He said the officers returned fire, and Lewis retreated to a nearby laundry room, where he was found dead.

Authorities initially weren't sure if he took his own life or died of injuries suffered in the shootout.

Dominguez, who had been handcuffed, beaten and choked with an electrical cord, died the next day.

Police aren't sure of the nature of the relationship between Lewis and Dominguez.

"We're still trying to nail that down, but we think it's very short-term, very recent," said Hellenschmidt.

Police also don't know who made the 911 call.
