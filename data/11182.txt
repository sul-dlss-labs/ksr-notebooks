A D.C. police officer shot and killed a man Wednesday afternoon in an exchange of gunfire, authorities said. The officer, who was responding to a complaint about drug activity near 51st and H streets SE in the Marshall Heights neighborhood, approached a group of people standing in the area shortly before 2:30 p.m., said Officer Paul Metcalf, a police spokesman.

Robert Contee, commander of the 6th Police District, said that as police tried to speak with a man, he ran and officers chased him a short distance in a neighborhood of townhouses and apartment buildings.

At some point, the man drew a gun and pointed it at an officer, Metcalf said.

Police said shots were exchanged between the man and officers.

The man, whom officials identified as Kevin Bolden, 19, lived nearby in Southeast. He was later pronounced dead.

Metcalf said investigators found the manâ€™s gun on the ground at the scene.

Police did not immediately release the names of any officers who were involved but said the officers have been placed on routine administrative leave while the incident is investigated.
