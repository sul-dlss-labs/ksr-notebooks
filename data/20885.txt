CENTERVILLE (News4Utah)- A trooper with Utah Highway Patrol has been cleared after he shot and killed a suspect on July 4, 2017.

The suspect, 32-year-old Cody Ray McCray, led officers on a high-speed chase on Legacy Parkway in the early morning as the community prepared to celebrate the 4th of July.

“West Bountiful City was getting ready to have their parade. At the tail end of the parade when we had thousands of people lined along Main Street in Centerville, this individual started in the area,” Chief Paul Child of Centerville Police said on the day of the shooting.

Officers were able to prevent McCray from entering nearby cities. Chief Child said he was stopped after he rammed his vehicle into one of their police cars. Child said another police car hit the Mcray’s vehicle and pushed it off the road where it came to a stop.

Soon after the UHP trooper, shot and killed the suspect.

“It is unfortunate that an individual, on a day when thousands of American families were celebrating their freedoms, made choices of his own which placed innocent people in danger, including dozens of responding officers,” the Fraternal Order of Police said in a press release on Friday.

“Officers often are required to make impossibly-difficult split-second decisions in order to prevent harm to the public,” they added. “We are confident the actions of [the trooper] on July 4, 2017 did just that.”
