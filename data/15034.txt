A grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing on the part of an Armstrong County deputy who shot an inmate to death as the inmate allegedly assaulted the sheriff, 47th District Attorney Randall Sims said Tuesday.

Deputy Fleta Barnett shot and killed Mitch Thompson, 52, after Thompson attacked Sheriff J.R. Walker, Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit Lt. Erick Bohannon told the Globe-News.

Bohannon said Barnett and Walker responded to a disturbance call about 9:30 p.m. Aug. 31 at a Cefco convenience store in Claude.

Barnett and Walker arrived at the store, arrested Thompson and transported him to the county jail for booking, police said.

Sims said Thompson had threatened his wife with a knife and held it to her throat.

During the booking, Thompson attacked and overpowered Walker, police said.

Sims said Thompson hit Walker in the face.

The attack lasted for about 40 seconds, Sims said.

Barnett tried to stop the assault, and after she was unable to do so, she shot Thompson, authorities said.

"(Thompson) went from zero to 100 in the blink of an eye," Sims said.

"Before the shooting took place, (Barnett) took every step short of that before she had to do that."

Autopsy results showed Thompson suffered a single gunshot wound to his upper-right shoulder, and the bullet hit his spine.

Thompson and Walker were transported to a hospital where Thompson later died.

Barnett and Walker are back at work.

The sheriff's office could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.

Thompson would have faced charges of domestic assault and aggravated assault.

He and his wife were long-haul truck drivers, and did not live in the area, Sims said.

Sims' office handles felony cases in Potter County and felony and misdemeanor cases in Armstrong County.
