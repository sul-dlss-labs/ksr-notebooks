Instead of being helped by police, who many of us are taught are always there to "Protect and Serve," instead took the life of 44-year-old Michael Angel Ruiz of Phoenix ,Arizona. I must warn you, the video may be disturbing to some.

According to ABC15 Phoenix, a former LAPD detective wants answers as to why his son died shortly after police were sent to an apartment complex to get him down from a roof.

The incident was all caught on video by witnesses. Police were called to try and help Michael Angel Ruiz off the roof of his apartment complex, and according to those witnesses, everything went downhill from there.

The graphic video shows the 44-year-old Michael Anthony Ruiz jumping from the roof after allegedly being hit with a taser by Phoenix police, who then surrounded him. Michael was put in a choke hold and police begin to drag him down the stairs. Michael's head hitting each step as they carried him down the stairs.

According to Michael's father Richard Erickson, "he had some drug issues, but was never violent and respected police."

"I just felt sick to my stomach," he said, referring to the video. "I'd never seen anything like this before, even when I was with the police department."

Michael's dad who has hired an attorney, want's the officers involved fired.

"I don't want to see anyone else's son killed like this," he said.

Many of Michael's neighbors witnessed everything and recorded it all on their phones.

Gary Carthen was good friends with Michael, and witnessed it all.

"This was bad, very bad. Because he didn't deserve that to happen, not like that," he said.

Carthen and his neighbors want answers. Verna Young says you could hear his head banging on the stairs as police dragged him down.

"I started crying 'cause that's not right, to hurt nobody like that," she said. "He didn't deserve that. He was a nice person, very nice."
