An auto theft suspect backed into a police cruiser before an Indio police officer fatally shot him Wednesday, investigators said Thursday morning.

The man's name has not been released and the shooting remains under investigation by the Riverside County Sheriff's Department.

It happened about 1:15 p.m. at the Shadow Palms Apartments complex in the 81-900 block of Shadow Palm Avenue in Indio. Officers were investigating an auto theft when they saw a stolen vehicle enter the parking lot, according to the sheriff's department.

As officers tried to apprehend the suspect, he accelerated his vehicle and backed into the police cruiser. At least one officer opened fire, striking the man.

Officers performed CPR and called an ambulance to the scene. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No officers were hurt in Wednesday's shooting.

The Indio Police Department, as of Wednesday evening, did not comment on the shooting. It also had not released the names of the officer or officers involved.

Shadow Palm Avenue was blocked off late into the evening and traffic was being directed along Monroe Street.

Several neighbors were blocked from entering their homes while the shooting scene was investigated. Some tried unsuccessfully to duck beneath the police tape, but were shooed back by officers securing the scene.

As of 8:30 p.m., officers were still on-scene. The city of Indio brought out large floodlights to provide light for those investigators who were still on scene Wednesday night.
