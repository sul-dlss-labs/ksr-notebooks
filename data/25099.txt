A Richmond County Sheriff's Office deputy who fatally shot a former Boise State University football player in November will not be charged in the case.

According to the sheriff's office, Deputy Stephan Psillos has been cleared by the district attorney's office in the shooting death of Jack Darrel Fields Jr., 25, of El Paso, Texas. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is finalizing the report and has completed all investigative work into the shooting, Special Agent in Charge Pat Morgan said. The report is expected to be sent to the district attorney's office next week, Morgan said. The GBI handled the investigation.

Fields was shot several times by Psillos on Nov. 15 in the lobby of Residence Inn on Marks Church Road. Psillos fired his service weapon after he was stabbed as he tried to handcuff Fields, according to authorities.

Fields died at the scene. Psillos was taken to AU Medical Center with a stab wound to his left shoulder and a laceration to the top of the scalp. He was released from the hospital the next day.

Fields was a running back and special teams player at Boise State from 2012 to 2015, according to The Idaho Statesman newspaper. Fields was involved in a February 2015 incident in which he punched a teammate inside the team's locker room, but no charges were filed, according to The Statesman.

Sheriff Richard Roundtree said after the shooting that he didn't believe Psillos did anything wrong.

Psillos has been with the sheriff's office since July 2017, starting as a jailer. He was assigned to the road patrol in May and served in the Marines for six years before joining the sheriff's office. Psillos has been cleared medically and by the sheriff's office to return to regular duty.
