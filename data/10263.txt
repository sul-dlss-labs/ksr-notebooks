A man is dead after he was shot and killed by Miami-Dade Police officers following a brief car chase, Wednesday afternoon.

Police said 51-year-old Edilberto Santana was a suspect in several robberies and was being followed by undercover officers around 12:30 p.m.

When cops tried to pull him over, the chase began, police said.

Santana eventually drove to the area of Northwest 13th Street and 129th Avenue but ran into a dead end. He attempted to run into a wooded area when "some sort of confrontation" occurred, "leading to the officers to open fire on him," investigators said.

Santana died on the scene.

Officials said he has an extensive criminal history.
