Orlando police on Thursday identified the man as Adam Robertson.

According to police, officers responded to a domestic call around 8:30 p.m. in the 5300 block of Baldwin Park Street. Police said that Robertson’s wife was outside and told officers her husband had a gun and a 10-month-old child was inside the home.

Police said authorities were getting ready to negotiate with Robertson when he came outside and pointed a gun at the officers. One officer, identified by police as Mike Zambito, shot and killed Robertson, officials said.

The 10-month-old was found unharmed in a crib and was immediately reunited with his mother, according to police.

“The loss of a loved one is difficult under any circumstances, and we deeply empathize with Mr. Robertson’s family,” Orlando police said in a news release. “Officers also called in a victims’ advocate, who responded (Wednesday) night, to make sure mom and baby had services and support during this time.”

The shooting is being investigated by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, as is customary.

Police said officers responded to the home in August when a worker hired to install flooring in the home found Robertson asleep in a chair with a gun on his lap while a baby was crying in another room. No charges were filed in the incident, but the Florida Department of Children and Families was contacted, according to OPD.
