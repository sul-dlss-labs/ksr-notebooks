A New York-area commuter railroad says two trains have collided in Connecticut. Police say that 20 or more people were injured, but that there were no fatalities.

The Metro-North Railroad says emergency workers are arriving at the scene of Friday's accident. The rail line referred to it in a news release as a "major derailment."

Fairfield Police Officer Matt Panilaitis says 20 to 25 people were injured. He says there were no fatalities.

The railroad says the accident involved a New York-bound train leaving New Haven. It derailed and hit a westbound train near Fairfield, Conn. Some cars on the second train also derailed.
