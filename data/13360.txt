Franklin Ledel Blevins was allegedly fleeing Fort Payne police officers on Sept. 4, 2013. They were investigating him for a domestic violence incident from earlier in the day.

During the chase, his truck went airborne and crashed into a tree. Ivey was killed in the impact.

The indictment is dated April 2014. It charges Blevins with murder and second-degree kidnapping.

Blevins, now 31, was arrested Wednesday morning. He is now in the DeKalb County Jail with a bond of $50,000.

Blevins was on federal probation at the time of the crash.
