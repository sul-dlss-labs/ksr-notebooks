ROCHELLE, Ill. - The man who died after colliding head-on with a tractor-trailer following a high-speed pursuit on Interstate 40 near Bushland on Wednesday allegedly committed a home-invasion robbery during which a woman's throat was cut, Illinois authorities said.

Rochelle police officers were in the process of obtaining an arrest warrant for Shundale M. Haney, 34, of Silvis, Ill., before being advised he had died after the chase where speeds reached 120 mph, police said.

Texas Department of Public Safety trooper Gabriel Medrano said Wednesday that Haney was a suspect in an attempted murder case.

On Thursday, an arrest was made in the home invasion as a result of follow-up investigations conducted by the Phoenix Police Department and the Rochelle Police Department, police said.

Melissa A. Christianson, 24, of Poplar Grove, Ill., was arrested and charged with home invasion - a Class X felony - in the incident that took place in Rochelle on Dec. 10.

At 6:38 p.m. Dec. 10, the Rochelle Police Department responded to 417 Ave. D in reference to a reported home invasion. Upon arrival, officers were advised a Caucasian female - thought to be Christianson - holding a small child, had knocked on the victim's door, police said.

When the female victim answered the door, a woman asked to use the phone and said her child was sick. The victim allowed the female suspect into the living room and put her dog in another room.

As she returned to the living room, the victim was attacked by an

African-American male, suspected to be Haney, who possessed a knife.

The victim was forced into another room, tied up, gagged and sustained a cut to her throat. The offenders took a small amount of cash and left the residence, authorities said.

Physical evidence of the crime was recovered during the investigation by Rochelle police.

Christianson was transported to the Ogle County Jail on Thursday. Bond was set at $250,000 on Friday.
