PORTAGE, MI -- Kalamazoo-area police officers shot and killed one man and wounded another following a chase Thursday afternoon, said Lt. Dale Hinz of the Michigan State Police.

No officers were injured.

The shooting occurred about 1:10 p.m. in the parking lot of Anna's Vineyard Apartments, located off of Milham Avenue just west of U.S. 131 in Portage.

Hinz said the chase began on the east side of Kalamazoo County. One of the men was wanted on a warrant of resisting/obstructing an officer. A sheriff's deputy initially was involved in the chase, which later included the state police, Kalamazoo Public Safety and Portage Public Safety.

The driver pulled into the apartment complex. After it stopped, one of the men leveled a "semi-automatic assault rifle-type weapon," Hinz said.

A state trooper, a sheriff's deputy and a Kalamazoo Public Safety officer all fired their weapons, Hinz said.

The passenger was killed, and the driver was wounded. He was taken to Bronson Methodist Hospital.

The two men are from the Kalamazoo area, Hinz said. Their identities have not been released.

Kalamazoo's Loy Norrix High School briefly went into lockdown mode during the police chase, spokesman Alex Lee said. Meanwhile, officials at Portage Public Schools were calling parents to tell them that their students were safe, but the shooting could delay the afternoon school-bus run.
