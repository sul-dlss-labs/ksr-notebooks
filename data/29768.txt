A former prosecutor has been asked to examine a fatal officer-involved shooting involving Speedway police initially responding to a report of a "suspicious" person in a parking lot.

The Marion County Prosecutor's Office has tapped former Monroe County Prosecutor Chris Gaal to investigate the shooting "to avoid an appearance of impropriety," court records show.

Speedway Police said officers were responding to a call about a "suspicious person" around 11:30 p.m. Feb. 13 in the 5900 block of West 25th St., just east of North High School Road.

Police allege Deaire Gray ran from the officer and a foot chase ensued, according to a police news release issued at the time.

"During the foot chase, the suspect displayed a weapon. The incident and subsequent foot chase resulted in an officer-involved shooting," the news release stated.

Speedway police did not specify what kind of weapon they allege Gray had, how it was shown, or if any weapon was recovered, citing an open investigation.

One officer shot and struck Gray, who was taken to Eskenazi Hospital. Speedway Police at the time said they didnâ€™t believe his injuries were life-threatening.

Gray, however, died Feb. 21 from "multiple gunshot wounds," according to the Marion County Coroner's Office.

Speedway Police Lt. Jim Thiele said the officer is on leave, per administrative policy, while the investigation is ongoing. The officer's name had not been released as of Wednesday morning.
