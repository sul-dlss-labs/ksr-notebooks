A distraught man who was threatening suicide and armed with a gun was fatally shot by a Columbus police officer during a confrontation Wednesday morning in Franklinton.

Reports of a possibly suicidal man near the 300 block of South Yale Avenue were called into Columbus police just after 10 a.m., said Denise Alex-Bouzounis, a police spokeswoman.

A relative of Billy G. Heeter, 52, of Franklinton stayed on the phone with him while police were en route, encouraging Heeter to put away his gun.

But when officers arrived at the two-story frame house, they found Heeter armed with a gun, Sgt. Chantay Boxill said at a news conference Wednesday afternoon.

There was a confrontation and multiple shots were fired by one police officer at the scene, Alex-Bouzounis said. It was initially believed that more than one officer fired, she said, but that was not the case.

Heeter was taken to OhioHealth Grant Medical Center, where he died just before 11 a.m. No officers were hurt.

A gun was recovered at the scene, Boxill said.

Police said the name of the officer involved will be released Thursday.

A team of Columbus police detectives investigate all officer-involved shootings and Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien's office presents those involving deaths to a county grand jury for a determination on whether charges should be filed.
