LAWTON, Okla_A stand-off between Lawton Police and an armed, suicidal woman ended tragically Thursday afternoon.

LAWTON Okla_ The woman shot to death last week in Lawton was not killed by the officer’s gun, after all.

The medical examiner’s office confirms Lauren Haskins shot herself. The report states she died of gunshot wound to the head, but the M.E. also says the officer did shoot Haskins. That bullet was in the torso and was not the fatal shot.

7News reported Monday that Haskins’ husband said his wife was a former soldier who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.

Police were called to 6404 NW Oak shortly after 3 p.m. when a woman told a dispatcher that she was suicidal and had a gun, Akard said. The first officers arrived and found the woman in the backyard. When they approached the fence, they noticed the outline of what appeared to be a gun in the pocket of her hoodie or sweater and backup officers were requested, he said. Haskins was pacing back and forth and wouldn’t take her hands out of her pocket.

Backup arrived and officers covered the three sides of the backyard fence and tried to talk her down. When she turned, Akard said, an officer saw her pull the gun out and she was shot with two rounds of non-lethal ammunition.

“She was struck at least one time,” he said. “We’re still not sure how many rounds were fired.”
