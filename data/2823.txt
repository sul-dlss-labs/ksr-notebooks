A standoff ended today when the gunman shot himself. It happened off Highway 31 in Flint, which is in Morgan County. The gunman, 26-year old Bobby Joe Holcomb, died at Decatur General Hospital. Decatur Police went to serve Holcomb with a warrant for felony second degree theft. Holcomb was sitting in his car with a 22 rifle pointed at his head. The SWAT Team quickly shut down traffic and evacuated nearby houses.

Decatur Police Lt. John Bradford says, "Bobby placed the gun to his head and backed out of the driveway. He drove around a block or two with Doug in pursuit. He drove back to the residence and parked in the driveway. That's when he looked at Doug and said "back away and leave me alone."

Police say Holcomb had a history of mental problems.
