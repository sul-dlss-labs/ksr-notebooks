An off-duty Chicago police officer shot and killed a 315-pound man who had broken into the officer's Northwest Side home Thursday and had hit the officer with a brick after trying to escape, police said.

The 33-year-old unidentified officer had finished his midnight shift and was asleep in the 1600 block of North Marshfield Avenue when he said he heard a banging at his front door. Since he was tired, he stayed in bed, said police spokesman Pat Camden. The officer continued to ignore the noise when it moved to the side of his house, but he got out of bed when the banging returned to his front door, Camden said.

The officer found Pablo Ortega, 36, of the 1800 block of North Hoyne Avenue, standing in the entryway of his home with a screwdriver. The officer identified himself to Ortega, who said he didn't believe that the homeowner was an officer, but Ortega promptly dropped the screwdriver and ran out of the home, Camden said.

The officer chased Ortega, who was 5 feet 8 inches tall and weighed 315 pounds, into a fenced gangway about four houses south of the officer's home. Because Ortega couldn't scale the fence, Camden said, Ortega grabbed a brick and hit the officer in the head.

As the officer tried to recover from the blow, Ortega moved to strike him again with the brick, but the officer fired several shots before Ortega could hit the officer again, the spokesman said.

Illinois Department of Corrections' Web site said Ortega was convicted of a 1999 home burglary and paroled in August.

The officer, on the force since 1994, was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a bump to the head and was released, Camden said.
