A man barricaded himself inside a Bridgeton business late Tuesday, then was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Bridgeton police got a call for assistance about 11:40 p.m. in the 12200 block of Natural Bridge Road. When officers arrived, the man who had called pointed a handgun at police, who retreated, police said.

Officers later heard a gunshot from inside the building and called the St. Louis County Tactical Unit to assist. As they entered the building, they found the man dead.

No one else was inside the building.

Police did not immediately release any other details about the shooting.
