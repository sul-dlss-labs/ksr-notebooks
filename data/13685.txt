CRESTLINE — Investigators say with help from deputies’ personal recorders, they have determined the man shot and killed by deputies Monday had reportedly threatened to shoot any deputy or firefighter who attempted to enter a burning home, San Bernardino County Sheriff’s officials said Wednesday.

David Andrew Gaston, 56, of Valley of Enchantment, was shot and killed Monday when he reportedly refused deputies commands and allegedly reached for his waistband, according to reports. Homicide investigators did not find a firearm on Gaston.

Authorities were called out to a home in the 22900 block of Redwood Way Monday morning for a fire, officials said. Deputies soon learned Gaston reportedly had weapons and explosives inside the burning home. They also learned Gaston had allegeldy threatened to shoot deputies and fire personnel.

When officials entered the home and found one person inside trying to put out a small fire, but Gaston couldn’t be located, officials said.

Witnesses informed officials Gaston had fled the home through a back door and had run into the forest, according to a press release.

Deputies found Gaston behind the home and began issuing commands to the 56-year-old man. Gaston began walking toward the deputies and refused to comply with the deputies’ orders, officials said, and instead, Gaston reportedly began yelling at the officials.

At one point, Gaston made a movement simulating drawing a firearm and the deputies fired, striking Gaston several times.

The entire incident was captured on the deputies’ belt recorders, officials said.

While investigators were unable to find a firearm on Gaston following the shooting, they did find several weapons inside the home.

Homicide investigators will be presenting their entire case to the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office.
