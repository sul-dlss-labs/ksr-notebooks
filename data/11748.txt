“An officer-involved shooting in the Central Valley has left a 31-year-old man dead.

Authorities say Edwardo De Las Nieves was a convicted auto thief who had recently left a San Joaquin County Jail facility when he was fatally shot near Lodi on Monday.

According to Stockton police, the incident began when De Las Nieves was spotted in a stolen Honda. He allegedly refused to pull over, leading officers on a high-speed chase.

Police say he was eventually spun out by the California Highway Patrol and shot after attempting to reverse the vehicle toward officers. A woman in the car with him was also struck by gunfire, but was in stable condition at a hospital.”
