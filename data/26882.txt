A SWAT standoff Thursday evening near Point Loma ended with officers finding the suspect dead from an apparent suicide, according to police.

Patrol officers were initially sent to the residence on Caminito Pescado a little before 4:50 p.m. for the report of an argument between a 71-year-old man and 62-year-old woman, San Diego police Officer Robert Heims said.

By the time officers arrived, the woman had left the dwelling, but police made contact with the man who was standing on a balcony, Heims said. The man soon walked into the residence, and officers heard a single gunshot.

Because of the gunshot, officers requested SWAT personnel, Heims said.

After several hours without contact from the suspect, police entered the residence and found the man dead, Heims said.

Police radio traffic indicated that SWAT team snipers could see part of the manâ€™s still body on the ground early in the standoff, and that there was a firearm next to him.

Late Thursday night, police had reopened streets that were closed in the area, and the SWAT team had cleared the scene, Heims said. It was not immediately known exactly when the incident ended.

It occurred in an apartment or condo complex northeast of Voltaire Street near where Voltaire crosses above Nimitz Boulevard, in a neighborhood sometimes referred to as Point Loma Heights.
