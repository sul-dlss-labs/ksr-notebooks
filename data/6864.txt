Fresno For the fourth time in less than a month, a Fresno-based police officer shot a suspect.

Police say 41-year-old David Stump forced their hand. They first confronted him at Recreation and Iowa in southeast Fresno where witnesses reported a man attempting to steal a car.

When police arrived they asked Stump to get out of the car but he refused.

At that point Police Chief Jerry Dyer says the suspect turned the car on and attempted to back up into the police officers. They then shot back at him.

Stump was hit 3 times before driving away. A short chase ended two miles away, at Chestnut near Florence, where Stump was arrested.

He was taken to Community Regional Medical Center. His condition is not known at this time.

This is the fourth officer-involved shooting in the Fresno area in less than a month.

On January 26th, Fresno police shot and killed Sylvester Taylor. Officers say they were following Taylor because he was a robbery suspect. When they shot him, police say Taylor was armed and had just robbed a liquor store.

Three days later, a DMV investigator shot Gilbert Jimenez. Police say Jimenez tried to stab a highway patrol officer before the shooting and after the shooting he led officers on a three-mile chase.

And on February 1st police shot and wounded Michael Fang in east central Fresno. Officers say they came under fire as they investigated an earlier drive-by shooting, and shot back to defend themselves.
