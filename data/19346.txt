''It was just a big bang and then shots, oh, man, lots of them, lots and lots of them,'' said Monika Dziedzic, 51, who can see the park from her home on Belmont Street. ''When something happens like this, you think it's a long time, but it probably wasn't. But it was a few minutes at least. And then there was a dead body in the park.''

A state bomb squad was sent to the area, and several blocks were cordoned for hours because dispatchers thought they had heard a sound ''like an explosion'' and because officers said they detected an odor of sulfur, Mr. Berman said. The bomb squad found no explosives, and by nightfall, the area was opened to traffic, said a police dispatcher, Chuck Reinwald.

Mr. Abrams grew up in South River, and his grandfather, Joseph Bodnar, is a former member of the Borough Council. His uncle, Robert Bodnar, is a former police sergeant. Neighbors and childhood friends said he had been involved with drugs lately and did not seem to have a steady job.

At a news conference, Mr. Berman said Mr. Abrams had been in trouble with the law before but did not specify the charges. ''If anything, it's extraordinarily minor,'' he said.

Mr. Berman said that when police received a call at 10:36 a.m. about a gunshot in the neighborhood, Chief Bomba and Lieutenant Bouthillette, who were nearby, responded, which is not unusual in a small department in a borough that takes up only two square miles.
