Authorities say a man armed with a knife was fatally shot by a police officer Tuesday night in Manila, which is about 30 miles east of Jonesboro in Mississippi County.

Arkansas State Police said 41-year-old Timothy Johnson was fatally shot shortly after 8 p.m. by an officer who was investigating a disturbance at 601 Arkansas 18.

"Initial reports indicate Johnson was holding a knife and advanced toward the officer after reportedly being ordered to drop the knife," the agency said in a written statement.

Johnson's body was sent to the state Crime Laboratory to determine the cause and manner of death, the statement added.

The officer was not injured.

Manila Police Department Chief Jackie Hill said earlier Wednesday that officials were initially called to a medical issue at an address on Arkansas 18 and that the person who was shot — later identified as Johnson — at one point brandished a knife in an exchange with the officer.

The officer, whose name hasn't been released, was placed on administrative leave. Hill said he couldn't discuss the case further.

"Everything's turned over to state police," he said.

State police said a report would ultimately be sent to the prosecutor for consideration of charges.
