The traffic officer called for backup, and two squad cars responded. When Mr. Seignious emerged from Sears, the five officers chased him a few blocks to East 187th Street and Webster Avenue, where he drew what appeared to be a handgun, the police said. The officers ordered him to drop the gun, but he did not. Instead, he took another step toward the officers, and they fired, the police said.

The four officers fired a total of 13 shots, at 9:35 a.m. The traffic officer did not fire his weapon. After the shooting, the police discovered that Mr. Seignious's gun was a plastic toy. It was not clear yesterday afternoon how many bullets struck Mr. Seignious, who was pronounced dead at 10:13 a.m. at St. Barnabas Hospital. At the time of the shooting, he was wearing a police badge around his neck, the police said.

Investigators said they believed Mr. Seignious might have been impersonating an officer to intimidate someone at the housing office into accepting his friend's application.

Mr. Seignious, who lived in the Bronx, worked for the city's Correction Department, mostly on Rikers Island, from 1991 until 2000, when he was fired, a law enforcement official said. In 1998, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of stolen property, and paid a $200 fine. The city's Correction Department placed him on probation for a year, but before that time had passed, he was arrested again and accused of the same offense, then fired. .

The badge Mr. Seignious was carrying was a duplicate of an authentic police badge. Its number was traced to a sergeant who is on military leave, a police official said.
