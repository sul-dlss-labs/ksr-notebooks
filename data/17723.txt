A bicyclist fatally shot by Tucson police during a struggle with officers after he pulled out a gun had a felony probation violation warrant, authorities said Tuesday.

Tucson police said Osee Calix, 33, also gave several fake names to officers before the shooting. He also gave false background information.

Detectives later were able to determine Calix's true identity and confirm that he had an extraditable felony probation violation warrant for narcotics-related offenses out of Florida, said Sgt. Kimberly Bay, a police spokeswoman.

Police said Calix on Monday morning was riding his bicycle northbound on the sidewalk of a street in violation of Arizona traffic laws and hit a raised portion of the sidewalk, causing him to fall. Responding officers contacted the Tucson Fire Department to treat Calix's minor injuries.

Police then tried to detain Calix for providing a false name and false information and said he produced a handgun and a struggle with the officers over the gun ensued.

Calix fired at least one shot and attempted to turn the weapon on the officers, police said.

Bay said one officer then shot Calix, who was taken into custody and paramedics were called back to treat him.

Calix was taken to Banner University Medical Center and later died from his injuries, police said.

Detectives from the Violent Crimes Section and Office of Professional Standards responded to the scene to continue the investigation.

Police said Violent Crimes is conducting a criminal investigation into the incident, and the Office of Professional Standards is conducting a separate and parallel administrative investigation into the officer's actions during the incident, standard protocol in all officer-involved shootings.
