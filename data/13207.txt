BUTTE â€” A 25-year-old man who fled a traffic stop in Whitehall died of injuries suffered in a crash while he was being pursued by a Madison County sheriff's deputy.

Jefferson County Sheriff Craig Doolittle said that Bruce Pavey of Whitehall died after his car went off the road southeast of Cardwell and down a 40-foot embankment.

Doolittle says Pavey was pulled over for a stop sign violation in Whitehall just before 7 p.m. Sunday, but drove off as the deputy was talking to him.

The deputy gave pursuit but soon lost sight of Pavey's car. A Madison County deputy later saw Pavey's car speeding through Cardwell and started to pursue him. Pavey lost control of his car and was ejected. He died at the hospital in Butte.
