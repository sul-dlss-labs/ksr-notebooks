HUNTSVILLE, AL - A wrongful death lawsuit has been filed against several local governments and members of the Madison-Morgan County counterdrug squad over a high-speed police chase that resulted in the death of a NASA engineer.

Attorneys for Kelly Spurlock, whose husband, Darren Spurlock, was killed last May in a crash with a suspected drug buyer fleeing police, filed the lawsuit Thursday in Madison County Circuit Court.

Three members of the counterdrug STAC team, and the governments of Huntsville, Decatur and Madison, and Morgan and Madison counties, which cooperate on the team, are named as defendants. STAC team members Jim Williams, Tony McElyea and Terry Lucas are also named in the complaint.

Kelly Spurlock, who has two young sons, had filed a notice with the City of Huntsville in October seeking $5 million as part of the wrongful death claim. The suit filed Thursday asks for a jury to set damages.

Huntsville Police Chief Henry Reyes' office referred a call for comment to the city attorney's office, which did not immediately respond this morning.

The suit says the governments and STAC supervisors failed to adequately supervise and train their officers on the dangers of high-speed chases. The officers are named for initiating the chase at midday through Huntsville and failing to break it off once it became clear other motorists were at risk.

A Huntsville Police Department investigation determined the chase, at least 70 mph, was "conducted within policy."

Valorie Kiel Cox, 36, who crashed into Spurlock while fleeing police, pleaded guilty in federal court in April to a second-degree murder charge and received a 30-year sentence.
