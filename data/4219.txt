Driver in fiery crash was a federal fugitive

The driver of a car that was being pursued by police when it crashed and burned in Mililani early yesterday morning was wanted by federal authorities for violating terms of his supervised release.

Onaka Corey Y. Onaka, 29, was killed when he lost control of his 2005 Mazda RX8 and it slammed into a tree on Meheula Parkway shortly after midnight. The car burst into flames, and police were unable to save Onaka.

Onaka was the driver of one of two cars that caught the attention of two police officers when the cars made illegal U-turns on Farrington Highway near Waipahu High School. One car, described as possibly a dark-colored Acura Integra, made another U-turn while the Mazda sped off, said acting Assistant Chief Doug Miller.

Two police officers pursued the Mazda as it got onto the northbound lanes of the H-2 Freeway at high speed, Miller said. The driver took the Mililani Mauka exit, made another illegal turn on Meheula and headed south on the roadway, he said.

Miller said the car "briefly spun out" and then sped off again before it turned onto the median and hit a tree. He said the pursuit lasted about four minutes.

"This was evidence of someone who did not want to be stopped," Miller said.

He said the Mazda had paper dealer tags and that there was no way for the officers to know who owned the car or whether it was stolen. Miller said the case remains under investigation.

Police yesterday did not release Onaka's name, but federal authorities confirmed that Onaka was the driver of the car.

Onaka had been charged with distribution of methamphetamine, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest March 4 for violating terms of his supervised release. The U.S. Marshals Service had warned on its Web site that Onaka should be considered armed and dangerous.
