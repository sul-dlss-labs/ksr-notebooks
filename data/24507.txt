OPELOUSAS — A grand jury handed up indictments Monday against two Opelousas teenagers accused in the fatal crash that killed 11-year-old Bryla Bell.

Jon’Torras Bryant, 17, and Kelvin Joel Ruiz Monte, 19, are indicted on one count each of aggravated kidnapping and negligent homicide.

If convicted of aggravated kidnapping, the teens face a mandatory life sentence without the benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.

Negligent homicide carries a prison sentence, with or without hard labor, of up to five years.

Bell died in May when she drove a vehicle into a tree. Deputies at the time said Bryant and Monte picked up Bell in the vehicle, but they fled the vehicle once her mother began to follow them in another vehicle.

Bell then led law enforcement on a fatal high-speed chase, according to police. Read more on the story here.
