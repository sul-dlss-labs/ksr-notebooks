IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) --- The university of Iowa graduate student killed Sunday after opening fire on police was granted a handgun permit only after his psychologist assured the county sheriff it wouldn't pose a safety threat.

Johnson County Sheriff Lonny Pulkrabek says Tuesday he required Taleb Salameh to get the letter from his doctor because information about his background provided by the university concerned the sheriff. A university official had asked Pulkrabek to delay action on Salameh's permit application filed in February 2010, saying Salameh was involved in an assault on another student and had been convicted of numerous alcohol-related crimes.
