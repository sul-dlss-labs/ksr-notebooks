MECOSTA COUNTY -- A badly decomposed body found Sunday has been identified as a 28-year-old man who jumped into the Muskegon River while fleeing police two years ago.

Fredrick Andrew Hodges was identified thought dental records. He was last seen alive Nov. 27, 2005, when he allegedly failed to pay for gas in the city. He fled and police gave chase until he reached the North Bridge in Big Rapids, where he jumped into the Muskegon River.

"One of our officers went in the water to stop him. That officer had to return to shore because of the conditions, and the victim/suspect was last seen going down the river," said Jim Cook, assistant director of Ferris State University Campus Safety.

Hodges' death is believed to be the result of accidental drowning, said Detective Drew Nielson of the Mecosta County Sheriff's Department.
