A 19-year-old Fontana man was shot and killed by Ontario police early Sunday after smashing into several cars while trying to elude officers breaking up an illegal drag race.

The man was identified as Jose Castanon, according to Associated Press. The incident occurred shortly after 2 a.m., when police arrived to break up a gathering of some 200 cars in an area known for illegal street racing, said police Sgt. Gary Dufour.

He said a silver 1998 Mitsubishi Eclipse took off in a pursuit lasting about five minutes, ramming two police cars and a Honda Civic. As the Eclipse tried to force the Honda out of its path, Dufour said, an officer, fearing for the safety of its occupants, approached the Eclipse and shot its driver once in the upper right side.

There were no other injuries and the incident was under investigation, Dufour said.
