HYDE PARK, Calif. The pursuit started around 11:30 p.m. Friday when officers noticed a vehicle being driven recklessly on Florence Avenue in Hyde Park.

The chase ended three minutes later at the Crenshaw Boulevard intersection when the vehicle crashed into a white car.

Two people in the vehicle that was hit by the pursuit vehicle were fatally injured, said police. Authorities said the victims, married couple Demetria Dorsey, 50, and Kelvin Dorsey, 54, were driving home from a dinner party when the suspect collided with them.

Kelvin, an airport security officer at LAX, died at the scene. Demetria, a U.S. Postal Service employee died after being rushed to a hospital.

The victims had been married for 18 years and leave behind a 15-year-old daughter and four daughters from previous relationships.

"We share his life, we share his memories," said Kelvin's niece Angelique Rawls, who gathered with other family members at the site of the accident Saturday. "He was a jovial man, a man that could walk into the room and if the room was dark or people were sad - even situations like this - he would just share a smile."

South Traffic investigators were overseeing the crash scene. The intersection of Crenshaw and Florence was closed well into the early morning hours of New Year's Day.

The alleged drunk driver, 27-year-old Jorge Molina, suffered minor injuries and was booked under two counts of murder.
