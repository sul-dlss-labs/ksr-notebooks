MISSAUKEE COUNTY, MI -- A suspect in a northern Michigan homicide shot himself early Sunday morning after he fled from law enforcement officials, police said.

Troopers from the Michigan State Police Houghton Lake Post were performing a welfare check at 8 p.m. Saturday, April 3, when they found a 62-year-old woman deceased from an apparent homicide inside her home on North Seven Mile Road in Missaukee County’s West Branch Township.

No one else was in the home when the victim was found, but troopers quickly developed a suspect -- a 30-year-old man and relative of the victim -- and put out a broadcast alert, according to a Michigan State Police news release.

The Cadillac Police Department located the suspect vehicle and attempted a traffic stop shortly after 1 a.m. Sunday, April 4.

The suspect fled and officers pursued him, per the release. The suspect fired shots at police, missing the vehicles and officers.

Missaukee County Sheriff’s deputies assisted in the pursuit and deployed stop sticks on M-55 near M-66, which disabled the vehicle, police said.

The suspect fled on foot. MSP Aviation located the suspect’s body shortly after 6 a.m. Sunday near a golf course.

MSP Emergency Support Team members determined he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

The MSP Emergency Support Team, MSP Canine Team and MSP Aviation Team also assisted in the pursuit.

An investigation continues into the incident and notifications are being made to the victim’s family members.
