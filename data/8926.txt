A Savannah-Chatham police officer fatally shot a man who authorities say had stabbed the patrolman with a knife during a foot chase Monday morning in the Carver Heights neighborhood.

The officer, whose vital organs were shielded by a protective vest, was taken to an area hospital with wounds described as not life-threatening; the suspect, identified as Larry Edward Wall Jr., 30, died at the scene, in the 1000 block of Carver Street, said Gena Moore, metro police spokeswoman.

The officer's name was not released. He has been on the force less than 10 years and is assigned to patrol the West Chatham Precinct, Moore said, not elaborating. Late Monday, Moore said the officer had been released from medical care. Both the officer and Wall are African-American.

Per police policy, the officer was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation that was taken over Monday afternoon by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

The incident marked metro police's first officer-involved shooting since 2007, when the department reported eight such incidents.
