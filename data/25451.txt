WEST MEMPHIS, AR (WMC) - Six West Memphis police officers who shot and killed two people earlier this year are not being charged.

In a Friday morning news conference, West Memphis Police Department leadership answered questions about the encounter and released dramatic dash cam video of the incident.

Officers shot and killed 22-year-old Megan Rivera and 30-year-old De’Angelo Brown, both of Lancaster, South Carolina, during an attempted traffic stop Jan. 16.

Assistant Chief Robert Langston said officers attempted to pull the car over because it had no license plate and had high beams. When the car didn’t stop a chase ensued.

Langston said the car, with Rivera behind the wheel, rammed police cruisers multiple times and ultimately ran over an officer’s legs. That’s when six WMPD officers opened fire, killing Brown and Rivera.

Police released dash camera video Friday, which shows the chase and the violent ending as the officer is hit and his fellow officers open fire.

The four videos show varying angles of the encounter. In one video, Brown can be seen raising his hands in the passenger seat before Rivera reverses the car and hits the officer.

Police later found the suspects’ car was carjacked from a 72-year-old woman in South Carolina. Officers discovered a .22 rifle and crack cocaine inside the vehicle.

Brown and Rivera were also wanted on shoplifting charges.

The officer who Rivera hit suffered major injuries to both legs. He is not being identified.

Five other officers were relieved of duty with pay while Arkansas State Police investigated the shooting.

ASP reviewed the dash camera footage as part of their investigation, and grand jury decided the officers should not face charges.

An internal investigation is still in place, but Langston said it should wrap up within a few days.
