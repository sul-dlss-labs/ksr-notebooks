A man was fatally shot today during a confrontation with two Tucson police officers answering an emergency call about an armed robbery, police say.

UPDATE: Man dies after being shot by Tucson police officer answering armed robbery call

Two officers arrived at a check-cashing business near East Fort Lowell Road and North First Avenue Tuesday morning after a report that it was being robbed, Sgt. Pete Dugan, a police spokesman says.

Soon after the officer arrived, a man armed with a gun walked out of the business.

The man ignored commands to drop the weapon and at some point in the confrontation one of the officers shot him. He died later at a hospital, Dugan said.

In the robbery, a gunman forced a woman working at the check-cashing business into a back room and was able to obtain an unknown amount of money before walking out and being confronted by officers, Dugan said today.

The employee was not injured.

Dugan said he did not know the identity of the man shot nor did he know how many times he was struck by gunfire.

No officers were injured.

Detectives are in the early stages of investigating the robbery and the circumstances of the shooting, Dugan said.

Eastbound lanes of Fort Lowell Road remained closed just after noon.
