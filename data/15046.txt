GADSDEN, Alabama -- A man suspected of carrying out a home robbery earlier today shot himself after a stand-off of several hours in Oxford, Calhoun County Sheriff Larry Amerson said.

Officials spent part of the day searching for Michael Bresley, 40, who was followed into a wooded area off U.S. 78 about mid-morning. The stand-off resulted in nearby Coldwater Elementary being put on lockdown for several hours.

Amerson said Bresley shot himself and was taken to Regional Medical Center shortly after 2 p.m. Coroner Pat Brown confirmed Bresley died, and his death is under investigation.

Amerson said Bresley, along with a woman, was discovered by a homeowner who returned to her Alexandria residence to find him with a gun taken from her home. Bresley pointed the gun at the homeowner and took her phone before fleeing the scene. Authorities were given a description of Bresley's getaway vehicle, which was spotted by a deputy near the Winn-Dixie off U.S. 78 in Oxford.

Bresley drove behind the grocery store and left the vehicle, fleeing into a heavily wooded area. The woman with him was caught at the scene, Amerson said.

Deputies then set up a perimeter around Taylor's Chapel Road and began looking for Bresley. They also employed a heavily armoedr vehicle, which began pushing through the brush to assist in the search, Amerson said. This drove Bresley into the open, where he was spotted by deputies.

Bresley then put his gun to his head and began threatening to kill himself, he said, before firing a shot.

"He kept saying things like, 'I'm going to die today,' and 'I'm not going back to prison,'" Amerson said. "This continued for awhile, and we weren't making any progress. We did everything we could to try and get him to surrender peacefully."

The woman, whose name has not been released, will probably be charged with burglary, Amerson said.
