The Alabama Bureau of Investigation continues to look into a fatal officer-involved shooting in Ozark. Police Chief Tony Spivey said an officer opened fire on a suspect who was wielding a machete. Spivey identified the person shot as Joseph Dewey Overstreet, 42, of Ozark.

Spivey said Ozark police received a domestic violence call at 4:57 PM Friday afternoon, on Brandi Lane, which is off Logan Road in Ozark. Police arrived at the residence to find Overstreet in the middle of the street carrying a machete.

Before the call, witnesses reported Overstreet was making threats against family members, had damaged property and had poured gasonline inside of a shed on the property. He'd also made threats to burn down the residence.

Spivey said Overstreet began "aggressive movement" toward the officer, and was told to stop and drop his weapon numerous times. When the man got too close, the officer fired twice, striking Overstreet twice in the chest.

The officer immediately started life-saving measures while awaiting medics, but Overstreet was pronounced dead after being transferred to Dale Medical Center.

The officer, who has not been unidentified, was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Chief Spivey said after a review of the officer's in-car camera, as well as statements from witnesses, he believes the officer followed proper departmental procedures.
