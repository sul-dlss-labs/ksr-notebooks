HENDERSON, Ky. - The Henderson County Coroner's Office has identified a man who shot himself to death in his vehicle early Wednesday after a "low-speed" pursuit with local police.

Officials said the person is Owensboro resident Bradley Scott White, age 30.

The body has been transported to the medical examiner's office in Madisonville for an autopsy.

Henderson officers said the chase started around 2 a.m. Wednesday when authorities initiated a vehicle stop at the intersection of 10th and North Adams streets in the city of Henderson due to traffic violations.

"Upon stopping the vehicle, the driver held a hand gun up in view and then to his head while making threatening movements," a news release said.

"A low-speed vehicle pursuit then took place from that location, ultimately ending at the point where Kentucky 416 meets the Green River in Hebbardsville.

"Once the pursuit ended at the river, the driver ended his life with the hand gun," HPD officials said.

According to the website kentucky.arrests.org, White has an extensive arrest history -- including a run-in with police in Henderson on March 27 of this year when he was charged with operating a motor vehicle on a suspended license and not having proper registration.

Other past charges include trafficking in meth (multiple), unlawful transaction with a minor, tampering with evidence, and more.
