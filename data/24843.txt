CULVER CITY (CBSLA) â€” A woman was killed early Thursday in a fiery crash at the end of a police pursuit out of Culver City.

A chase that started with Culver City police trying to pull a van over on Slauson Avenue ended with a crash into a wall at about 1 a.m. on the Venice Boulevard offramp from the 405 Freeway. Two men and two women, all in their 20s, inside the van had to be extricated with the Jaws of Life.

Samantha Gomez, 19, who had been seating in the back seat, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office.

The driver, 26-year-old Luis Andrade of Hawthorne, also suffered major injuries but was arrested and will likely be booked on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.

According to the California patrol, the 2016 Honda Odyssey van that Andrade had been driving was reported stolen.
