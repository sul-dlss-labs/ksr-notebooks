The Regional Major Crimes Team has completed its investigation of the fatal Camas officer-involved shooting and forwarded the case to the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office for review.

The prosecutor’s office will determine whether or not the March 12 shooting was justified.

Edwin L. Glessner, 32, who was killed during the incident, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Vancouver Police Department. The department said that the Clark County Medical Examiner’s Office determined the manner of death.

Camas police Officer Steven Forgette, 28, fired his weapon during the incident. He was hired by the department in November 2015 and is assigned to the patrol division. He is also a member of the Southwest Washington Regional SWAT Team.

At about 9:15 p.m., officers with the Camas and Washougal police departments responded to a disturbance call involving a weapon in the area of Northeast Second Avenue and Joy Street. They made verbal contact with Glessner, who was not compliant and had a handgun, police said.
