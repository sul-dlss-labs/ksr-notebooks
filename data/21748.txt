NEWARK, Aug. 8 - A man who was shot and killed by a Newark police officer on Sunday night had opened fire first on the officer and his partner, the police said on Monday.

The shooting took place outside the Seth Boyden housing complex in the city's South Ward. The police said the two officers, responding to reports of gunfire, encountered Ibn Berger, 20, wandering in the street with a 9-millimeter handgun about 7:30 p.m.

When Mr. Berger fired at them, the police said, the officers ducked for cover and returned fire. Mr. Berger was hit once in the head.

The police said Mr. Berger shot two people, Corey Borden, 22, with whom he had been smoking marijuana soaked in formaldehyde, and Keisha Young, 26, a friend of Mr. Borden's, shortly before the officers arrived.
