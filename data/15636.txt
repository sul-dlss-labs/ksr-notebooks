MUSKOGEE — A former Bacone College linebacker was fatally shot by a Muskogee police officer who responded to a domestic disturbance Saturday afternoon, officials confirmed.

Police received a call around 4 p.m. Saturday about an apparent domestic disturbance involving a man and woman around the Old Agency Baptist Church, around the 1800 block of North 24th Street, Cpl. Mike Mahan said. The woman entered the church to attend a wedding but the man, identified as Terence Walker, was outside with a gun and asked the woman to exit the building, he said.

Walker reportedly began running from the officer who responded to the scene, Mahan said in a release Saturday night. While running, an item fell from him and he reached to pick it up, then turned toward the officer, the release states.

A witness told police Walker tried to hand them the weapon but they refused to carry it, Mahan said. The officer, who said he saw the weapon, fired multiple times, killing Walker.

“A loaded semi-automatic pistol was recovered in close proximity to the suspect,” Mahan said.

Walker, 21, is originally from Texas, according to the release. A 2012 roster of the Bacone College football team, which was Walker’s freshman year, states he went to high school in Austin.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting. Mahan did not identify the officer who killed Walker but said he is on paid leave while authorities investigate the incident.
