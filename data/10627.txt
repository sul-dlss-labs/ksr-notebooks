Antonio Tafolla, a 35-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Glendale police Friday, Sept. 30, near Glendale Avenue and San Fernando Road in Glendale, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The incident began at 2:30 a.m. with a call of shots fired near the intersection of Brand Boulevard and San Fernando Road.

Two officers arrived and heard another gunshot a block away at Brand and Glendale, said Sgt. Tom Lorenz, a spokesman for the Glendale Police Department.

Once there, they spotted a man, later identified as Tafolla, armed with a pistol. He fired at the officers, who returned fire, Lorenz said.

“There’s no other way to describe it: A gun battle took place for a period of time,” Lorenz said.

Tafolla was eventually shot and died at the scene, authorities said.

A third officer arrived on scene, and his car was hit once by a bullet.

The officer-involved shooting investigative team for the L.A. County district attorney’s office was called to the scene, as was the L.A. County coroner’s office.

“Now we’re going to try to determine what was going on with this guy and why he was walking around firing his weapon,” Lorenz said.

Anyone with additional information about the fatal shooting is asked to contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
