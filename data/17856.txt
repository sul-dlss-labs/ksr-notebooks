FORT PIERCE â€” A motorist fatally shot himself early Wednesday after being pursued by law enforcement from Port St. Lucie, according to St. Lucie County sheriff's officials.

That was after he had been drinking and took a lot of pills, according to police.

At one point, the motorist drove off the side of Florida's Turnpike, went through a fence and got on Southwest Macedo Boulevard, said police spokesman Sgt. Frank Sabol.

The incident started about 11:30 p.m. Tuesday when the man's roommate called police from a residence in the 400 block of Southeast Nome Drive, Port St. Lucie, and reported the driver's condition.

Police initially saw him on Port St. Lucie's Southbend Boulevard and followed him until he drove off the turnpike. Police stopped their pursuit there. Sheriff's deputies next saw him on Selvitz Road near Fort Pierce. The vehicle was pursued for three-fourths of a mile, from the intersection of Selvitz and Edwards roads to the intersection of Jenkins and Altman roads. There the motorist crashed into a tree.

The sheriff's SWAT team and Crisis Negotiation Team unsuccessfully made attempts to contact the driver. When the SWAT team went into the vehicle, the driver was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The name of the motorist hasn't been released pending notification of relatives.
