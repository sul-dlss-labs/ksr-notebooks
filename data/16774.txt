HPD Officer Involved Shooting Report Students from Northwestern University’s, Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, Mathematical Methods in the Social Sciences Program, in Evanston, Illinois completed an analysis of officer involved shootings involving Houston police officers in June of 2014. The primary goal of the study was to mine data and identify significant pre-scene and on-scene factors that substantially affected the likelihood of Officer-Involved Shooting incidents. The secondary goal of this study was to identify factors that meaningfully impacted the significant on-scene factors, in particular ones related to officer’s behavior prior to gun use, that were highly correlated with likelihood of an Officer-Involved Shooting. The study’s third goal was to focus on investigating specific relationships among selected pre-scene and on-scene factors, as well as between these factors and likelihood of Officer-Involved Shooting incidents. The findings of this effort are included within the report.
