TRONA >> The Sheriff’s Department is investigating how and why a man died Friday soon after being placed in custody inside a patrol car, according to a San Bernardino County sheriff’s news release.

A deputy was dispatched 3:19 p.m. Friday to the 84000 block of 12th Street in Trona after a report of an unwanted subject, the news release states. The deputy found a man matching the description, Jonathan Barrio, 35, of Trona, who appeared to be under the influence of an unspecified substance.

Barrio “became combative” when the deputy tried to arrest and handcuff him, but eventually was placed in the back seat of the patrol car and hobbled, the news release states.

Sometime after being hobbled “Barrio experienced a medical emergency and stopped breathing,” the news release states. An unspecified person or persons began administering medical aid and Barrio was brought by ambulance to a Ridgecrest hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Kern County Coroner officials will determine the cause of death, the news release states.
