A Barnegat Township man shot himself in the head as police arrived as his house to take him into custody, the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office said, and was still alive the next day.

Officers from the township Police Department went to a home on the 100 block of Redwood Drive at 7:30 p.m. Monday, according to a statement from police.

Carmine Maggio, 51, was informed by the officers of an Arizona arrest warrant for a parole violation, but refused to surrender to police and ran from the doorway.

The Ocean County Sheriff’s Department Warrants Division was called in, and after entering the home, the warrant team found Maggio inside a bathroom.

“As he was about to be taken into custody, Mr. Maggio shot himself in the head with a small caliber handgun,” the statement said. Maggio was airlifted to the AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center, Mainland Division, in Galloway Township where he was being treated Tuesday morning.

Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Bill Hetrick of the Barnegat Township Police Department at 609-698-5000 or Detective Brian Haggerty of the Ocean County Prosecutor’s Office at 732-929-2027. The New Jersey State Police is also assisting in this investigation.
