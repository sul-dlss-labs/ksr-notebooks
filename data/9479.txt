MADISON COUNTY â€¢ A six-hour police standoff ended early Thursday when tactical officers forced their way into a home just outside Collinsville and found a man dead.

Capt. Brad Wells of the Madison County sheriff's office said that Mark Dodson, 48, had shot himself.

Police surrounded Dodson's home at 101 St. Mary Drive after he reportedly shot his live-in girlfriend about 10 p.m. Wednesday. The wounded woman ran to a neighbor's home, in the 2500 block of Vandalia Street, for help.

Police tried several times through the night to talk to Dodson but got no response.

Officers who stormed the dwelling about 4:20 a.m. found him dead in a bedroom. They believe he had shot himself with the same weapon he used to shoot his girlfriend.

The woman appeared to have been shot in the shoulder with a shotgun and was expected to recover, officials said. She was taken to a hospital in St. Louis.

The Illinois Law Enforcement Alarm System Tactical Response Team rushed to the home on St. Mary, and police were told that Dodson had several weapons. It was unclear at what point he shot himself.
