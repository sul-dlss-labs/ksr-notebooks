Wilmington Police have released the name of a man who died in custody Sunday night.

Police say 28-year-old Deomain Hayman went into cardiac arrest shortly after officers took him into custody in a driveway of a business in the 1700 block of Wawaset Street. He was pronounced dead after being transported to Wilmington Hospital.

According to police, they caught up with Hayman on foot after he allegedly led them on a high-speed car chase. Police say Hayman resisted arrest and struggled with officers.

A preliminary investigation indicates officers twice attempted to use tasers on Hayman –but the tasers malfunctioned each time. The six-foot, 353 pound Hayman was eventually subdued by four officers and multiple sets of handcuffs. After he was seated in an upright position, police report Hayman appeared to go into cardiac arrest. Officers took off the handcuffs, performed C-P-R and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived.

Wilmington police continue to investigate the incident. The State Medical Examiner’s office has done an autopsy on Hayman to determine an official cause of death, but has not released its findings yet.
