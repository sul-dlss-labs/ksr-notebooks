The brother of a man who was being sought in connection with a domestic violence incident was shot and killed by a Rialto police officer who was responding to a San Bernardino home early Friday, officials said.

The incident came after the Rialto Police Department responded to a domestic violence incident in Rialto at about 1 a.m. The investigation led them to a nearby home along the 2800 block of West Birch Street in San Bernardino, San Bernardino Police Department Lt. Timothy Crocker said.

They were looking for Cesar Leonel Zamora, 35, who was accused of beating a woman causing “significant injury” and committing several other felonies, according to a news release from San Bernardino police.

About 2:10 a.m., four Rialto officers approached the Birch Street house where Zamora was believed to be.

They knocked and Zamora’s brother, 30-year-old Hector Cisneros Soria, answered the door while holding a .40 caliber semi-automatic handgun in his hand, police said.

Officers asked Soria to step out and he refused, instead raising his gun toward police, according to the news release.

“Upon seeing the firearm, the officer closest to Soria fired his duty weapon before he was able to shoot at them,” the release stated.

Soria was pronounced dead soon after. It is unclear how many times he was shot.

No officers were injured during the incident.

Zamora, who wasn’t at the Birch Street home, was arrested by San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department officials during a traffic stop in Hesperia a short time later, police said.

The San Bernardino Police Department is investigating the shooting.
