Deputies are investigating what led up to an off-duty DeLand Police officer fatally shooting his uncle during a family squabble Friday night.

Officer Bobby Harrelson, 51, told investigators he opened fire inside his home on Tradewinds Drive in Deltona Friday night to protect his mother, 76-year-old Hazel Hinds, sheriff’s spokesman Gary Davidson said.

He told deputies his uncle, Raymond Davis, 68, started choking his mother during a heated argument in their living room shortly before 6:30 p.m., Davidson said.

Harrelson reportedly said he tried to break up the fight between the siblings, but was unable.

When deputies arrived, Davis was already dead, Davidson said. No one else was home when the shooting happened, Davidson said.

Detectives interviewed Harrelson and Hinds Friday night. No charges have been filed in the case, Davidson said.

There haven’t been any other reported domestic incidents at the home in the past five years – only calls for medical assistance and a burglar alarm going off.

Harrelson was previously investigated in 2012 after he opened fire in a residential neighborhood injuring two men. DeLand Police said one of the men picked up what looked like a rifle and pointed it at Harrelson before he opened fire and struck both men. The gun the men had was later found to be a BB gun.

A neighbor’s young child and family dog were injured during the incident.

An investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement cleared Harrelson in the shooting.
