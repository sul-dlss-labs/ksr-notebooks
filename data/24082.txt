TISHOMINGO, Okla. -- Law enforcement officers in Tishomingo shot and killed a suspect who crashed his vehicle into a patrol car on Tuesday night.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said Tishomingo police and Johnston County deputies got a 911 call about a boisterous argument at a residence in the 1400 block of North Elks Road. They encountered someone trying to flee in a vehicle.

"It's when police officers pulled in the driveway that he drove out of the driveway," said witness who wished to remain anonymous. "He was probably running... I don't know... 30, 35 miles an hour when he hit the cop car."

The suspect, identified as 39-year-old Justin Monjay, failed to stop after crashing into Tishomingo patrol car.

"He had his foot on the gas pedal," the witness told KTEN. "Engine road and smoke boiling everywhere... he never let off of it at all."

Two police officers and a deputy opened fire. Monjay was pronounced dead at Tishomingo Mercy Hospital.

The witness said the police gunfire was justified.

"Without question," he said. "He hit them hard enough and fast enough that if they would have been out of the vehicle, he would have killed them."

The OSBI said two Tishomingo officers were slightly injured in the incident.

Monjay's vehicle had as many as 10 bullet holes in the windshield.

The three law enforcement agents who discharged their weapons were placed on routine administrative leave and will not be named unless criminal charges are filed.

The OSBI is heading up the investigation into the incident and will report its findings to the Johnston County District Attorney's office.
