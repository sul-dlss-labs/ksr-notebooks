The male victim suffered stab wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. His identity is pending verification by the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office and notification to family members.

The female victim also suffered stab wounds and was taken to Ben Taub General Hospital in stable condition.

Officer M.J. Marin, who discharged his duty weapon, was not injured in this incident. Officer Marin, assigned to the Traffic Enforcement Division, was sworn in as an officer in September 2007.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant J. Roberts and Senior Police Officer R. Cervantes reported:

Officers responded to an assault in progress and saw the suspect stabbing his girlfriend on a second floor apartment balcony. As the officers made their way to the second floor, they then saw the suspect stabbing a male who had attempted to help the female. The officers drew their weapons and ordered the suspect to drop the knife. The suspect ignored the officers' orders and raised the knife to stab the male victim again. Officer Marin fired his duty weapon twice and struck the suspect. The suspect, still holding the knife, then turned towards the officers. Officer Marin fired a third shot, fatally striking the suspect.

As is customary in all officer involved shootings in the city limits, the incident will be investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, as well as the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
