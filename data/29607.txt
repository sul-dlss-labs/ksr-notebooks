Eureka, Missouri (KMOX) - A burglary suspect shot himself after a high speed chase ended with a police standoff on Interstate 44 in Franklin County. The Sheriff's Office says it started Thursday morning with the report of an open garage door on Goodes Mill Road in Washington, Missouri, suspecting a burglary had taken place. Surveillance video showed a suspect vehicle, which was located by deputies a short time later in Red Barn Mobile Home Park. Someone saw them, jumped into the vehicle as sped away, leading to a high-speed chase on the freeway.

Police in Pacific were able to catch up with the car, and pulled alongside. The report says a man driving pointed a gun at the police car, so it backed off and was able to disable the vehicle near the Six Flags exit in Eureka. At that point, a woman jumped from the passenger side and ran. She was detained. A standoff followed until the man inside pointed the gun at himself and fired. He was taken to a hospital but was pronounced dead. No identities have been released yet as the investigation continues.
