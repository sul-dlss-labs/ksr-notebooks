Suspect Takes His Own Life After Cantonment SWAT Standoff

A suspect took his own life after a several hour standoff with SWAT in Cantonment this morning.

The Escambia County Sheriff’s Office responded to the 100 block of Vaughn Avenue in reference to a suspect that had multiple felony warrants. Family members told deputies the man was armed with a handgun and making multiple statements about not going back to jail, according Major Andrew Hobbs, spokesperson for the Escambia County Sheriff’s Office.

The man left the scene and returned some time later, running back toward his house. SWAT and hostage negotiators were called in, believing the man was barricaded inside the home.

About four hours later, deputies were conducting a perimeter check when they found the man hiding underneath a neighboring home.

The man took his own life, according to Hobbs. No shots were fired by deputies.

The investigation is continuing. Further details, including the man’s name, have not yet been released.
