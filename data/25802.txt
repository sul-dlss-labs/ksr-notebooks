One person is dead following an overnight officer-involved shooting in Chickasha, according to Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation officials.

Police were called to investigate an officer-involved shooting that occurred Wednesday at 9:45 p.m. near 7th Street and West Texas Avenue, officials said.

The call was originally a domestic disturbance call. The suspect, identified at 47-year-old Kevin Samuel Capers was allegedly threatening his girlfriend with a knife, the OSBI reports.

When officers arrived at the scene, they found a couple in the middle of the argument. Capers threatened the officers and refused to put his knife down, officials said.

Capers was shot by officers and died at the scene, police said.

"The officers attempted to defend and did defend themselves from the attacker and now we have one deceased inside the residence," said Chickasha Police chief Kathryn Rowell.

No other injuries were reported.

The officers involved will be put on administrative leave.

This is a developing story.
