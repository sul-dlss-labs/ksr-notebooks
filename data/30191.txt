CASPER, Wyo. (PRESS RELEASE) - – Shortly before 4:00am Thursday morning, Casper Police Officers were involved in an incident that resulted in a use of force action.

At 3:54 am, police say officers were in the area of East H Street and North Elma Street in Casper when they attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle. The two officers approached the vehicle to speak with the two occupants inside. At one point, the driver unexpectedly exited the vehicle, while the passenger moved into the driver’s seat and allegedly attempted to flee the scene.

One of the officers contacted the driver, the other officer began to take actions to stop the fleeing vehicle. Despite the second officer’s efforts, the new driver accelerated from the scene at a high rate of speed while the officer, still inside the vehicle with the driver, continued to order the driver to stop. Eventually, the vehicle entered onto the Interstate, into the oncoming traffic lanes.

During the course of this event, the officer fired their weapon at the suspect driving the vehicle, and then safely stopped the vehicle along the side of the Interstate. That suspect was pronounced deceased at a local hospital.

The primary Officer involved sustained no serious injuries. The second officer involved in the incident was uninjured and did not fire their weapon.

The investigation has been turned over to the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigations (DCI), a third-party State agency, for a thorough and independent investigation. The two officers involved in this incident have been placed on paid administrative leave. This action has been taken, pending a full investigation by DCI.
