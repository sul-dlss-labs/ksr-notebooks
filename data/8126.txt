BUTLER, MO -- An Oklahoma man was killed Wednesday afternoon in Missouri by a man fleeing from police.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol says 40-year-old Joe Nowlin of Vinita died when a suspect's vehicle crashed into his truck on U.S. 71.

Nowlin was chief of security at the Northeast Correctional Center in Vinita.

According to friends and relatives, Nowlin and his 14-year-old son, Cayden, were returning to home after traveling to see Cayden's younger sister perform in a play.

The wreck happened about 4:15 p.m. about 40 miles south-southeast of Kansas City.

Missouri authorities were chasing 26-year-old Nicholas Schilling south on U.S. 71 when Schilling's vehicle crossed the median and slammed his Ford Focus head-on into Nowlin's northbound Silverado pickup truck.

Schilling also died in the crash.

Troopers say the chase began when Belton, Missouri, police tried to arrest Schilling in an assault case.

Police said Schilling was driving in excess of 100 miles per hour and had gone about six miles when he crossed the median and hit Nowlin's pickup.
