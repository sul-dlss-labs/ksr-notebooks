A 58-year-old man was shot by police after a foot chase Sunday morning in Phoenix.

Officers were called to the area of Monte Vista Road and 32nd Street shortly after 8 a.m. Sunday following reports of a burglary, according to Sgt. Alan Pfohl, a Phoenix police spokesman. Police said the owner of the home had an order of protection against the man.

"The suspect had lived at the house previously and had returned to gather some property," Pfohl said. "While on the way to house, officers also learned the suspect had an outstanding misdemeanor warrant."

After police arrived, the man fled the backyard by jumping the fence, Pfohl said. An officer chased the man on foot through a nearby apartment complex, where a struggle ensued, he said.

"The officer was able to push the suspect away and draw his Taser," Pfohl said. "As the officer did this, the suspect removed a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at the officer. The officer dropped his Taser, removed his handgun and fired at the suspect, ending the threat."

The man was taken to a nearby hospital for surgery. As of Sunday evening, he remained in critical condition.

Detectives recovered a loaded handgun from the scene, Pfohl said.

The man was the 22nd person to be shot by law enforcement in Maricopa County in 2018.
