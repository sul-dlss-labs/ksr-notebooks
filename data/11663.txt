One person is dead after an officer involved shooting in Madison.

MADISON COUNTY, AL (WAFF) - A Madison woman who was shot in an officer-involved shooting Saturday morning had a history of mental illness, according to court records.

Deborah Jo Day, 55, was diagnosed with a condition called Schizoaffective Disorder - a medical illness with symptoms such as loss of contact with reality and mood problems - in 2004.



The records indicate a mental evaluation was requested by a circuit court judge when Day was scheduled to stand trial for credit card fraud.



The report, filed by forensic examiner Dr. Randal Burleson in 2004, said Day had a history of treatment for "severe psychiatric illness" dating back to 1993.



Day was shot near her home on Michael Avenue in Madison sometime before 4 a.m. Saturday.



Investigators said Madison Police responded to the area after receiving several calls stating Day was threatening to shoot neighbors with a handgun.



When officers arrived at the scene they found Day was armed. Investigators said officers repeatedly asked Day to put her weapon down but she raised her weapon toward them and was shot.



Day was taken to Huntsville Hospital where she died of her injuries; no officers were hurt.



Per policy, the officers involved in Saturday morning's shooting have been placed on administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated. Their names have not been released.



The Madison County Sheriff's office is handling the investigation.
