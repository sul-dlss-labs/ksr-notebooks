BROKEN ARROW – A man fatally shot himself during a standoff with Broken Arrow police officers Saturday morning, police said.

Around 10 p.m. Friday, police responded to the 8600 block of Willow Springs for a report indicating John Murray, Jr., 60, was involved in a case of possible child abuse, Broken Arrow Cpl. Leon Calhoun said in a release. When they arrived, officers reported seeing Murray holding a handgun while inside a vehicle parked in the driveway.

Murray refused multiple requests to place the handgun on the floorboard of the vehicle, and he made suicidal statements throughout the altercation, Calhoun said. Murray did not point the weapon at police, he said.

At about 3:30 a.m. Saturday, officers heard “what sounded like a gunshot” come from inside the vehicle, and they found Murray dead inside the vehicle shortly after.

Police did not specify details about the child abuse complaint.
