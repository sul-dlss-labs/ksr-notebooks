GOODLAND – A man suspected of hitting and killing a rural Goodland woman as she rode a bicycle in northern Benton County on Thursday shot himself Saturday as police came to arrest him for his role in the fatal hit and run, Benton County Sheriff Don Munson said Monday.

According to Benton County police, investigators had been looking for Eddie Norris, 44, or Wadena, since the Thursday evening crash that killed Marguerite “Peggy” Morgan, 75, of rural Goodland.

According to court documents filed in Benton County, a witness told police that they saw a black Dodge Dakota pickup truck, with Norris behind the wheel, driving north on Benton County Road 150 East at nearly 100 mph. Later that evening, witnesses told police, they found Morgan and her bicycle in a ditch on Benton County Road 150 East, near Benton County Road 900 North, about eight miles north of Fowler and about 40 miles northwest of Lafayette. Morgan had been riding about a mile-and-a-half from her home, according to court documents.

According to the court documents, witnesses later saw Norris and asked him about damage to a side headlight on the passenger side of his truck. They told police that Norris said he’d hit a deer more than a week earlier.

Police say that they found Norris on Saturday at the home of friends near Wadena. According to police, the homeowner gave permission to check the house for Norris and that when they arrived he showed a pistol and hid in the house. Police reported that a single shot was fired inside the home as an Indiana State Police SWAT team surrounded it. Officers later entered the home and found Norris dead from a gunshot wound.
