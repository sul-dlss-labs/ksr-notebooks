Authorities say a 25-year-old man police wanted to question following an armed robbery jumped into a river in Mount Clemens and apparently drowned.

The Macomb Daily says officers tried to stop the man before dawn Wednesday when he jumped into the Clinton River in the Detroit suburb. Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham says the man swam about half way across the river, then sank.

Authorities say the man was pulled from the water about 30 minutes later.

The dead man is identified as Scott J. Peabody of nearby Clinton Township.

Authorities say Clinton Township police responded to the armed robbery at a drug store, and sheriff's deputies thought Peabody matched the suspect's description.
