LOS ANGELES, CA â€” Authorities Friday identified a man who died after he allegedly pushed a teenager onto railroad tracks at a Metro subway station in downtown Los Angeles and then got into an altercation with construction workers nearby.

Husie Outing, 48, who was homeless, died at a hospital shortly after the series of events that began about 9:15 a.m. Wednesday at Metro's Pershing Square station at Fifth and Hill streets, according to the coroner's office and the Los Angeles Police Department. An autopsy was pending to determine his cause of death.

According to police, a 14-year-old boy waiting for a train was pushed by Outing onto the tracks. A subway train was approaching the station and was less than a minute away when the boy was pushed, said LAPD Detective Meghan Aguilar. The teen, aided by bystanders, was able to get off the tracks before the train arrived, police said. He suffered only a minor injury and was not taken to a hospital.

A short time later, Outing was taken into custody by police at Fifth and Flower streets, after getting into an altercation with construction workers. Witnesses said the suspect struck one of the workers in the head.

After being detained, Outing was taken to a hospital, where he died, according to police. NBC4 reported he went into cardiac arrest while being detained. Officers handcuffed Outing, but police said they didn't use a Taser or so-called less-than-lethal force on the man, ABC7 reported.
