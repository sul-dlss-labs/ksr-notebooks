CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO (KFVS) - A man was killed in a car crash while fleeing from Cape Girardeau Police.

Cape Girardeau County Coroner John Clifton identifies the man as James Michael Pyles, 35, of Cape Girardeau.



Tuesday, October 16 at approximately 5:31 a.m., officers from the Cape Girardeau Police Department were dispatched to the parking lot of 618 North St. in reference to a disturbance where witnesses stated that a man was in the parking lot threatening someone with a gun.

When officers arrived, they made contact with witnesses and saw the suspect vehicle leaving the parking lot.

When officers attempted to stop the vehicle, the driver failed to yield.

While traveling at slow speeds and obeying traffic control devices, police say the suspect vehicle continued to Perryville Road where it turned north. The suspect vehicle then accelerated in attempt to flee from the officer.

At Perryville Rd. and Rotary Dr., the suspect vehicle left the right side of the road and struck a tree at 5:41 a.m. Officers located a firearm similar to the one described by witnesses inside the vehicle.

Pyles was the only person in the vehicle. He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.
