Police say the deaths of a Springfield man and woman Wednesday night are likely the result of a murder-suicide.

Responding to a 911 call, police found dead Paul J. Dawson, 38, and Robin L. Cameron, 33.

“The findings thus far are consistent with that of a murder-suicide case. Physical evidence and witness statements indicate that Dawson shot and killed Cameron and then shot and killed himself,” according to a police news release.

Police are waiting, however, until the Greene County Medical Examiner declares the official cause of death to formally label the deaths as a murder-suicide, the release said.

The 911 call, made at 6:28 p.m., came from a girl who said her father had possibly shot her mother inside the Madison Street residence, Lt. Eric Reece said Wednesday.

The girl told police she and two siblings had escaped to a neighbor’s house.

Dawson and Cameron were an unmarried couple both living at the 2541 West Madison residence, spokeswoman Lisa Cox said. Cameron was the mother of all three of the children, while Dawson was the biological father of the two eldest children, according to Cox.
