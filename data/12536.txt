MODESTO-

Modesto Police have identified the elderly man killed in a March 21 officer-involved shooting as 87-year-old Howard Tungseth.

Tungseth had barricaded himself into his home on Evona Court and was in a standoff with officers for hours. He had his wife in the home with him, who reportedly had a medical condition that needed attention.

Police say when SWAT officers went into the home to get the woman, Tungseth approached them with a handgun.

He was shot by Sgt. Rigo DeAlba and and Det. Gary Guffey, 13 and 17-year veterans of the Modesto Police Department, respectively. No officers were injured in the shooting.

Tungseth reportedly fought in WWII.
