FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. â€” A former Wilbraham, Mass., man was fatally shot on the front porch of his Victoria Park home on Sunday after police said he charged at them with a knife.



Police said Fort Lauderdale police officers shot Jeffrey Lowry, 43, at 7:43 p.m. Sunday when he emerged from his house at 300 NE 17th Ave. and ignored orders to drop a knife he was wielding.



Lowry's wife, Susan Cunningham-Lowry, 43, told the Sun-Sentinel of South Florida that her husband did not have a knife.



Both Jeffrey Lowry and his wife graduated from Minnechaug Regional High School in Wilbraham in 1988. They married in 2009 and have a 2-year-old daughter.



Police said officers gave Lowry verbal commands to drop a weapon and he refused.



In a press release, police said officers secured the knife and gave first aid to Lowry while waiting for Fort Lauderdale Fire Rescue to arrive. Lowry later died at Broward Health Medical Center, police said.



Police said officers were responding to a domestic disturbance at the residence and a report of a man who was armed with a knife making suicidal threats.



Cunningham-Lowry told the Sun-Sentinel that she called two neighbors for help after her husband had threatened to kill himself with a butcher's knife. She said she asked a neighbor to call 911.



She said she saw the shooting take place as she watched from the front yard of a house next door.



Police said the shooting remains under investigation. The two officers involved are on paid administrative leave while the investigation continues, police said.
