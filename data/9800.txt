SAN FRANCISCO — A former San Pablo police officer has been cleared of shooting and killing a wanted parolee in 2011, a federal jury ruled Tuesday.

The group deliberated for just over 30 minutes before determining that Officer Mark Galios — who now works at the Vallejo Police Department — did not use excessive force when he shot and killed Akinlabi Minter, 33, on Jan. 18, 2011, according to Noah Blechman, Galios’ attorney.

“Everything added up, and I think the jury understood what happened,” Blechman said. “It was important the jury figured out what (Galios) did was a last resort to try to take this guy into custody and to preserve his own life.”

According to court documents, Minter was riding in a car that was pulled over by Galios at a gas station in the 2500 block of San Pablo Dam Road. During the stop, Minter and another passenger, who was on parole at the time, got out of the car and were instructed to get back in.

Minter, also a parolee, told Galios that he had to use the restroom and started to walk away, according to the suit. Galios pursued Minter, firing his stun gun at him but missing, the suit stated.

According to a police account of the shooting, the officer felt a handgun in Minter’s waistband while the two were struggling. Minter pointed the gun in Galios’ direction, police said, and Galios drew his gun and fatally shot Minter.

The lawsuit stated that Minter was unarmed and not threatening Galios when he was shot, calling the shooting an “unlawful execution.”

The lawsuit was filed by Minter’s grandmother on behalf of his five minor children.

“(Galios) was in a shoot or be shot situation, and he gave this guy many chances to give up and he never did,” Blechman said.
