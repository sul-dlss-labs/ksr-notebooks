ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO â€” A 14-year-old boy was shot to death by police inside a church after pointing what turned out to be a BB gun at officers, authorities said.

Dominic Montoya had also threatened his mother, neighbors and church members with the gun before he was shot twice Wednesday night, police said. The BB gun resembled a semiautomatic pistol, Detective Jeff Arbogast said.

Cindy Harrison, minister of education at Taylor Ranch Baptist Church, told The Albuquerque Tribune that the boy came to the church seeking help.

Three police officers, investigating a report of an armed teen, confronted Montoya. They fired after he spun around pointing the gun, Arbogast said.
