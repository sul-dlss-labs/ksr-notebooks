ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI)– A St. Louis family speaks out after losing a second loved one to a speeding driver. It happened at Lee and Fair.

There is no way to console the Jones family. In less than three years they will have buried two young women killed by drivers who were fleeing police.

The first in December of ’09 a pursuit launched by an unlicensed Uplands Park officer cost Lashana Jones Snipes her life.

The second just last Saturday happened at Lee and Fair. Jasmein Jones, 23, was killed when a white Impala heading east on Lee at a high rate of speed struck the car Jones was in.

St. Louis police say the patrol car had broken off the pursuit. But family members say that does not put an end to the danger.

The family is hoping to meet with others who faced similar losses to forge a new approach to handling fleeing suspects.

At the same time they are trying to find the resources to pay for yet another funeral. Jasmein Jones worked as a certified nurse assistant and leaves behind a three year old son.
