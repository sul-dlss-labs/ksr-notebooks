HOUSTON — A series of collisions led to the death of a 23-year-old driver Monday morning on Highway 290, according the Houston Police Department.

The crash led to a more than six-hour freeway closure in both directions, including the HOV lane, all of which have since reopened.

The situation unfolded at 2:05 a.m. on Highway 290 near W. Tidwell Road.

Investigators said a silver Toyota Scion was driving westbound when the driver went out of his lane and struck a white Chevrolet Malibu, causing both vehicles to spin out. That’s when a silver Chrysler 300 was reportedly struck by the Toyota, which then hit the concrete barrier of the HOV lane twice.

According to police, the Toyota driver was ejected from the vehicle upon hitting the barrier and landed on the opposite side of the freeway, where a Harris County Pct. 4 constable deputy hit him with a patrol car.

Lastly, investigators said an 18-wheeler — which wasn’t involved in the initial crash — struck debris left in the westbound lanes.

HPD confirmed the Toyota driver died at the scene and the Chrysler driver was taken to the hospital in stable condition. No other injuries were reported.

Police said all the drivers remained at the scene until emergency crews arrived. Investigators said the Precinct 4 officer was taking a prisoner to the Joint Processing Center when the crash happened.

None of the drivers involved showed signs of intoxication, police said.

However, investigators said an uninvolved driver who was stopped in a moving lane of traffic moments before the crash has been arrested. He was taken into custody and charged with driving while intoxicated.

The incident remains under investigation, and no names have been released.
