The Clackamas County District Attorney's Office will not present the case of a Colton man killed by deputies to a grand jury because the death was ruled a suicide, Chief Deputy District Attorney Greg Horner said.

On Feb. 15, Clackamas County Sheriff's Office deputies responded to a 911 call from a man claiming a person had been stabbed by someone who had a gun.

Deputies encountered Bruce Lee Steward when they arrived. Steward, 34, was holding a hatchet and refused the deputies' order to drop the weapon.

Steward was fatally shot by several deputies when he moved toward them with the hatchet, a Sheriff's Office spokesman said at the time.

The 911 call came from Steward's cell phone. Deputies did not find a stabbing victim.

The state Medical Examiner's office ruled that the death was a suicide, Chief Deputy DA Greg Horner.

In a prepared statement released Tuesday, Horner said:

"It is the long standing policy of the Clackamas County District Attorney's Office to present to the grand jury investigations of officer involved shooting deaths.



"However, this office has not submitted confirmed suicides to the grand jury for review. The shooting death of Bruce Lee Steward has been ruled a suicide by the Medical Examiner's office.



"Additionally, the law enforcement investigation supports this conclusion. As a result, this case will not be submitted to the grand jury for review."

The deputies involved, Mark Nikolai, Scott McBride and Joshua Eagle, are back on duty.
