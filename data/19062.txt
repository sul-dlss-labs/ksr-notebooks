The Spartanburg County Coroner's Office has released the name of a robbery suspect who reportedly took his own life after exchanging gunfire with deputies Friday afternoon.

Coroner Rusty Clevenger said that Carson Glen Keen, Jr., 34, of Spartanburg was pronounced dead at 5:31 p.m. at Spartanburg Regional Medical Center.

Authorities said Friday that a man, later identified as Keen, robbed the Family Dollar, located at 630 Highway 221, around 4:45 p.m. Friday. Officers with the Spartanburg County Sheriff's Office, Spartanburg Public Safety Department and the S.C. Highway Patrol responded to the area near the Beaumont mill village and tracked Keen to the intersection of Barnwell and Greenhill roads.

Keen reportedly fired at law enforcement, and a brief exchange of gunfire took place before Keen fled into a fenced in area of a nearby business and shot himself.

Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright said Friday that the robbery suspect fit the description of a suspect in several robberies. Friday's was the third robbery of a business in as many days, although officials haven't confirmed whether the incidents are connected.

On Wednesday night, a man armed with a silver-colored handgun robbed The Corner Stop at 720 Hayne St. On Thursday night, authorities think the same man armed with a silver-colored handgun robbed the Li'l Cricket at 250 Garner Road. The suspect in Friday afternoon's robbery also reportedly had a silver-colored handgun, according to information relayed to officers during the pursuit.

Clevenger said an autopsy to include toxicology testing is planned for Saturday afternoon, and the case remains under investigation by the S.C. Law Enforcement Division, the sheriff's office and the coroner's office.
