Tempe police said that two people were injured, including a police officer, and one person was killed in a police shooting that occurred after a domestic-violence call escalated into a stabbing at an apartment complex north of Loop 202 early Tuesday afternoon.

Officers were responding to a call regarding a domestic violence situation at a complex near College Avenue and Curry Road around 12:35 p.m., police said.

Tempe police officers arrived at the front door of the residence, heard screaming, and made an emergency entry to assist the victim, according to police.

Upon entering the residence, a female Tempe police officer was stabbed by a male suspect with a knife, investigators said.

As a result, several officers at the scene shot the knife-wielding man, said Molly Enright, a Tempe police spokesperson.

The man, 25-year-old Matthew Metz, was pronounced dead late Tuesday afternoon, police said. The officer was in stable condition.

Police said a woman at the apartment suffered severe stab wounds that investigators believe the suspect inflicted.

The female officer who was stabbed has been with the department for at least 15 years, according to officials. The officer's injuries are not life threatening, but she will be in the hospital for some time, said Lt. Michael Pooley, a Tempe police spokesman.

"It appears she's going to be OK," Pooley said.

"This was a very dangerous situation for our officers," Pooley said. "They immediately responded when they heard that the victim was in trouble. And she was in trouble."
