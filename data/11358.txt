The man shot and killed during an officer-involved shooting Saturday has been identified as 22-year-old Gray Alan Combs Jr.



Combs was wanted on three felony counts of producing child pornography, three felony counts of possessing or reproducing child pornography with intent to distribute, and one misdemeanor count of consensual sexual intercourse with a minor.



Police went to the 5700 block of Backlick Road in the Springfield area just after 11 p.m. Saturday for a report of a wanted person hiding in a bedroom.



Combs had been stopped the night before and allegedly gave officers false information about his identity before escaping following a brief chase on foot.



The suspect refused to surrender when confronted by police Saturday night, authorities said, threatening them with a sword.



Officers fired live ammunition and bean-bag rounds after making several demands for the man to surrender, police said.



Combs was struck and later pronounced dead at a local hospital.

The investigation is ongoing.
