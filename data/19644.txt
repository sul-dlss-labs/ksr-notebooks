(LOUISVILLE, January 6th, 2005) -- A Louisville Metro Police Officer shot and killed a man who police said lunged at officers with a knife Wednesday night in south Louisville. WAVE 3 Investigator Eric Flack reports.

It happened a little before 8 p.m. in an alley near the intersection of Taylor Boulevard and Lynnhurst Street. That's when 40-year-old Donald Neifert of Louisville, wanted for an outstanding EPO warrant, was cornered by four undercover Louisville Metro police officers.

The four officers had been approached by a woman as they were eating at a Dairy Queen on Taylor Blvd. She told them that her husband had an arrest warrant against him and was two blocks away.

When the officers confronted Neifert, police say he pulled a knife and lunged at one of the officers.

White says officers maced the suspect, but he kept approaching the officers, so Officer Jason Lainhart fired three shots, two of which struck Neifert, who died at the scene, said Jefferson County Deputy coroner Eddie Robinson.

A man who lives nearby -- who did not want to be identified -- heard the confrontation. "They was just like, 'drop it!'" he said. "They were cussing back and forth for about 10 seconds, and then I heard three shots."

None of the officers was injured.

All of the officers involved are on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation, which is standard procedure.

Chief White says Officer Lainhart has been on the force five to seven years.

This shooting comes weeks before Metro officers are issued tasers which could be used instead of firearms in situations like this.

But the Chief would not speculate if tasers could have saved the suspect's life.
