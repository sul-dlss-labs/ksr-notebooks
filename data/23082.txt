Michael Smith

Christopher Barbee

Two inmates escaped from the Desoto County jail over the weekend. One of them was caught Monday evening and is headed back to jail. The other was shot to death in Memphis Monday morning.

Memphis Police are now investigating the shooting that happened in Overton Park, near the intersection of Poplar and Tucker.

It happened in the middle of the park. Officers say the fugitive was driving a stolen van and tried to run them over.

The man pronounced dead at the scene was Michael Smith. Investigators say Smith died inside a car that he'd stolen from the jail parking lot.

Park visitors say it was the perfect day to be outdoors until shots rang out in Overton Park. Federal Marshalls shot and killed a fugitive just outside the golf course clubhouse .

"They were working an informant in the area they came upon this individual. During the attempt of an arrest there were shots fired," says Lt. Joe Scott with Memphis Police Department.

It all happened while Turrell Fox and his fiance were scouting out a place to hold their upcoming wedding. "This is a big shock, a bit shocking, really it is," says Fox. "In the Midtown of Memphis, something like this happening is just crazy," adds Fox.

"So many innocent children and bystanders out here they could have been used as a shield," says park visitor Gene Parkey.

Michael Smith was in jail for violating his probation. Christopher Barbey also escaped Saturday. He was captured Monday afternoon in Desoto County and is on his way back to jail.

Park visitors are relieved that no one else got hurt.
