The suspect in an officer-involved shooting in Hattiesburg died around 9 p.m. Friday at Forrest General Hospital, according to Forrest County Coroner Butch Benedict.

Benedict said the man's identity is not being released until he can be positively identified.

Around 1 p.m. Friday, a Hattiesburg police officer spotted someone driving down the road who appeared to be a suspect in a burglary and credit card fraud, Hattiesburg police spokesman Lt. Jon Traxler said.

When the officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop, the suspect failed to respond.

The suspect's vehicle eventually was stopped at Old Airport Road and Att Avenue in the Palmers Crossing area of Hattiesburg, where he fled on foot. The suspect allegedly fired shots at the officer in pursuit, who returned fire, striking the suspect.

The officer, who was not identified, was not injured, Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain said.

The Forrest-Perry County district attorney's office and the MBI were also at the scene conducting an investigation, which is routine whenever an officer is involved in a shooting.

Benedict said the man's body would be sent to Jackson for an autopsy.
