mtoups@indymedia.org On Thursday March 24, New Orleans Police Department officers shot and killed a 25-year old man in the 9th Ward. 25-year old Jenard Thomas was fatally shot by two NOPD officers, Scott Rodrigue and Joseph Waguespack Jr., who allege that he pulled a gun while fleeing the police.



The shooting happened at about 11 p.m. on Thursday, March 24, near the intersection of Piety and North Robertson streets in New Orleans' 9th Ward.



The victim's father said his son was wrongly targeted.



"They didn't come out here and say, 'Police,' or nothing," said Jerry Thomas, father of Jenard Thomas, in an interview with WDSU TV. "Only one of them got out with a gun. They came out to kill to kill him. That's my son they shot for nothing."



NOPD did not give any reason for chasing Thomas other than the fact that he fled police when he saw them coming. The officers have been placed on administrative reassignment and the District Attorney is investigating the shooting.
