WEST DES MOINES, Iowa – One person is dead after a motorcycle collided nearly head on with an SUV late Wednesday night.

At about 11 p.m., West Des Moines officers spotted a motorcycle that they thought might be stolen at 4th and Ashworth. It matched the description of a motorcycle stolen two days ago.

The officer turned his vehicle around to get the license number on the bike, but the driver took off at a high rate of speed.

Police say the driver sped down 4th Street without headlights. He turned onto Railroad and was heading west on Railroad when an SUV turned north in front of him.

The driver of the motorcycle, Trent Bennett, was thrown into a yard. Paramedics took him to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The driver and the passenger in the SUV were not injured. However, the driver of the SUV, Thomas Holland, 30, was arrested for OWI.

Sergeant Ken O’Brien with the West Des Moines Police Department said this pursuit and crash happened very fast.

“From the dispatch logs it was exactly one minute and one second from the time the officer called out this investigation to the time of the crash. So these things play out very, very rapidly,” Sgt. O’Brien said.

O’Brien says at this time they do not have an estimate of just how fast the motorcycle was traveling but he says witnesses told him it was very fast.

The Iowa State Patrol is investigating the incident. O’Brien says the department tries to bring in a second agency when it is involved in an event where a death occurs.
