Investigators believe the driver, who they identified Friday as Laurel resident Malik Emmanual Britton, tried to make an illegal U-turn onto the southbound lane of I-95 at a “high rate of speed." Britton, 24, eventually lost control and was struck by a tractor-trailer, police said.

Britton was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore on Thursday and died of his injuries. Authorities on Friday identified Jonathan Asare Somuah as the front-seat passenger of Britton’s vehicle. The 21-year-old Silver Spring resident also was pronounced dead after being transported to shock trauma, according to a police press release. Neither were wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, police said.
