What began with a report of three men shoplifting over-the-counter drugs from a CVS on the Upper West Side has ended with an arrest for the hit-and-run death of a noted documentary editor, whose credits include “The Fog of War.”

The editor, Karen Schmeer, was “one of the greatest editors of her generation,” said Greg Barker, the director of “Sergio,” a documentary for which Ms. Schmeer won an editing award at the Sundance Film Festival in 2009.

Ms. Schmeer, 39, was crossing Broadway at 90th Street just before 8 p.m. on Friday when she was run down by a rented 2010 Dodge Avenger sedan, the police said. She was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Luke’s-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

The police had been chasing the car, which matched the description of the shoplifters’ getaway car given by a clerk at the drugstore, at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. Patrol officers tried to pull the car over, but the driver eluded them, hitting another automobile on 87th Street before running down Ms. Schmeer.
