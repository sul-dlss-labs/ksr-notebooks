A bank robbery suspect was fatally shot yesterday when he pulled what turned out to be a phony handgun on an FBI agent at an Eastern Shore motel.

The handgun was a pellet pistol, said Special Agent Peter A. Gulotta Jr., a spokesman for the FBI's Baltimore division.

Gulotta identified the dead man as Peter Jerome Gebbia, 32, of Lothian, Anne Arundel County.

He said Gebbia was charged with taking $1,700 at gunpoint from Allfirst bank in the 2000 block of Somerville Road in Grasonville, Queen Anne's County, on Dec. 12.

In that incident, the gunman threatened to shoot bank employees and demanded large bills, Gulotta said.

Gulotta said an investigation led agents yesterday to the Chesapeake Motel in the 100 block of Hissey Road in Grasonville, where Gebbia had been staying for an unknown period of time.

About 3 p.m., the FBI's resident Annapolis agent and two county sheriff's deputies stationed themselves in the lobby while a clerk telephoned Gebbia's room and asked him to come to the office to fill out a registration form.

Gulotta said when Gebbia entered the office, he was confronted by the Annapolis agent, who told him he was under arrest. Gebbia then reached into his coat or waistband and pulled out a handgun, Gulotta said, and the agent shot him once in the chest.

Gulotta said Gebbia had pulled a pellet pistol.

"We regret the loss of life," Gulotta said, "but the man was charged with armed robbery, and the agent and the other officers involved in the attempt to apprehend [him] had to assume he was pulling a real gun from his clothing."

Noting agency policy, Gulotta refused to name the resident agent.
