The Garland County sheriff's office have identified a Garland County man who was fatally shot Saturday night after he purportedly pointed his gun at an officer.

Shortly before 10 p.m., officers responded to a disturbance report of yelling and glass-breaking at 165 Stanage Terrace, Garland County deputy Scott Hinojosa said.

Officers arrived at the home, knocked on the door and identified themselves to the residents inside, Hinojosa said. Officers then ordered the residents out of the house, and then heard "what sounded like the action of a firearm being operated," according to Hinojosa.

Hinojosa said officers took cover at different points around the front yard before they saw a man, identified as 39-year-old Chris Sample, exit his home with a gun. Sample was ordered to drop the gun, Hinojosa said, but instead he pointed it at deputy Josh Cannon.

Sample was shot by officers and died at the scene, Hinojosa said. No officers were injured in the shooting.

Hinojosa said Cannon — who responded to the report with Arkansas State Police — has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is the office's policy on all officer-involved shootings.

A joint investigation between the Arkansas State Police and the Garland County sheriff's office is ongoing, Hinojosa said.
