Relatives of a man who was fatally shot by a police officer during a 2003 raid on a labyrinthine storage warehouse in Chelsea settled a lawsuit against the city yesterday for $3 million, saying they considered the money an apology from the city for his death.

Relatives of the man, Ousmane Zongo, 43, a West African immigrant, accepted the settlement in Federal District Court in Manhattan after two years of litigation.

During that time, the officer, Bryan A. Conroy, was tried twice for the killing, producing a mistrial on manslaughter charges, a conviction for criminally negligent homicide, and a sentence of five years’ probation and 500 hours of community service. He was also fired from the Police Department. He has appealed his conviction and sentence.

Those trials also produced a strongly worded critique of the department from the judge, Justice Robert H. Straus of State Supreme Court in Manhattan, who said Mr. Conroy was “insufficiently trained, insufficiently supervised, insufficiently led.”
