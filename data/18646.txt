A man was killed during an officer-involved shooting in Pomona Wednesday night, officials said.

The incident was reported about 7 p.m. in the 900 block of North San Antonio Avenue when a 911 call was placed to report a man shooting into an apartment, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department officials, who are assisting the Pomona Police Department.

Pomona officers responded and found the suspect walking in the area of East Columbia Avenue and North San Antonio Avenue with a handgun, authorities said. An officer-involved shooting then occurred, according to a statement from LASD.

The suspect then fled into an alley behind the apartment building he had been shooting into, where the man exchanged gunfire with police, officials said. The suspect was fatally wounded and pronounced dead at the scene, according to LASD.

Ultimately, three officers discharged their weapons at the man, deputies said. None of the officers were injured, they added.

Preliminary investigation indicated the suspect had entered a residence on San Antonio Avenue where he shot a man in his upper torso, wounding him, before shooting a woman in her upper and lower torso, authorities said. The suspect fled and then fired into a second residence shortly before officers responded, according to LASD.

The two victims were transported to a nearby hospital and are in fair condition, officials said.

A handgun believed to have been used in the crimes was recovered at the scene, detectives said. However, the suspect’s motive and whether he knew the victims remains under investigation.

The suspect’s identity was unknown, deputies said.
