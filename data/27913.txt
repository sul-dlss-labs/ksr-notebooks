A man was killed in a one-vehicle crash during a police chase early this morning in Marshall County, the authorities said.

The man, identified by the authorities as 40-year-old Christopher Chad Petty of Texas, died at the scene of the crash.

Petty lost control of a stolen vehicle that left the road and hit a tree off Pleasant Grove Road near Guntersville, according to the sheriff’s office.

Moments before the chase began, the vehicle was reported stolen, said Sheriff Phil Sims in a statement. A deputy spotted the vehicle and began the pursuit near Albertville.

At the sheriff’s request, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is investigating the crash. State troopers were called to the scene around 4:15 a.m., said Derek Campbell, a state law enforcement spokesman. He declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.

Steve Guthrie, a sheriff’s spokesman, said the crash involved only the stolen vehicle. Sheriff’s deputies weren’t injured, he said.

In addition to the high speeds and efforts to evade the deputy, weather may have been a factor in the deadly crash, Guthrie said. Rain was falling on Marshall County when the crash happened.
