Alphonse Edward Perkins, a 50-year-old black man, was killed in an officer-involved shooting with a Los Angeles Police Department officer Monday, Sept. 8, in Vermont Knolls, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 2 a.m., patrol officers responded to a domestic violence call at a home in the 1100 block of West 81st Place, according to a news release from the LAPD. The 911 operator said that gunshots were heard in the background.

When officers arrived, they were confronted by Perkins, who allegedly fired a gun. “An officer-involved shooting” occurred, according to the release.

Perkins was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:38 a.m., said Ed Winter, the assistant chief of the coroner’s office.

A handgun was recovered at the scene. Inside the home, officers found a woman who had been shot in the shoulder. She was taken to a hospital and is expected to survive.

The department has not yet released the name of the officer or officers involved. The Homicide Report will update this entry once the name (or names) is released.
