Armed Suspect Fatally Shot by Metro Police Officer at 6500 Main

May 6, 2009 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed suspect by an on-duty Metropolitan Transit Authority police officer in the 6500 block of Main about 10:20 a.m. on Tuesday (May 5).

The male suspect, 40, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. His identity is pending verification by the Harris County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Metro Police Officer R. L. Harrington, who discharged his duty weapon, was not injured in this incident.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant J. J. Brooks and Senior Police Officer M. F. Waters reported:

Metro Police Officer J. P. Zepeda attempted to detain the suspect after being notified by a citizen who said he had just been assaulted by the suspect near Fannin and MacGregor. Metro PD Officer Zepeda then requested assistance and Metro PD Officer Harrington arrived in the 6500 block of Main. The suspect then went towards both officers with a knife. Fearing for his life and the life of his fellow officer, Metro PD Officer Harrington then discharged his duty weapon several times and fatally struck the suspect.

As is customary in officer-involved shootings occurring in the city limits, this case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide Division and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
