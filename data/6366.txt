CICERO â€” A Cicero man who had a heart attack Sunday morning while in police custody died of natural causes, a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said Monday.

Guillermo Pon, 49, of the 1800 block of 51st Court was involved in a traffic accident early Sunday and was taken into custody after Cicero police discovered he had an outstanding warrant. While sitting at a booking desk, Pon complained to officers that he was experiencing chest pains, said Cicero Town spokesman Dan Proft.
