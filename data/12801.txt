RALEIGH, N.C. — A Wake County deputy fatally shot a woman Friday afternoon after she charged at him and two other deputies with a knife, Sheriff Donnie Harrison said.

Someone called 911 at 11:45 a.m. to report that a woman was breaking into a home at 6232 Melbourne Road and was threatening the caller with a garden rake, Harrison said. When deputies arrived 10 minutes later, they found a woman breaking into a second home at 6222 Melbourne Road.

Misty Michelle Mullins and her boyfriend rented that home until a couple weeks ago, the property owner said. The pair had broken up, and Mullins was no longer listed on the lease.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

"We found out there was a domestic violence order pending at that residence. She was not supposed to be there," Harrison said.

The man had a protective order against Mullins, 33, saying she had assaulted him on April 25 and had threatened him with a knife and a baseball bat, according to court records. The order bars her from the 6222 Melbourne Road home and the man's workplace.

Deputies tried to persuade Mullins to come out of the home. When she wouldn't, they entered.

Mullins then charged at the deputies with a machete, witnesses said, and they used a stun gun to try to subdue her. When that failed three times, Deputy Gabriel Romero shot and killed her.

The names of the other two deputies involved haven't been released. None was injured.

"Anytime we have something like this, it's a tragedy for both sides – our family and the family that's involved," Harrison said.

Romero is on administrative duty, pending a State Bureau of Investigation review of the incident. Harrison said he hasn't decided whether the other two deputies also will be taken off patrol until the outside review is complete.
