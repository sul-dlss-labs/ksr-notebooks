Two Little Falls police officers and two Morrison County sheriff’s deputies were justified in using deadly force against a man in December, according to a review released Thursday by Crow Wing County Attorney Don Ryan.

Ryan’s review of the shooting death of Patrick Glenn Jeske, 37, found that Jeske was depressed, suicidal and fired at least one shot at officers who confronted him early Dec. 30 at the residence of an acquaintance in northeast Little Falls. Jeske was shot six times and died at the scene.

The law enforcement officials who fired their weapons were identified as Little Falls police officers Jon West and Joshua Burgardt and Morrison County sheriff’s deputies James Paschelke and Shawn Larson.

Ryan’s review said Jeske had told others he intended to kill himself that night. As officers confronted him, Jeske made movements that indicated an intent to fire the shotgun he was holding.

Jeske fired one shot from the shotgun at about the same time as officers fired at him, Ryan wrote. Ryan relied, in part, on squad car video of the incident in describing what happened that night.

Jeske clearly was trying to commit suicide by cop, Ryan wrote, and officers had no choice but to defend themselves.
