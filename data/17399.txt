BIRCH RUN, MI -- A fatal police chase involving an armed man from Clio began when his wife called to have his welfare checked because he was distraught and suicidal, authorities say.

William John Jennings, 49, died when he crashed in a ditch off northbound I-75 near Birch Run Road in Saginaw County after a police chase that started at Clio Road in Genesee County around 12:30 p.m. Saturday, March 12.

A medical exam completed Monday, March 14, showed that Jennings died from injuries sustained in the crash and from lack of seat belt use, said Lt. David Kaiser with the Michigan State Police.

The chase began after Jennings' wife called 911 to have police check on his welfare, saying he was distraught, suicidal and had a gun, Kaiser said.

Michigan State Police troopers responding to the call located him driving northbound on I-75 near Clio Road in Genesee County around 12:30 p.m. and attempted to pull him over, according to a Michigan State Police news release.

He did not stop, and a chase ensued. Troopers following the vehicle saw Jennings brandish a handgun several times, the release says.

Authorities tried using spike strips to deflate his tires, but he was able to avoid them, according to the release.

Troopers then used a PIT maneuver to end the pursuit before other motorists were harmed, the release says.

A PIT maneuver is a technique used by law enforcement to immobilize vehicles during a pursuit. An officer uses the front corner of their vehicle to make contact with the back corner of the fleeing vehicle, causing it to spin and come to a stop.

When troopers did the PIT maneuver, the vehicle slid off the road into a ditch alongside the expressway at I-75 and Birch Run Road in Saginaw County.

Jennings was unresponsive after the crash. First aid was attempted, but did not work, and Jennings was pronounced dead at the scene.

Funeral arrangements were not yet announced as of Monday afternoon, March 14.
