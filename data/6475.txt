DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A man authorities said shot three people outside a Des Moines bar was shot and killed by an undercover police officer early Sunday.

Christopher Byrd, 23, was involved in an altercation inside Hoppers, a local bar. The undercover officer, Sgt. Wade Wojewoda, was watching the bar following the fight, said Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Todd Dykstra.

Wojewoda returned to the Hoppers parking lot an hour later and heard gunshots. Byrd shot two people before Wojewoda arrived at the scene, Dykstra said, and Wojewoda then saw Byrd shoot a third person.

Wojewoda's emergency lights were flashing, Dykstra said, when he drove into the parking lot in an unmarked vehicle. Wojewoda, who was in plain clothes, "yelled commands" at Byrd to drop his weapon.

"Mr. Byrd then focused his attention on Sgt. Wojewoda and pointed his gun at Sgt. Wojewoda," Dykstra said.

Wojewoda fired one shot at Byrd, who died at the scene. Wojewoda has been paid administrative leave, which police said is standard procedure.

The two men and a woman who were shot by Byrd were taken to local hospitals, Dykstra said. Tiffany Hernandez, 25, Christopher Collett, 28, and Rickson George, 29, were all treated at local hospitals. Their injuries do not appear to be life threatening.

Police said that their investigation indicates that the shootings stemmed from an earlier altercation inside the bar. Authorities believe that two of the three people Byrd shot were not intended as targets.

In January 2004, police and city leaders said they were considering taking action against Hoppers after a 32-year-old Des Moines man was found stabbed in the stomach outside the bar.
