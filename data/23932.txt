The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating the circumstances that led an officer to fatally shoot a man Friday afternoon in Jonesborough.

TBI said just before 1 p.m., the Jonesborough Police Department received a complaint concerning possible drug activity at a hotel located along East Jackson Boulevard.

Upon arrival, officers encountered a man in the parking lot. The man displayed a large knife and threatened to harm himself before leading officers on a foot pursuit, the TBI said, according to its preliminary investigation.

The foot pursuit crossed over East Jackson Boulevard and ended in the 400 block.

Officers continued to give the man orders to drop the knife, but he refused to comply, the TBI said.

At some point during the second confrontation, the man reportedly moved toward one of the officers with the knife.

The situation further escalated and resulted in the officer firing his service weapon, striking the man, the TBI said. The man was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No officers were injured.

The TBI did not release the names of the officers or the man who was killed.

The incident is one of three police shootings in the state that the TBI was investigating Friday.

A Clarksville police officer shot a man after a standoff at an apartment complex Friday afternoon, and a Tullahoma Police officer shot and injured a man when attempting to serve him an arrest warrant.

TBI agents will submit the findings of their investigations to the district attorneys general for review.
