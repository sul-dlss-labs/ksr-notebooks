Police were responding to a sexual assault Wednesday morning in Union City when a man shot himself in the head, an official from the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office confirmed.

The 57-year-old man, whose identity has not been released, killed himself inside his home on Bergenline Avenue near 21st Street at approximately 5:15 a.m., authorities said.

Police had responded to the apartment building on the report of a sexual assault that morning and were met by the alleged victim -- a juvenile female -- who directed them to suspect's second-floor apartment, HCPO spokesman Ray Worrall said.

There, they were "confronted" by the armed man, who then shot himself in the head. At some point during the confrontation, an officer used a taser on the man, although when the device was used is under investigation, Worrall said.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Additional details on the alleged sex assault, as well as the age of the victim, were not provided.

The incident remains under investigation. Anyone with information is asked to contact the HCPO at 201-915-1345 or to leave an anonymous tip on the agency's official website.
