GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) — Two Grand Junction police officers involved in the shooting death of a 29-year-old man have been cleared to return to work.

Police announced Thursday that an internal affairs investigation found that the actions of Cpl. Clint Newtown and Officer Patrick Bridge were consistent with department policy. Chief John Camper says the officers can return to duty when they are ready to do so.

The Daily Sentinel (http://bit.ly/1uoJSGY) reports that police haven’t explained what let up to the Aug. 25 shooting that killed Josh Crawford, a cook and hip-hop artist. The coroner said he died of a gunshot wound to his chest.

Officers were called to remove him from a home and found him in a car parked outside. A police log entry on the shooting says that a “known male threatened officers with a handgun” but police have refused to elaborate.
