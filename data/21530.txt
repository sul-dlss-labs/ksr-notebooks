Lynde has a criminal record

Lynde has a criminal record going back to 2001, according to news reports. In June 2001, Lynde led local and State Police on a chase in Central Massachusetts after he kicked the door of a liquor store, according to the Worcester Telegram & Gazette archives.

Lynde allegedly drove into a police cruiser. He hid in his home and told authorities that he had firearms and would use them, the newspaper reported.

Police forced their way into the house and found Lynde, then 33, sleeping in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor, the Telegram reported.
