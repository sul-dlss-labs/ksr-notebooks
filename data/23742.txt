CLAREMONT, Calif. (KABC) -- A 69-year-old man was killed and four others were injured after the female driver of a stolen pickup truck drove westbound on the eastbound lanes of the 210 Freeway Monday, striking oncoming cars head-on.

Several vehicles were involved in the deadly crash that claimed the life of Daniel Castillo of Fontana.

The 28-year-old suspect was identified as Nicole Thibault of Santa Clarita. She was seen being handcuffed to a gurney after rescuers pulled her from the smashed truck in the wake of the crash.

The chase began at a San Bernardino 7-Eleven, where police said the suspect stole the truck with a 2-year-old boy in the back seat.

The suspect dropped the child off on the sidewalk before getting on the freeway.

All lanes of the eastbound 210 Freeway in Claremont are back open after the deadly wrong-way crash shut it down for several hours.
