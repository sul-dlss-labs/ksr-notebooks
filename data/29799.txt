Search for man accused of killing mother-in-law is over

SUGAR LAND, Texas (KTRK) -- The man wanted for allegedly shooting his mother-in-law to death Thursday night in Cypress was located Saturday evening in Sugar Land.

Harris County Sheriff's SWAT team found 32-year-old Gregorio Gaytan behind a strip center near Highway 6 and Settlers Boulevard around 5 p.m.

A single gunshot was heard as SWAT team members held a secure perimeter around Gaytan. Moments later, he was found dead with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Deputies had been searching for Gaytan since he allegedly shot his mother-in-law 50-year-old Esmeralda Alaniz Thursday night outside of his home.

The shooting occurred after 9 p.m. when Alaniz had rushed over to Gaytan and her daughter's home after receiving a call from her daughter that he was holding her and their two children at gunpoint.

Sugar Land police were investigating the scene where he was located.
