The Winnebago County district attorney’s office said Wednesday that the fatal police shooting of an armed suicidal man was justified, according to the Appleton Post-Crescent.

Wilson Lutz, 66, was shot by a Town of Menasha police officer April 19 at his apartment complex. According to police, Lutz had called emergency dispatchers saying he was suicidal and when an officer responded, Lutz had a 12-gauge shotgun in hand. Lutz refused to drop the gun, which was later found to be unloaded, and an officer fired two shots, hitting Lutz in the head and hand.

Lutz also had contact with Appleton and Fox Valley Metro police earlier on the day he died, the newspaper reported.

On April 19, 2013 at 5:05pm officers were sent to an apartment in the 200 #blk of W. Calumet St. after the Winnebago County 911 center received a call from a man who stated that he “wanted to end my life” and told the call taker that he was armed with a loaded gun.
