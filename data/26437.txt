Garland police opened fire on a man who they say was holding two machetes at an apartment complex Friday night.

It happened around 10:30 p.m. in the 200 block of E. Interstate 30 at the Lake Village North Apartment Homes complex.

When two officers got there and confronted the man, identified Sunday as 52-year-old Jason Xavier Salas, he was advancing towards officers and not obeying commands, police said. The two officers discharged their weapons and struck Salas.

David Sutton was about to leave his home Friday night when he heard the commotion.

"Basically it was one shot after another. Bang, bang, bang, bang â€“ like that," Sutton told NBC 5.

Salas, a Dallas resident, was taken to Baylor University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, police said.

Police said Salas damaged some vehicles at the apartment parking lot by stabbing the hoods of vehicles and slashing tires. One of the cars belongs to Lisa Bolton.

Bolton said she has lived at the complex since June.

"My back tire had been stabbed, from what it looks like. I'm very sad about what happened, because now I don't know if I feel all that safe," Bolton said. "You want to believe there's good people out there, but there's crazy nuts out there."

Garland police homicide detectives, along with the Dallas County District Attorney's Office of Public Integrity responded to the scene.

Both officers will be placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy.

"I just think it was a sad thing, to be honest with you, completely all around. You'd hate for something like to happen," Sutton said. "The guy that got shot for example, he's got a mother. He's somebody kid, but at the same time, I wasn't there, so I will never judge unless I see things and stuff."
