Friends and family are mourning the death of Drew Eldredge, 21, of Escalon, who was critically injured in an accident earlier this month and taken off life support earlier this week.

The crash occurred during the early morning hours on Saturday, Jan. 18 and left Eldredge hospitalized in critical condition, after he rolled his pick-up truck over into an orchard.

Posts on his Facebook page came from many friends and fellow motorcycle riding enthusiasts, offering condolences to the family and sharing memories of times spent with the local resident.

According to his page, Eldredge, who lived in Escalon, was a member of the class of 2010 at Connecting Waters Charter School.

Information from the San Joaquin County Sheriffâ€™s Department regarding the accident indicated that Eldredge fled the scene when deputies attempted to stop him on suspicion of driving under the influence near River and Sexton roads shortly before 2 a.m. on Jan. 18. Officers gave chase and the crash occurred nearly seven miles away from the original attempted traffic stop. The truck ran into the orchard on Van Allen Road, near the intersection with Dodds Road. Escalon and Farmington fire department crews both responded to the scene, the call coming in around 2:15 a.m. of the rollover crash with a pin in.

Eldredge was taken to a Modesto hospital with critical injuries following the accident.
