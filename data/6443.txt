Birmingham police today identified a man shot fatally shot by a West Precinct police officer as Christopher Ogletree.

Ogletree, 47, was pronounced dead at University Hospital Monday night after police say he confronted the officer with a knife.



The incident began shortly after 7:30 p.m. when the officer, whose name hasn't been released, was called to 1053 40th Street Ensley on a report of a mentally disturbed man. The officer then issued an urgent radio call for assistance. A confrontation occurred and one shot was fired by the officer.



Police have released little information. Witnesses and neighbors at the scene Monday night said a man, believed to be Ogletree, lived with his mother at the house and had been sitting outside in the yard day and night for several days. Many residents, they said, had grown concerned about his welfare.



The shooting is under investigation by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation and Birmingham's Internal Affairs Division.
