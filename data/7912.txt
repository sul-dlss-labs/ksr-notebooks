A man behind the wheel of a vehicle that killed an elderly woman in a car crash in Brighton while

fleeing from police Wednesday nig

ht was driving a stolen car from Georgia and was also wanted on a felony warrant from Tennessee, authorities said today. Deputies will seek warrants on Marvin Leonard Brown, 29, once he is released from the hospital, said Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Lt. Randy Christian. "It is incredibly sad that this poor woman lived for 86 years and her life gets taken by a common thug simply because he couldn't face consequences and take responsibility for his actions," Christian said.

Investigators today released more information about the 5 p.m. wreck that killed Willie Lee Williams, 86, and injured her grandson, 30-year-old Christopher Williams.

The chase started just before 4:30 p.m. when a Midfield police officer stopped Brown driving a four-wheeler on Wilkes Road. Brown, authorities say, was nervous and police determined he had given them a fake name. As the officer continued to talk with him, Brown sped off on the four-wheeler, Christian said.

After a short chase, Brown ditched the four-wheeler and got into a Honda Accord. The chase continued.

Midfield police lost sight of the car near Huntsville Avenue in Brighton. A few seconds later, police reported the Honda had wrecked at the intersection of Huntsville Avenue and 49th Street. Christian said Brown ran a stop sign and struck the pickup truck, causing it to flip.

Investigators have not yet been able to interview Brown or Christopher Williams. Both are believed to have non-life-threatening injuries.

Brown's felony warrant from Tennessee is for probation violation. The outstanding Bessemer warrant is for giving false information to a law enforcement officers.
