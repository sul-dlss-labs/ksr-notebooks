A Georgia State Patrol trooper was fired on Friday for driving too fast before a crash that killed two teenagers.

Trooper Anthony J. Scott, 26, was driving 91 miles per hour just seconds before the Sept. 26 crash in Carroll County that killed two Paulding County teenagers, WSB-TV reported.

Four teenagers were in the vehicle, the backseat passengers Kylie Hope Lindsey, 17, and Isabella Alise Chinchilla, 16, were killed.

Scott was treated and released from Tanner Medical Center in Carrollton.

According to reports, Scott had slowed his vehicle to 68 mph when he hit the teenagers' vehicle.

The post speed limit was 55 mph.

"At the time of the wreck, he was on no kind of emergency call, en route to no accident, not trying to stop a vehicle," Capt. Mark Perry told WSB-TV. "Turns out he was running at a high rate of speed through this intersection in a territory that's he's familiar with and should have known the dangers that potentially exist."

Georgia State Patrol initially said the teenagers' vehicle failed to yield, but later it was revealed Scott's excessive speed was a contributing factor to the fatal crash.

WSB-TV reported that Scott was disciplined for two prior crashes.

The investigation's findings will be turned over to the District Attorney's Office.
