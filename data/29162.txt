A man killed when he was hit by a patrol car driven by an on-duty Benicia police officer has been identified by authorities.

Scott Hamers, 48, died early Wednesday after being hit in what Benicia Interim Police Chief Mike Greene called “a tragic incident for all involved.”

The officer hit Hamers with his patrol car around 2 a.m. in the 1900 block of East 2nd Street, police said. The area is just north of Interstate 780 where the road goes below an underpass.

The Solano County Coroner’s Office released Hamers’ identity but said they did not have a city of residence listed for him.

At the request of Benicia police, the California Highway Patrol’s Multi-Disciplinary Accident Investigation Team is investigating the case, CHP spokesman Officer John Franzen said. The Solano County District Attorney’s Office also is investigating.

Authorities have not identified the officer or detailed what occurred in the collision.

“Until it’s finalized and goes through the checks and balances between the two agencies, we can’t release the cause of the collision,” he said. He also did not have a timeline for when authorities may release more information.

Authorities removed the officer from the scene immediately, according to a statement from Benicia police. He remains on paid administrative leave.
