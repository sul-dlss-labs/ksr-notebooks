---------------------------------------------------

(Feb. 15, 8:04 a.m.) Two yet unidentified people are dead and two more are injured following a police chase and crash on Ga. Highway 36, south of Covington, Thursday evening.

Accoding to Georgia State Patrol spokesman Gordy Wright, a Honda Accord was traveling at a high rate of speed on Ga. 36 and illegally passing vehicles on double yellow lines. A patrol officer saw the Accord breaking the law and began following the Accord, which was traveling north toward Covington.

"The trooper activated his lights and siren to try and stop the vehicle but the driver refused to stop," Wright said in an email. "Near Cedar Creek Drive, the Honda driver lost control while passing a vehicle, began rotating and traveled broadside into the oncoming travel lane. There the Honda Accord was hit in the side by a Honda Pilot.

"The driver and passenger of the Honda Accord were killed in the crash and the driver and passenger of the Honda Pilot have been transported for treatment," Wright said around 11:56 p.m.

Wright said the patrol car did not come into contact with any vehicles.

The identification of the two deaths is pending notification of the families.
