PHOENIX – The man fatally shot by Mesa police this week rushed at officers while holding two knives, authorities said Thursday.

The suspect, identified as 31-year-old Craig Dandy, was pronounced dead at the scene after the shooting Wednesday morning at an apartment complex near Southern Avenue and Dobson Road.

Dandy reportedly was brandishing a knife and yelling for someone to “take their best shot” before officers arrived in response to a call, police said.

Witnesses said Dandy charged the officers, police said. One officer shot Dandy with his firearm while “another simultaneously discharged his less lethal shotgun,” Detective Nik Rasheta said in an email.

No officers or bystanders were injured.

The investigation into the incident was ongoing.

It was the first shooting of 2020 involving the Mesa Police Department and the 14th involving law enforcement in metro Phoenix, according to data tracked by KTAR News 92.3 FM.
