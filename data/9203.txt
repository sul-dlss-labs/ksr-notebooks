Homewood police officials said this afternoon it would be premature and unreasonable to comment on the weekend death of a Birmingham teen who died after a confrontation with police.



William Owens, 17, was struck twice with a Taser when he resisted arrest after being caught breaking into cars at Herzing University about 1 a.m. Sunday, authorities said. He was pronounced dead at UAB Hospital less than two hours after being hit with the police stun gun.



The officer is on leave pending investigations underway by the Jefferson County Medical Examiner's Office, the Alabama Bureau of Investigation and the Jefferson County District Attorney's Office.



In a statement released by Homewood Lt. Ken Atkinson, police said they will not comment further until the investigations are complete.



"To do otherwise would pose a substantial possibility of confusing, delaying or compounding an independent and objective analysis of the matters at hand, and would be grossly unfair to all parties involved," the statement read.



Officers were called to the 200 block of West Valley Avenue just before 1 a.m. on a report of a group of teens breaking into cars. The first officer arrived and called for backup.



Two suspects fled and were caught after a brief foot chase. Owens resisted and a scuffle followed, authorities said. He was twice hit with the stun gun before officers were able to handcuff him. Once he was handcuffed and face down, the officers went to check on the other suspects. When they returned to Owens, he was unresponsive, authorities said. Paramedics arrived at 1:03 a.m., Curry said, and took him to UAB Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:46 a.m.



Homewood police Sgt. Andrew Didcoct said police today are looking at charges against the other teens involved in the car break-ins, but no arrests have yet been announced.
