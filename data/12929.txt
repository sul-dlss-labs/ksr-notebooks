TALLADEGA COUNTY, Alabama - A 21-year-old Childersburg woman was killed Monday when her Camaro collided with an SUV at a Talladega County intersection, Alabama State Troopers said today.

The crash happened at 5:19 p.m. Monday at the intersection of Alabama 21 and Grist Mill Road, which is about four miles north of Winterboro, said trooper spokesman Sgt. Steve Jarrett. Ronniekca Garrett was pronounced dead on the scene. Authorities said she wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

Jarrett said the driver of the Suburban, 43-year-old Christopher Cook of Sylacauga, was airlifted to UAB Hospital. He is listed in critical condition. A third vehicle had minor damage from crash debris.

Jarrett said a preliminary investigation shows Garrett was driving at a high rate of speed at the time of the crash. A trooper on patrol saw her driving over the speed limit on Grist Mill Road and tried to initiate a traffic stop. Garrett's vehicle accelerated to high speeds, Jarrett said, running a stop sign and then colliding with Cook's SUV.

The crash remains under investigation. Jarrett said it wasn't clear whether Cook was wearing a seatbelt.
