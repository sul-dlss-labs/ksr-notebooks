The brother of a 33-year-old man shot by police early Friday wants to know why his brother is dead.

Luis Jobel of Guatemala was killed by an officer during an fight that occurred in the 6700 block of Hayvenhurst Avenue in Van Nuys around 3:30 a.m.

Police received a call about a man causing a disturbance, throwing rocks and possible vandalizing property.

Police said they shot Jobel after he refused their commands to surrender.

"No weapon," Victor Jobel said. "Just those little stones over there."

"I don't know other than the rocks," LAPD Sgt. Albert Gonzalez said. "Whether he armed himself with anything other than that I don't know yet."

Residents in the area said they saw three men arguing and kicking cars. They heard multiple gunshots and police sirens.

"It's was pop, pop, pop, pop, multiple shots, multiple shots," resident Nikki Greene said.

It was unclear what led to the officer-involved shooting, but police said Jobel was throwing rocks before the shooting.

Police did not say what he was throwing rocks at.

"A rock can be a very deadly weapon," Gonzalez said.

Jobel's brother told NBC4 that his brother had fallen on hard times and was drinking lately.

The pool worker was arrested earlier in the week for disobeying a restraining order his ex-wife had placed on him.

An investigation into the shooting was underway as police tried to determine whether deadly force was justified.
