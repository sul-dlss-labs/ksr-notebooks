The Spartanburg County coroner on Friday identified a woman who died after a shootout with deputies, but it's still unclear if she took her own life.Jennifer Mabry Robinson, 34, of Spartanburg, was taken to Spartanburg Regional Medical Center Thursday night after the incident, according to Coroner Rusty Clevenger. She later died at 9:06 p.m., he said. Clevenger said Robinson was shot twice in the head."The decedent had a gun shot wound to the mandible area of her face and another gunshot wound near the temporal area of her head," he said.There was another gunshot wound to Robinson's him, but that appeared non-fatal, Clevenger said.The incident began Thursday after 8 p.m. when deputies tried to pull over Robinson and found out her tags were expired and might have been stolen, Sheriff Chuck Wright saidThat is when Robinson started a chase and began shooting at deputies on John Dodd Road while she was driving, according to Wright.Deputies were able to stop Robinson's car near New Cut Road, and a brief foot chase started.Robinson pointed the gun at the deputies, they fired two shots and she turned the gun on herself, Wright said. "It appears she took her own life, but we did fire shots at her," Wright said. The deputies were put on administrative leave.The deputies were not injured. Clevenger said microscopic testing will determine the manner of death. That will reveal whose gun fired the fatal shot.The coroner says the preliminary cause of death is a gun shot wound to the head.As in all officer-involved shootings, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating the incident.
