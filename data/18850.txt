Mother Of Fatal Accident Victim Blames Police For Crash



ROCK HILL, S.C. -- A teenager has died after the stolen car he was riding in crashed into a utility pole. The mother of the victim blames the driver of the stolen vehicle and the police.



It's not clear yet how fast the teen was driving the stolen car, but police said speeding and alcohol were involved.



Jamil Rhinehart, 17, was a sophomore at Southpointe High School. He died a day after the crash on Fire Tower Road south of Rock Hill Saturday night. Meshawn Rhinehart is his mother.



"That was my first born, my oldest son, and it's senseless what happened," she said.



Police said the car Rhinehart was a passenger in was stolen Thursday. An officer spotted it at Main and Black streets. According to police, they tried to pull over the driver, 18-year-old Nathan Adams, but he didn't stop.



Police said they chased him about a mile down Fire Tower, until he slammed into a utility pole.



Rhinehart is angry and said the police should not have chased the teens over a stolen car.



"No, that was endangering not only the lives in the car, other lives, other cars that might've been on the road that night," she said.



Rock Hill police said the officers followed policy and though they regret the teenager's death, the pursuit was appropriate.



"Stolen car is a felony. It's all according to guidelines and department policy. We have to meet certain criteria. The officer went by the rules as far as we can tell at this time," said Rock Hill police Lt. Jerry Waldrop.



Police will review their policy and procedures as they do after any chase. They said it's too early to know whether this tragedy will lead to any changes.



Adams wasn't badly hurt. He's facing many charges still pending.
