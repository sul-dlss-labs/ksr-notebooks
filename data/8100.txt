Three people are dead and a fourth in police custody after a violent Saturday night that began with a murder in Berkeley and ended with a collision in Oakland that killed a motorist and a pedestrian.

The homicide in Berkeley triggered a police chase of the suspect's Cadillac around 6:40 p.m., Oakland police spokesman Jeff Thomason said today.

Police followed the Cadillac into Oakland and were tailing the speeding car east on Aileen Street when the Cadillac failed to stop at a stop sign at Martin Luther King Jr. Way, according to Thomason.

The Cadillac collided with a Mazda traveling south on Martin Luther King Jr. Way. The Mazda was forced east across the street and into a pedestrian on the sidewalk in the 5600 block of Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Thomason said.

The Mazda then crashed into a building at 5640 Martin Luther King Jr. Way.

The driver of the Mazda, a 26-year-old Sunnyvale man, was pronounced dead at the scene, Thomason said.

The pedestrian, a 41-year-old Berkeley man, died at a local hospital.

Meanwhile, the force of the collision with the Mazda sent the Cadillac into a Lexus traveling north on Martin Luther King Jr. Way, Thomason said.

The driver and passengers of the Lexus were transported to a local hospital with minor injuries.

The driver of the Cadillac, a 22-year-old San Leandro resident, was apprehended by Berkeley police officers, Thomason said.

All three deaths are being treated as homicides, according to police sources.
