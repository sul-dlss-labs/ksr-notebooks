ORLANDO, Fla. -- A University of Central Florida police officer was shot to death by an Orlando police officer outside the Citrus Bowl as fans were arriving for a college football game Saturday, authorities said.

Dennis Smith, a reserve officer for the Orlando Police Department who had retired after 25 years on the force, was put on administrative leave after shooting Mario Jenkins before the University of Central Florida's football home opener.

Jenkins, an undercover officer working with state agents to stop illegal drinking, was a four-year veteran with the university police who was in his late 20s.

Witnesses told the Orlando Sentinel that the incident started with Jenkins breaking up a tailgate party. When he encountered resistance, they said, he fired three shots into the air. Smith then saw Jenkins with the gun and shot him several times, the newspaper said.

Authorities believed a third person was involved, said Barbara Jones, spokeswoman for the Orlando Police Department. Jones refused to say if the person was injured.

A UCF student also was wounded in the fracas and was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center.

The shooting occurred before the University of Central Florida's victory over Marshall University.

"It's pretty freaky. You don't think you would see this at a UCF game," junior Nicole Jorgensen, 22, of Melbourne.
