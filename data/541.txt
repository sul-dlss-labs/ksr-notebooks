Police said Samuel Edwards, 42, was riding in a bike lane at about 11:30 p.m. Sunday when he suddenly cut in front of the Wentworth District sergeant's car as they both headed north in the 3700 block of South Cottage Grove Avenue.

Police said the sergeant could not avoid hitting Edwards, who was pronounced dead at Cook County Hospital.

The accident is being investigated by the Police Department's Major Accident Investigation Unit.

"I thought one of the shelves had fallen off of my kids' wall," said Dawn Allen, 31, who was in her kitchen in the Lake Grove Village apartments on Cottage Grove when she heard the accident.

Allen said she saw Edwards on the ground with his bike, an old 10-speed with a baby seat on the back. The police car's front bumper and hood were dented, she said.

"It looked like maybe he had hit a tree," Allen said.

Edwards was a quiet, nice man, said former neighbors in the 8000 block of South Champlain Avenue, where he lived for a few years before moving away several months ago.

"He was a Handy Andy-type guy," said former neighbor Mike Silas, 39. "He fixed cars, he cut grass. He did it all."
