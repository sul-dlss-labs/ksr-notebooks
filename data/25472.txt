Vinson said that one of the men was pinned underneath the cruiser and was pronounced dead on scene.

Dion Lamar Taylor, 20, of Baltimore was identified as the suspect that died.

Taron Donta Kelly, 16, of Rosedale, was the suspect arrested by police on scene. He faces several charges including armed robbery, armed carjacking, motor vehicle theft, possession of a handgun and being a minor in possession of a handgun. Kelly is being held in Baltimore County on a denied bail status.

Vinson said the officers involved were place on administrative leave and it's unclear if the officer's body camera recorded the crash. City police are investigating.
