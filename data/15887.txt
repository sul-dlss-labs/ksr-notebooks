Update: Police meet to review evidence in shooting.

A man who reportedly confronted police responding to a burglary call in East Portland has died.

Police responding to the scene found that the person who called in the burglary was struggling with the suspect, who then broke free and attempted to attack police with a knife, according to a Portland police bureau spokesman.

An officer then fired two rounds, injuring the man. He was given medical assistance and transported to a local hospital, but died, said spokesman Sgt. Greg Stewart. The bureau is contacting his next of kin before releasing the man's name. Nor has it identified the officer involved.

The assailant was "very, very close" to the officer, creating a very dangerous situation, Stewart said. "We're all just really thankful that he is okay."

Detectives are interviewing witnesses and officers. Also on the scene are investigators from the civilian Independent Police Review Division. Gail Shibley, a top aide to Mayor Charlie Hales, also responded, according to Hales spokesman Dana Haynes.

The incident occurred near an apartment complex in the 2300 block of Southeast 130th Ave.

East Precinct officers responded to a 911 call at about 5:30 p.m. Sunday. Dispatchers initially labeled the call a burglary, but the circumstances were "chaotic," and the exact nature of what led to the call remain under investigation, Stewart said.
