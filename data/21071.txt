The Enquirer, Battle Creek (MI)

A man the U.S. Marshals Service describe as a “major fugitive” and the subject of a nationwide manhunt was killed this morning in Battle Creek when he exchanged gunfire with police.

Battle Creek police officer Robert Miller, 32, was struck in the face with a ricocheted bullet as he crouched behind a police car in front of 54 Frisbie Avenue. Police said his injuries aren’t life-threatening.

Battle Creek police and the U.S. Marshals Service identified the dead man as 33-year-old Leroy Tyrone Wilson. Acting on a tip, a team of local, state and federal law enforcement agencies were attempting to arrest Wilson shortly after 8 a.m. on a warrant charging him supervised release violations.

When officers went to the door at 54 Frisbie Ave., Wilson apparently fired at them, striking a U.S. marshal in the chest. Police retreated and a woman and her three children, who were living in the house, also escaped; police then surrounded the house.
