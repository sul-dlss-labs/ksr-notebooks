A man who died in a shooting incident with police last week was shot multiple times in the chest after he fired on a police sergeant approaching his home, according to a preliminary autopsy report released Tuesday.

The Ramsey County Medical Examiner found that Timothy Scott Hanson, 55, died of multiple gunshot wounds. The report says that authorities do not believe that Hanson shot himself during the exchange.

Woodbury police officers arrived at Hanson's home around 11:30 p.m. on April 15 to respond to a domestic disturbance call. According to authorities, Hanson fired shots at Sergeant Omar Maklad as the police sergeant approached the house.

The two men exchanged gunfire, and Hanson was fatally wounded.

Maklad, 27, was struck twice. He suffered "serious but non-life threatening injuries," and was treated and released at Region's Hospital in St. Paul, the report said.

The incident in Woodbury is among several cases in which an officer was killed or wounded while responding to a domestic dispute. Last September, North St. Paul officer Richard Crittenden was shot and killed while responding to a domestic disturbance at an apartment building.
