It was a busy weekend for Upper Michigan law enforcement agencies.

A 21-year-old Iron Mountain man was killed Sunday morning when he crashed his motorcycle during a high–speed police chase.

Dennis Brzoznowski was observed going 85 miles an hour on M–95 near Sagola Sunday morning at about 9 Central time.

A Michigan State Police trooper gave chase but could not keep up with the bike.

The trooper lost sight of the bike but later came across debris scattered along the side of the road.

The officer found Brzoznowski near the wreckage of the motorcycle.

The man died at the scene.

Police say Brzoznowski may not have had his helmet strapped on properly.

Also, a Bark River accident that sent two people to the hospital is being blamed on alcohol, drugs and speed.

According to State Police at the Gladstone Post, the accident happened early this morning on Delta County Road 535 near 8th Road.

They say a pickup truck driven by a 28-year-old rapid river man left the road and rolled over numerous times.

It ended up in the middle of a farm field.

The rollover threw a 23-year-old passenger from the pickup.

Both men were taken to OSF St. Francis Hospital in Escanaba.

Their names have not bee released.

The investigations into both accidents are continuing.
