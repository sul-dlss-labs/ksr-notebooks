BELLFLOWER, Calif. (KABC) -- A wild police chase involving a possible car thief ended with an officer-involved shooting in Bellflower. One suspect was killed and another was taken into custody.

The chase began in Long Beach, where officers received a LoJack hit on a reportedly stolen vehicle out of Los Angeles around 6 a.m.
