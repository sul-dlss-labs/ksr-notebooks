An unarmed homicide suspect shot to death in a 27-bullet fusillade by New Jersey police officers at a Mercer County motel was identified yesterday as a troubled 45-year-old construction supervisor who had been living recently with a woman whose slashed body was found last week in his Fort Lee apartment.

The Bergen County prosecutor's office last night identified the woman as Michelle Schroeder-Carta, 30. Investigators also provided new details of Ms. Schroeder-Carta's slaying, saying it was the apparent result of a domestic quarrel, and the cause of the dramatic face-off that left the suspect dead, three officers injured and a tangled case under scrutiny by state criminal justice officials.

The suspect, identified by Bergen County officials as Richard Holtz, was killed late Thursday night in a confrontation with 10 officers at a Ramada Inn in East Windsor, where he had been traced by Bergen County detectives and Fort Lee police officers hours after the discovery of Ms. Schroeder-Carta's body.

The State Division of Criminal Justice said that six officers opened fire when Mr. Holtz rushed naked from his room into a dimly lighted second-floor hallway, threatened to shoot the officers and brandished a black object that turned out to be a TV remote-control device.
