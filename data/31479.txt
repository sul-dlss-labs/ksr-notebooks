Syracuse, N.Y. — A 36-year-old Nedrow man who was handcuffed in an ambulance died on the way to a hospital Tuesday, according to the Onondaga County Sheriff’s Office.

The man had been handcuffed because he was aggressive with ambulance crews trying to help him, according to a news release from the sheriff’s office today.

The man who died was Daniel Gibson.

The state Attorney General’s Office has taken over the investigation, according to Sgt. Jon Seeber, a spokesman for the sheriff’s office.

The AG’s office investigates all deaths that occur while someone is in police custody, Seeber said.

TLC ambulance and sheriff’s deputies responded to a home at 6:18 a.m. Tuesday on the 200 block of Hudson Avenue in the town of Onondaga, he said in the news release.

Gibson was unconscious so medical personnel administered Naloxone, a treatment for narcotic overdoses, he said. Within seconds the man regained consciousness but became physically combative, striking and kicking medical personnel and a deputy, he said.

Gibson ran out of the home abruptly and became increasingly aggressive towards personnel before becoming unconscious again, he said.

For the safety of the man and the personnel on the scene, Gibson was placed in handcuffs and transferred to a stretcher so medical personnel could treat him, Seeber said.

Gibson was placed in the ambulance but went into cardiac arrest on the way to Upstate Community Hospital. He was officially pronounced dead at the hospital a short time later.
