ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. – The Orange County Sheriff’s Office on Friday released the names of the deputy and the woman he fatally shot while investigating a burglary.

Sheriff’s deputies responded Thursday afternoon to Dehli Street when they were called by a homeowner, who said he was at work but was alerted about movement in his home via a home-security system.

"The homeowner received, I guess, some type of alarm notification and he had the ability to see within his home. He saw two individuals," Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings said.

The homeowner said when he opened the application he could see the suspects scouting out the TV in his living room. The camera has a speaker feature on it and he told News 6 he used it to yell at them.

His voice spooked them, and they ran off on foot, officials said.

Deputies were told the suspects ran west on Dehli Street.

Deputies searched a nearby building with guns drawn and saw a woman run to Mission Street, where she was confronted by Acting Sgt. Vernon Brown, a 21-year veteran with the agency.

"The deputy engaged that individual. That individual had a handgun in hand. It's unknown whether that person fired or not, but the deputy fired," Demings said.

The woman, identified as Deresha Armstrong, 26, died at the scene.

Detectives said they found the handgun she was carrying.

Brown was not hurt.

"The deputies are well-trained, and they're here to protect their lives, as well as the lives of other people, and unfortunately, sometimes we do have to use deadly force," Demings said.

Deputies continue to look for the second suspect.

Anyone with knowledge of the person who was with Armstrong is asked to call Crimeline at 800-423-TIPS.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, which is standard procedure.
