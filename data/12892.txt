FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP/CBS4) — Sheriff’s officials say a Livermore man who was fatally shot by a deputy Monday had called 911 to complain about a neighbor, then used a semiautomatic rifle to open fire on deputies who responded.

Larimer County coroner’s officials said Wednesday that Louis James Skelly, 60, died of multiple gunshot wounds.

A deputy had checked on Skelly on Monday afternoon after a neighbor reported gunshots and yelling but found no further action was needed.

Skelly later called 911 to complain about a neighbor and other issues. Sheriff’s officials say that as two deputies approached his property, Skelly fired his semi-automatic rifle. One deputy returned fire with his department-issued AR15 rifle, striking Skelly. He died of multiple gunshot wounds from the AR15. The deputies weren’t wounded.

No further action was taken during the first visit early Monday afternoon. But when deputies returned just before 6 p.m. to investigate complaints made by Skelly via 911 calls that afternoon, he started shooting a semi-automatic SKS rifle at them, according to the news release.
