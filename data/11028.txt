A preliminary autopsy report for an inmate who died Friday in the Potter County Detention Center showed he died of a brain aneurysm, authorities said Monday.

Robert Alex Boatright, 33, of Amarillo died in custody Friday after he had two seizures at the jail, authorities said.

About 3:05 a.m., Boatright was booked into the jail on charges of possession of a controlled substance and driving while intoxicated, records show.

About 1:35 p.m., medical personnel were called to the jailâ€™s booking room, where Boatright began having a seizure, Sheriff Brian Thomas said in a statement. Boatright then had another seizure and stopped breathing, Thomas said.

Emergency services arrived at the detention center about 1:45 p.m. and paramedics started chest compressions on Boatright, the statement said. Amarillo Medical Services took Boatright to the hospital, where doctors pronounced him dead at 2:40 p.m., Thomas said.

The Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit is investigating the death.
