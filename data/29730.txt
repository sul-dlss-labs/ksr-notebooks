Ringgold, GA (February 27, 2021) - On Saturday, February 27, 2021, at approximately 3:00 a.m, the GBI was requested by the Catoosa County Sheriff's Office to investigate an officer involved shooting that occurred at 12957 Alabama Highway, in Ringgold, GA.

Preliminary information indicates that the Catoosa County 911 Center received a suspicious call from the above residence so deputies responded to the residence to investigate.

Deputies had responded to the residence several times earlier the previous date, Friday, February 26, to serve a felony probation warrant on Fred Bowman “Bo” Trundle, 54 years old. Trundle lives at the residence.

Deputies arrived at approximately 11:15 p.m. at the residence and attempted to arrest Trundle. Trundle retreated from the backyard into the residence. Deputies used a taser in order to effect Trundle’s arrest, but it was not effective. Trundle ran into a bedroom as deputies attempted to call Trundle out of the room. Trundle exited the bedroom with a shotgun, threatening to shoot the deputies. In order to de-escalate and take more tactical positions, deputies exited the residence and began to negotiate with Trundle to surrender.

At approximately 11:57 p.m., Trundle exited the front door of the residence onto the front porch, Trundle refused to obey verbal commands from the deputies to drop the shotgun. Trundle then pointed the shotgun at the nearest deputy in a lethal manner. One deputy fired multiple times at Trundle , striking him. At approximately 2:30 a.m., after deploying chemical munitions, entry was made into the residence where Trundle was found fatally wounded from the gunfire.

No officers were injured during this incident.

The GBI will complete an independent investigation. Once complete, it will be turned over to the Catoosa County District Attorney's Office for review.
