Almost two months after a man was shot and killed during a police chase, authorities have released his name and the names of the five Murrieta police officers who fired their weapons.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, which is investigating the shooting, said that on Oct. 22, Junef Monzon, 31, of Garden Grove, crashed into multiple Murrieta police cruisers and drove toward officers, at which point the officers opened fire.

Sgt. Scott Montez and Officers Chris Zeltner, Kyle Mikowski, Zach Bradley and Blake Williams shot at Monzon, according to the Murrieta Police Department.

The names were released this week, following an assessment into the officers’ safety, in response to a California Public Records Act submitted by The Press-Enterprise days after the shooting.

A 2014 California Supreme Court ruling said names of officers involved in shootings have to be made public unless doing so would pose a specific threat to those officers.

The Murrieta officers, all put on administrative leave after the shooting per department policy, have returned to active duty, police said.

While police identified Monzon as a Garden Grove resident, a public records search turned up someone with the same name and month of death living in Temecula.

About 2 a.m. Oct. 22, Murrieta police officers spotted a stolen vehicle near Murrieta Hot Springs Road and Interstate 15, according to a sheriff’s news release.

The vehicle fled, leading police in a chase about 6 miles up the freeway before exiting on Bundy Canyon Road in Wildomar. The driver continued down city streets until crashing into a fence in the 32500 block of Mesa Drive, the Sheriff’s Department said.

That’s when the driver began striking police cars and drove toward the officers, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

After Monzon was shot, paramedics and officers tried to provide medical aid, but he died from his injuries.
