A 29-year-old woman was struck and killed during a police chase in Newark, prosecutors said.

Priscilla Godoy, 29, who lived in Newark, was struck as she crossed South 14th Street around 10:44 p.m. Saturday, the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office said.

Newark police were pursuing two men driving a stolen Jeep Cherokee who had carjacked a victim driving a 2011 Ford Taurus in East Orange at gunpoint. Police spotted the Jeep — which they believe had been involved in a shooting earlier that day — near Bergen and Chadwick, the prosecutor’s office said.

At some point during the pursuit, one of the suspects crashed into another driver, forcing his vehicle into parked cars and pinning Godoy between two of them, according to prosecutors.

She was taken to University Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at midnight.

Video from the scene showed a white Jeep crashed into an idling gray car, which then crashed into other cars parked along the side of a residential street. Another video showed the driver of the gray car slowly getting out of his vehicle while police lights and sirens surrounded the crash scene.

Police have yet to make any arrests, and an investigation is ongoing, according to the prosecutor’s office.
