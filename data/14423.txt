Daniel Ibarra, a 26-year-old Latino, was killed in an officer-involved shooting Tuesday, April 29, in the 100 block of North Gage Avenue in East Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

About 2:40 a.m., officers were responding to a report of a domestic disturbance on North Gage Avenue where they found a woman suffering from a gunshot wound to the neck, according to Sheriff’s Deputy Crystal Hernandez and coroner’s records.

Ibarra opened fire on the deputies a short time after they arrived, but none were hit, Hernandez said in a news release. The deputies removed the victim’s two children, ages 1 and 4, from the area, according to the release.

Ibarra then “made himself known” to the deputies, holding out a cell phone and a handgun. Officers with the department’s Special Enforcement Bureau arrived on the scene, and repeatedly ordered Ibarra to put his weapon down.

After a standoff that lasted over an hour, the deputies shot Ibarra several times. He was pronounced dead in the driveway of the home at 4:27 a.m.

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the Sheriff's Department's Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
