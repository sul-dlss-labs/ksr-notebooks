An autopsy has been completed on a Petal man who died Friday shortly after he was arrested on drug charges. 27-year-old Cheyenne Lee had a seizure at the Forrest County Jail and was transported to the hospital, where he went into cardiac arrest. Officials say it could be several weeks before they know the exact cause of death. Meanwhile, a Hattiesburg man who was injured in a car chase with police Friday has been released from the hospital and charged with eluding an officer. Police say 34-year-old Tony Hinton crashed his truck into a ditch on Columbia Street after fleeing from police when he was pulled over for a traffic violation.
