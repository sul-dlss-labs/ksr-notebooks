One Driver Dies, Another Injured After Pursuit

State Police say they are investigating a chase that ended in a highway death.

Twenty-nine-year-old Jeremiah Joseph Haas of New Windsor died after he attempted to flee from a deputy who tried to pull him over Monday morning, according to the Carroll County Sheriff's Office.

Police say the chase started with a high speed chase near Finksburg. Deputy 1st Class Brian Colussy was monitoring traffic when he observed a Dodge Ram 1500 truck approaching him at a high rate of speed on Cold Saturday Drive.

Deputy Colussy says he then turned on his emergency lights and signaled for Haas to stop. However, Haas continued speeding before turning onto Old Gambler Road and then, Old Westminster Pike. At this point, the deputy says he lost sight of the truck.

The deputy continued looking for the truck until it slammed into a van on Route 140.

Officials say Haas died at Carroll Hospital Center from injuries sustained in the crash.

The van's driver, 23-year-old George David Bopst of Westminster, was treated for injuries at the same hospital and was later released. The deputy was not injured, according to authorities.

The Sheriff√Üs Office Traffic Collision Reconstructionists as well as investigators from the Maryland State Police and Baltimore County Police are continuing to investigate the accident.

Anyone who may have witnessed the accident is encouraged to contact Corporal Glenn Day at (410)-386-2900.
