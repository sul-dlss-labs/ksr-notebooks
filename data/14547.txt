MARION, Ky. (AP) - Kentucky State Police say one person has been killed after a police pursuit in the western part of the state.

Troopers told WPSD-TV in Paducah (https://bit.ly/1owHRFL) Deandre White was traveling southbound early Sunday morning when a Marion police officer attempted a traffic stop.

Troopers say White failed to yield to emergency equipment and continued traveling southbound on KY 91 at a high rate of speed. White failed to negotiate a curve and left the shoulder of the roadway and hit a ditch. Whiteâ€™s vehicle then struck a culvert and overturned, ejecting him.

Police say White was not wearing a seat belt. The Crittenden County coroner pronounced him dead at the scene.
