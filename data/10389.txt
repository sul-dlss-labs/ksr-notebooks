Jose Torres, a 33-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Monday, July 18, in the 10400 block of Ilex Avenue in Pacoima, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers responded to a call about a "man with a gun, possible domestic violence" about 5 p.m., according to an LAPD news release.

As police were driving to the location, they saw Torres, who fit the description of the possible suspect. He was seated next to a woman near a brick fence. Officers got out of their cruiser and approached him, officials said.

The police gave several commands to Torres, who was sitting next to his estranged wife, authorities said. Torres then pulled out a gun and put it against his wife's head and body. Officers told Torres to drop the weapon, but he ignored them, officials said. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred.

Paramedics were called, and Torres was pronounced dead at the scene. Coronerâ€™s records show he was shot twice in the head and once in the torso.

Torres' wife and the officers were not hurt, officials said. A loaded semi-automatic handgun was recovered at the scene.

Foothill area detectives are investigating the initial domestic violence incident, and the LAPD Force Investigation Division is looking into the officer-involved shooting.

Anyone with information about either event is asked to contact detectives at (818) 834-3115. Those wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
