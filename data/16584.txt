A man was shot to death early this morning after a foot chase with police on Tucsonâ€™s south side near South Morris Boulevard and East Drexel Road.

Police identified the man as 40-year-old David Moreno Leon.

The incident began around 4:30 Sunday morning when police were called to a house in the 5800 block of South Southland Boulevard, said Sgt. Pete Dugan, a department spokesman.

Residents reported that a shirtless man was trying to break into a house.

Officers arrived and found a torn screen and began searching the area.

Minutes later, police spotted a shirtless man on a bicycle. A police officer tried to stop the man but the man rode off, then ran into the desert area near Morris and Drexel and police followed him.

At some point during the foot chase, the man pulled out a hand gun and an officer opened fire, Dugan said. The officer and firefighters tried CPR but the man did not respond.

The officer, Shawn Simmons, a three-year veteran, was not injured.
