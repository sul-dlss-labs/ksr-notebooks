The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office says the robbery, kidnapping and auto theft began around 2 p.m. on Jan. 3rd at Lucky Charms Arcade near the corner of Old Mayport Road and A1A. Police say that Hall fled the business, but police were able to track him down to the 900 block of Stern Drive South with help of citizen tips from the area.

It was in this area that police say Hall ran inside a home and kidnapped Louis Reese, 84, while stealing his car.

The pursuit ended on Atlantic Boulevard with the kidnap victim’s vehicle totaled and four people – the victim, suspect and two Jacksonville Sheriff’s officers -- in the hospital.
