An Anchorage officer shot and killed a man Saturday evening after the man stabbed a woman and then, after a chase, charged the officer with a knife, police said.

Police early Monday identified the suspect as Zander M. Clark, 20.

Police said they were called to the Home Depot near the Northway Mall in East Anchorage at 6:28 p.m. after a report of a domestic-violence-related stabbing.

"Initial indications are that a male and female were walking together in the Home Depot parking lot when they got into some type of verbal altercation," police said in a statement Saturday night. "The male pulled a knife and stabbed the female. The victim ran into Home Depot with a non-life-threatening injury."

Police said Zander slashed at least two tires of cars in the store's parking lot then fled. He was spotted in the parking lot of the Burger King nearby and ran toward the Penland Park mobile home park.

"The officer gave chase on foot," police wrote. "After entering the trailer park the suspect turned around, with knife in hand, and ran straight towards the officer. The officer fired; the suspect was declared deceased at the scene."

Police on Monday said no further details on the incident would be immediately available.
