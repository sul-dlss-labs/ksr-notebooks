PEKIN, Ill. (AP) -- A Tazewell County sheriff's deputy had no choice but to fatally shoot a Peoria man last month after the man stabbed and critically injured a 15-month old child, State's Attorney Stewart Umholtz said.

Authorities said Tim Gillespie Jr. shot and killed Chad Rains, 30, on Sept. 17 after he saw him holding a knife to Caitlen Jones' throat. The child is the daughter of Rains' girlfriend, Marci Jones.

Umholtz issued a five-page opinion Friday in which he said he determined that the shooting was justified, citing an investigation by the Illinois State Police.

``Through an independent review, Deputy Gillespie's use of deadly force was not only reasonable under the law but absolutely necessary,'' Umholtz said.

The incident occurred after deputies responded to a 911 hang-up call from a mobile home near Metamora.

Rains, who had been arguing with Marci Jones, was in a bedroom with the child when Gillespie entered and repeatedly asked him to release the child, according to police. Rains refused and was shot three times by Gillespie after he began cutting the child's neck, investigators said.

``Based on the facts, Deputy Gillespie made every effort to defuse this situation,'' Umholtz said.

The girl was treated and released from OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria the next day.

Gillespie underwent mandatory counseling after the shooting and returned to work after a one-week paid leave.
