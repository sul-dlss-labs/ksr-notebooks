PITTSBURGH (KDKA) -- A stolen vehicle suspect is dead following a short police chase that ended in a fiery crash at a church on Pittsburgh's North Side Friday night.

The crash happened around 9:50 p.m. at the intersection of Perrysville Avenue and West McIntyre Avenue in the Perry South neighborhood.

But officials say it all started a short time earlier at East Ohio Street and Middle Street.

"What we believe started this incident was a woman who got out of her vehicle on East Ohio Street, left it running and went to the ATM," said Sonya Toler, of the Pittsburgh Public Safety Department. "While she was occupied there, a man jumped in her car and sped off. There was a very brief chase, this was something less than a minute and he lost control here."

The stolen car careened out of control, cross the sidewalk and then slammed into the steps of the Christian Fellowship Missionary Baptist Church.

Toler said the car briefly caught fire.

The Allegheny County Medical Examiner's Office on Saturday identified the driver as Christian Davis. He died of blunt force trauma of the neck and trunk. The death has been ruled accidental.

Davis was rushed to Allegheny General Hospital where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at 10:26 p.m. Friday.

Crews had to close down Perrysville Avenue while then cleared the scene and investigated.

The extent of damage done to the church is not yet known.
