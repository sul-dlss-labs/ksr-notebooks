'Excited delirium' is ruled in death of man who struggled with police

A man who stopped breathing after he struggled with San Antonio police last month died after his cocaine intoxication developed into a controversial condition known as excited delirium, medical examiners have ruled.



Michael Olveda, 28, died May 7 after a scuffle with police, instigated when he refused to show them his identification and resisted their attempts to handcuff him.



A prolonged struggle ensued that left Olveda with a bloody nose, and after he was handcuffed, police noticed he wasn't breathing.



His autopsy, released Tuesday by the Bexar County district attorney's office, said Olveda had multiple abrasions on his face, arms and legs but they "alone were not life-threatening injuries."



Marks on his forearms were "consistent with handcuff restraint."





Olveda, the medical examiners wrote, died as a result of "cocaine intoxication causing Excited Delirium Syndrome."



Described as an overdose of adrenaline that's often exacerbated by drugs, the condition is characterized by sudden death after a physical struggle.



Although accepted by a growing number of medical examiners, excited delirium isn't recognized by the American Medical Association or listed in the chief psychiatric reference book.



Critics call it "junk science" that can obscure questionable police tactics.



Between 2001 and 2006, the Bexar County medical examiner's office ruled 25 people died of excited delirium ï¿½ 22 of those deaths occurred during or after the subject was restrained by police or medical personnel.



Kevin Stouwie, an attorney for relatives of Olveda, questioned whether Olveda would have died had it not been for the effects of his struggle with police.



"Perhaps if he just had cocaine in his system and no struggle with police, we wouldn't have a dead 28-year-old," he said.



Olveda was standing outside his brother's apartment when police arrived at 515 Riverside Drive, responding to a call about a man outside the Riverside Apartments complex who was "screaming at someone."



When the arriving officer asked Olveda for ID, he refused and began to act "belligerent" toward an officer who tried to handcuff him for safety reasons, according to a police report. Olveda began struggling with that officer as three other officers arrived to assist, the report said.



At least three witnesses to the encounter later told a reporter that the officers struck Olveda in the face while subduing him.



The officers realized after they had handcuffed Olveda that he had stopped breathing, the report said. A police spokeswoman said at the time that it appeared Police Department policy was followed.



But Stouwie questioned the reasons for the struggle.



"What justification did the police officers have to engage in this 20-minute struggle," he asked.



"There was no crime he was suspected to have committed."



Police spokesman Sgt. Gabe Trevino said the Police Department initiated a routine internal investigation into the officers' actions. He added that "it's no secret there was a physical confrontation between the suspect and several officers. When that happens, more than likely there are going to be physical injuries to the officers and the suspect."



Medical examiners recently ruled that excited delirium also killed another man who died during a struggle with San Antonio police in March. Police said Sergio Galvan, 35, attacked an officer who then squirted him with pepper spray before another officer stunned him three times with a Taser.



Galvan also was high on cocaine during the struggle, medical examiners said.
