Oklahoma City police have identified a man shot and killed by officers when he reportedly opened fire on them early Sunday morning.

The suspect, 21-year-old Daniel Laguna, was killed during an armed confrontation with police officers at an apartment complex in the 800 block of Brookwood Drive.

According to police, just after 12:30 a.m. Sunday, officers responded to a disturbance with gunshots fired. Sgt. Daniel Herring and Officer Nicholas Wallace arrived and found three men in front of one unit. One of the men was lying on the ground with obvious signs of being beaten.

Police said one suspect ran away. The other one, later identified as Laguna, was reportedly armed with a handgun and became involved in an armed confrontation with the officers. During the confrontation, Laguna was shot and killed by police.

Investigators later learned that the victim was inside the apartment with his wife when the two suspects broke in and began assaulting him. The reason for the attack is still under investigation.

Sgt. Herring and Officer Wallace were not injured during the confrontation. Both officers have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation.

Sgt. Herring is a 7-year veteran with the department, while Officer Wallace has been with the department for two years.

The second suspect who ran away has not been identified.

Laguna’s death was Oklahoma City’s 63rd homicide of 2016. Police said this is the fifth officer-involved shooting in 2016 in Oklahoma City.

Laguna had been booked into the Oklahoma County Jail nine times in the past on multiple complaints, including DUI, possession of drugs, suspended license, and more.
