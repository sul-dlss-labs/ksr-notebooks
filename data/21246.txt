A 23-year-old man who went to his ex-girlfriend's house to reconcile with her, but pulled a knife on her when she refused, was killed by Inkster Police when he attacked them.

"He was in a lot of trouble, she wanted him to straighten his life out,"

"I guess he had warrants."

The aunt said while the two were talking, he pulled out a knife and said he'll turn himself in to police. However, when police arrived, "he charged the cop with a knife."

One officer fired a shot at him, killing him.

Police are continuing to investigate the incident, but say the officer who shot the man was following procedure.
