CORONA (CBSLA.com) â€” Authorities say an off-duty police officer thwarted an attempted home invasion robbery on January 13 when he fatally shot one of three suspects.

Police say three men from the San Bernardino area attempted a home invasion robbery at a residence in the 1200 block of Kendrick Circle in Corona at approximately 8 p.m.

The off-duty officer, who is not a member of the Corona Police Department, was on-scene returning property to the homeowners. Officials say one of the three suspects confronted the officer in the driveway and one suspect was struck by gunfire.

Dushine James Smith, 41, was able to make it to a getaway car with the help of the other two suspects. Smith's gun was recovered at the scene.

Smith went to Kaiser Hospital in Fontana where he died from his wounds.

Corona Police Detectives -- along with San Bernardino Police -- launched an investigation to identify and locate the two remaining suspects.

Detectives obtained arrest warrants Friday for two suspects -- Adrian Tremain Coleman, 35, of San Bernardino and Quentinn Blair Macklin, 42, of Highland.

Coleman was arrested Friday in Ontario. Macklin was located in the city of Lancaster today. With the assistance of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's Lancaster Station, Macklin was taken into custody without incident.
