A man pursued since this morning by members of the U.S. Marshals' Gulf Coast Regional Fugitive Task Force took his own life tonight on U.S. 280, according to U.S. Marshal C. Martin Keely.

The 33-year-old man, whose name is not being released until his family is notified, was wanted on multiple burglary, theft and drug charges, and several violations of the terms of his probation from past convictions, Keely said.

"In the property crimes in the past, he did have a history of violence," Keely said.Task force members saw the man run into the woods near the Cahaba Cove apartments on U.S. 280 at about 11:30 this morning. This evening, the man got into the passenger side of a woman's car.

The car was stopped by task force members near the Grandview Parkway intersection. The man then shot and killed himself.

"She was not seriously injured," Keely said of the driver. "She was obviously shaken from seeing this man take his own life in front of her," Keely said.

The incident happened around 8:30 p.m.

The Hoover and Birmingham police departments, marshals and other law enforcement officials briefly closed off part of U.S. 280 West near the Interstate 459 interchange.

Keely said some law enforcement officials remain on the scene with the Jefferson County coroner's office.
