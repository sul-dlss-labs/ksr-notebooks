CUBA, N.M. (AP) â€” New Mexico police say the driver of a car that reached speeds up to 130 mph (209 kph) while fleeing from a state trooper has died of his injuries after crashing into a church.

They have identified the driver as 20-year-old Christopher Cloud of Ignacio, Colorado.

The incident began early Thursday just north of the village of Cuba when the trooper clocked the car speeding on U.S. 550.

New Mexico State Police say the trooper chased the car for more than a mile, but decided to break off the pursuit because of safety concerns.

The vehicle apparently had hit a curb before smashing through the front of the church.

The trooper saw smoke, drove to the scene, put out a fire in the crashed vehicle and attempted life-saving procedures.
