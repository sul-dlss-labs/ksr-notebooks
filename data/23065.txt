Bartlett police still have not released the name of the man who stormed into Applebee's restaurant on Bartlett Boulevard with a gun yesterday.

Officers say he forced a woman outside with him.

She was not hurt, but he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound outside the restaurant.

Police say the confrontation was part of a domestic dispute.

"They exited the Applebees. The investigation is still pending, but we do know that the male victim died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound," says Lt. Jeff Cox of the Bartlett Police Department.

Police say the gunman went into the restaurant and came out with a woman.

Witnesses told us that the woman is a manager at the restaurant. We're also told that the gunman was her boyfriend, and an empolyee of Applebee's.

"We were grabbing them and knew something was wrong, started grabbing them and then we heard shots fired," says witness, Jill Davidson.

Davidson says there was chaos as people looked for a safe haven.

Then she heard gunfire.

"You could hear it through the whole parking lot," says Davidson.

Wanda Kirkman's granddaughter was working inside at the time, and called Kirkman, hysterical, as it all unfolded.

"She was just saying why did he do it, why did he do it. I was just thinking thank God he didn't do a random shooting and just start shooting everyone inside the restaurant," says Kirkman

Investigators said they don't know exactly what happened inside the restaurant.

They have confirmed that no shots were fired inside.

Police have not released any information about the victim.
