LOS ANGELES – A motorist wanted by authorities shot and killed himself Wednesday when he was stopped by sheriff’s deputies following a brief chase in the Exposition Park area.

Ronnie Lamont Robinson, 39, of Los Angeles died at the scene of the shooting, which occurred about 7:10 a.m. in the 1500 block of West Exposition Boulevard, according to sheriff’s Sgt. Diane Hecht and the coroner’s office.

“Detectives have learned that when deputies attempted to make a traffic stop on a vehicle, the driver accelerated, and then pulled to the curb,” Hecht said.

“Initially, the suspect was cooperative and put his hands out of the driver’s window, then suddenly withdrew his hands back into the car and shot himself.”

The man “was wanted in connection with an investigation by Operation Safe Streets Bureau personnel,” Hecht said.
