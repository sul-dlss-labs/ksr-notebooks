CAMDEN — New Jersey authorities have identified the armed man who was fatally shot outside a Camden home this weekend by state troopers and city police.

But what sparked the events that led to the death of 23-year-old Jeffrey Thomas of Camden remained unclear this afternoon..

Several law enforcement officers responded to the home around 1:30 a.m. Saturday, after a resident there reported that Thomas was waving a handgun around outside the residence.

A short time later, officials say multiple shots were fired by multiple officers and troopers. Thomas was pronounced dead at the scene, and the gun he had been waving was recovered.

The state Attorney General’s office is heading the investigation, which is standard procedure when a state trooper is involved in a shooting.
