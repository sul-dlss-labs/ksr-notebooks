Mission Police Release Details of Fatal Officer Involved Shooting

MISSION – It’s an emotional day for law enforcement, not just in Mission, but across the Rio Grande Valley.

Police chiefs, sheriffs, constables, state troopers were offering support for the Mission Police Department.

Cpl. Jose “Speedy” Espericueta, a 13-year veteran of the police force, was killed in the line of duty Thursday night.

The Mission police chief fought back tears as he recalled last night’s events and the life of the corporal officer.

Espericueta leaves behind his wife and two children.

He was shot by Juan Carlos Chapa, Jr., a 33-year-old with a lengthy criminal record, according to Chief Robert Dominguez.

"Corporal Espericueta was able to fire back and the other officers who had already arrived on scene as well fired back at him as well and he was struck multiple times,” stated Dominguez.

Chapa died at the hospital.

Dominguez says he wished they had the luxury of pairing all officers on patrol.

He explained random patrols depend on the number of officers patrolling and if they’re in-training.

The police chief says he and Espericueta’s family will be working on funeral arrangements.

The Texas Rangers are investigating the officer involved shooting.
