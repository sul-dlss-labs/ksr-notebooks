PATERSON â€” Prosecutors say a Passaic County police officer shot and killed an armed man this weekend.

The Record of Woodland Park reports two Paterson officers were on patrol early Sunday when they saw Jacobe Hyatt with a handgun. When the 38-year-old city resident failed to comply with their directive to drop his weapon, one of the officers fired a shot that hit Hyatt in the abdomen.

He died a short time later at a hospital.

The officers' names were not immediately disclosed. They were not injured in the confrontation, though the officer who fired the shot was taken to a hospital for observation.

The shooting will be reviewed by the Passaic County Prosecutor's Office, which is standard policy in police-involved shootings.
