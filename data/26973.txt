SEATTLE (AP) — A man fatally shot by a Snohomish County sheriff’s deputy has been identified as a 44-year-old Everett man.

The county medical examiner’s office released Ryan D. Hemmingson’s name Tuesday.

The Seattle Times reports Hemmingson was shot by a deputy in South Everett around 8 p.m. Saturday.

The Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team says deputies had been called to an apartment complex there after receiving a report that Hemmingson was suicidal and had harmed himself with a knife.

The multi-agency team says Hemmingson “began to advance” on deputies when they arrived. One deputy deployed a less-lethal pepper ball gun before another officer shot Hemmingson.

Hemmingson died at an Everett hospital.

The agency says a knife was recovered from the scene but it wasn’t clear if Hemmingson was holding the knife at the time of the shooting.

The officers have been put on leave while the shooting is investigated.
