A six-year-old child was fatally shot by their three-year-old sibling Monday in Alabama, according to police and local reports.

The incident happened in Shelby County, according to police. Investigators determined the three-year-old child found the firearm inside the home and accidentally shot a six-year-old around 10:00 a.m., according to police. Police said the incident unfolded at the home of a Helena police officer but that the officer wasn’t home at the time of the accident, according to WBRC 6.

“There was nothing that indicates that his duty weapon or any of his issued equipment was involved in this tragedy,” Helena Police Chief Major Clay Hammac said, according to WVTM 13. “This was a personal firearm that was left unsecured in the home.”
