PRESS RELEASE FROM HARRISON COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE

On Jan. 6, (Monday), at approximately 2 p.m., the Clarksburg Police Department received a call involving two females being followed and harassed near the downtown Clarksburg Post Office. While trying to identify the suspect, Shon A Spencer, a 49-year-old male, of Nutter Fort, fled from the officer in his vehicle, a white Ford F150 pickup truck.

The Clarksburg Police Officer pursued the suspect from Clarksburg, to Wilsonburg, on U.S. Route 50 where the suspect turned around and headed back towards Clarksburg on U.S. Route 50. Near the Joyce Street intersection Harrison County Deputy Sheriff’s became involved in the pursuit.

Shortly thereafter both agencies terminated the pursuit, due to weather/roadway conditions, until Deputies observed the suspect attempt to ram civilian vehicles at which time the deputies reinitiated the pursuit. The suspect turned off U.S. Route 50 onto Interstate 79 south bound. The pursuit continued on I-79 until it reached the Anmoore exit where the suspect rammed multiple Sheriff’s Department cruisers, which caused the suspect’s vehicle to spin out and come to a stop.

Deputies then boxed the suspect vehicle in and approached on foot. The suspect was ordered to stop and exit his vehicle multiple times by Deputies. The suspect ignored these commands, shaking his head “no.” The suspect then accelerated his vehicle ramming a stopped police cruiser, pushing it approximately 15 feet, and struck a Deputy Sheriff, with his vehicle, knocking him to the ground.

At which point deputies commenced discharging their weapons at the suspect ending the pursuit and fatally wounding the suspect.
