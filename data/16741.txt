Following a fatal stabbing just outside West Palm Beach, a Palm Beach County Sheriff’s deputy shot and killed a man carrying a machete, authorities said.

The Sheriff’s Office identified the man fatally stabbed as Mauro Londono, 60. The man shot by the deputy was identified as Amado Lago, 46.

The events unfolded shortly after 8 p.m. Wednesday when deputies were answering a call about an assault along the 600 block of Mercury Street, according to Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.

The area is south of Gun Club Road and west of Kirk Road.

A neighbor told Sun Sentinel news partner WPEC-Ch. 12 that the fight stemmed from an argument between neighbors about dog feces.

According to Bradshaw, two deputies arriving at the scene first saw Londono on the ground in a driveway in a pool of blood. About 25 feet away, he said a second man, later identified as Lago, was pacing up and down in the driveway with a machete in his hand.

While one of the deputies was retrieving a stun gun in order to subdue Lago, the other repeatedly told him to put the knife down.

“He turned, raised the knife and charged towards the deputy who was standing over the gentleman on the ground, protecting him to see if he was still alive,” Bradshaw said.

That’s when the deputy fired at the machete-wielding man. Lago died on the scene.

Additionally, Bradshaw said, a woman who suffered stab wounds, Claudia Morales, 54, was taken to a hospital, where she underwent surgery. She was expected to survive.

No deputies were hurt during the incident. Both deputies at the scene were placed on paid administrative leave.
