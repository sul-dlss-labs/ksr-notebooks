happy 50th old man. half a century is quite a number. my daughter was just born on the 31st and i’m making so many strides i thought were impossible for me. i know my life would be so much different if you were here, and understanding that you’re gone is still a pill i haven’t quite swallowed. nonetheless, i’ve come to terms with the past enough to manage and move forward. i’ll always have a place in my heart for you dad. i think about you more often than i’d like to admit and it will take more time for me to fully overcome your loss. i love you. i’ll always love and miss you. i thought things would get easier as i got older but they didn’t, i just got more prepared. anyways, im rambling because every time i come here, i see your face and remember everything. all of the cute cheesy moments we had playing with toys, and watching rescue hero’s. i remember it all pops. i love you, and happy 50th.
