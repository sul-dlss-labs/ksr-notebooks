Authorities have released the name of a gunman shot and killed by a Newark police officer early this morning after a foot chase in the city's South Ward.

The 1:15 a.m. incident was triggered by reports of gunfire on Ludlow Street. When officers arrived, they found a group of 10 to 15 men hanging out, authorities said.

The men scattered, and the officers chased after them, cornering several of them at Ludlow and Virginia streets, police said. One suspect, 21-year-old Jihaad Sumler, pulled a gun and pointed it at one of the officers, police said.

An officer whom police did not identify fired at Sumler, hitting him twice in the torso, according to the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. He was taken to University Hospital, were he was declared dead.

Investigators found a loaded handgun near where Sumler collapsed, prosecutor's office spokesman Paul Loriquet said. Authorities believe it was the weapon Sumler pointed at the officers.

Two officers, including the one who shot Sumler, was taken to University Hospital for observation, authorities said. They will undergo routine counseling and evaluation.

Authorities said they are still trying to piece together the events that led to the shooting.

Sumler's family, who live in the neighborhood, could not be reached for comment.

Police have not arrested anyone in connection to the original reports of gunfire, police said. Two people at the scene were arrested for outstanding warrants.
