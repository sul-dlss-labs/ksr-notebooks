Carlos Edwin Arevalo, 22, a Latino man, was killed in an officer-involved shooting at 3411 Loosmore St. in Cypress Park about 6: 25 p.m. Friday, Feb. 29.

Police said the shooting occurred when Officers Mario Gallegos, Joshua Kniss and Jason Schwab from LAPD's Metropolitan Division were patrolling the area in an unmarked vehicle. As officers approached Pleasant View Street they saw two men, Carlos Edwin Arevalo, 22, and Moises Mora, standing behind a parked vehicle.

Arevalo ran from the officers after they stopped near the two men to investigate. Schwab chased after Arevalo on foot to the rear side of the residence where the officer-involved shooting occurred.

Arevalo was shot in the left side of the upper back and right hip. He was taken to County-USC hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. A .45-caliber pistol was recovered at the scene, police said.
