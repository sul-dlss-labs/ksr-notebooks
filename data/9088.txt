A man fatally shot by Commerce City police early Thursday had been wanted in Boulder County for walking away from a halfway house last fall.

Phillip Michael Boldin, 42, rammed his vehicle into a patrol car shortly after midnight at a mobile home park in the 6900 block of Colo. 2, according to Commerce City police.

After receiving a tip on Boldin’s whereabouts, officers had set up surveillance around his home and confronted him when he tried to leave, police said. An officer opened fire when Boldin crashed his car into a patrol car, police spokesman Christian Rasmussen said.

A female passenger was also wounded by police fire, but is expected to be released from the hospital today.

The officer whose car was hit was treated at the scene for minor injuries.

Boldin has an extensive criminal history that includes convictions for an attempted escape in 2004 in Larimer County and vehicular eluding and second-degree burglary in Boulder County, said Colorado Department of Corrections spokeswoman Katherine Sanguinetti.

She said the warrant for Boldin’s arrest was issued by her department on Sept. 12, 2009, after he walked away from the Boulder Community Treatment Center, where he was serving a community corrections sentence.

Rasmussen said Boldin’s last known address was at the Commerce City trailer park.

He would not identify the name of Boldin’s passenger, and said he didn’t know whether she would face any charges.

The Adams County Critical Incident Team is handling the investigation, Rasmussen said.
