A 45-year-old Belleville man was sentenced Monday to 13.5 to 30 years in prison for the death of a motorcyclist that occurred during a police chase in Canton Township over the summer.

William Floyd Craner pleaded no contest to a second-degree murder charge in the July 15 death of 46-year-old Anthony Salvatore Quasarano of Romulus.

Craner was originally charged with second-degree murder, first-degree fleeing and eluding, manslaughter with a motor vehicle and felony with a motor vehicle.

Police said the chase began after a woman called the night of July 15 to report she was following a driver who struck her car and fled the scene.

Officers attempted to stop Craner's car, but he sped up and struck Quasarano's motorcycle, police said.
