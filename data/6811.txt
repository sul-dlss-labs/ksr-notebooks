Plainclothes cops shot and killed an armed ex-con after a confrontation on a Queens street early Saturday, police said.

The three cops were in an unmarked car when they spotted reputed gang member Ronnie Smalls, 22, and another man walking along Beach Channel Drive in Far Rockaway at 1:40 a.m., police said.

They had recognized Smalls from an incident Nov. 23 when he ran from cops after tossing a loaded .40-caliber handgun, a police source said.

Two officers stepped out of the vehicle while the third followed in the car, the source said. The cops on foot asked the two men to stop, but Smalls turned and ran, the source said.

One cop gave chase on foot while the officer in the car followed with lights on - and saw Smalls reach into his back waistband and pull out a gun as he turned onto Beach 63rd St., the source said.

Smalls collided with the cop chasing on foot, and as they wrestled on the ground, several shots went off, the source said.

"I was in bed and heard three shots," said Mofolorunsho Oladipo, 46, who lives nearby. "A minute or so later, there were lights and sirens."

Smalls was hit at least twice - once in the head and once in the leg. He was pronounced dead at Peninsula Hospital.

A .380-caliber Baretta - reported stolen from South Portland, Maine, on Nov. 26 - was found loaded and cocked at the scene. It was not immediately clear if it had been fired, the source said.

The 23-year-old officer who chased Smalls fired four rounds from his weapon, the source said. He's a three-year veteran and had never before fired his weapon.

Smalls was a suspected member of GIB or Get It in Brick, a Bloods faction that deals in cocaine, heroin and marijuana, sources said. He had 10 prior arrests, including charges for attempted murder, assault and gun possession, officials said.

Smalls was the second man shot and killed by police during the first week of 2008.
