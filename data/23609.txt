Primitivo Macias-Rodriguez, a 46-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Monday, Jan. 8, in the 200 block of East Florence Avenue in Florence, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Shortly after 6 p.m., Metropolitan Division officers in an unmarked police car began following Macias-Rodriguez, who they said was driving erratically, according to LAPD Det. Meghan Aguilar.

The driver crashed into two cars and a light pole, police said. Aguilar said she did not know if officers had initiated a traffic stop.

Days after the shooting, Chief Charlie Beck said that Macias-Rodriguez pulled out a gun, "pushed his upper body out of the vehicle," and pointed the gun at the officers, prompting police to shoot.

Macias-Rodriguez was pronounced dead at the scene at 6:16 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

A firearm, later described as an assault weapon, was recovered near the vehicle, according to police.

The occupants of the two other vehicles involved in the crash sustained minor injuries that did not require hospitalization. The officers were not injured.

LAPD’s Force Investigation Division was interviewing witnesses and officers late Monday.
