CACHE COUNTY, Utah - A man was shot and killed in Logan Canyon Monday morning by a Cache County Sheriff's deputy.

The shooting took place around 10:20 a.m. in the area of Right Hand Fork.

Logan Police identified the man as 30-year-old Jeremy Ray Swenson of Hyrum, Utah.

Deputies were responding to a call about a man making suicidal threats. When they arrived they realized a second person was also involved.

"The individual was making threatening actions with a weapon toward another individual," said Lt. Mike Peterson with the Cache County Sheriff's Office.

A sheriff's deputy tried to get the suspect to stop.

"The suspect did not respond to commands to drop the weapon, the suspect then made a threatening motion with the weapon requiring the deputy to fire a single shot wounding the suspect," said Peterson.

The person being threatened didn't suffer any injuries. As for the suspect, he was in need of medical attention. Deputies tried to save his life.

"Deputies on scene rendered first aid to the suspect, the suspect was transported to Logan Regional Hospital via ambulance where he was pronounced dead," Peterson said.

The sheriff's office did not say the relationship between the suspect and the other person involved.

"At this time we are not releasing any of the names of the individuals involved," Peterson said.

It's standard protocol for an outside police agency to come in and take over an investigation if there is an officer involved shooting. In this case Logan City Police is now the lead agency in the investigation.
