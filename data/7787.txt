NORTHAMPTON - A preliminary autopsy on a Colrain man shows that the bullet that killed him was from a police officer's gun.



An autopsy has determined that Ronald E. Wood III died from "multiple abdominal injuries due to a gunshot wound," according to a prepared statement Friday from Northwestern District Attorney Elizabeth D. Schiebel.



"Preliminary ballistics results suggest that Mr. Wood was struck by two firearms. His lethal wound appears to have been caused by officer fire," the statement says.



Deputy First Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Dunphy Farris said Friday that the investigation is continuing.



The officer has not been identified. She does not know the status of the officer and referred questions to state police.



Wood was transported by helicopter to Baystate Medical Center in Springfield on Jan. 12 after he was shot during a standoff with police at his home. Authorities said that Wood had also been shot before police arrived.



In addition, a search warrant was executed at Wood's home at 457 Main Road and investigators recovered 15 firearms and various ammunition, according to the district attorney's statement.



"A report of the details of this investigation will be available when all ballistics testing is completed and final autopsy results are available," the statement reads.
