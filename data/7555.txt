The victims of the fatal crash Sat., Oct. 11, on Miller Lane in Butler Twp. have been identified as two Daytonians.



The Montgomery County coroner's office said Sunday that 22-year-old Lanisha Brookins and 28-year-old James Reed III, both of Dayton, died from injuries suffered in the crash.



Butler Twp. police said Saturday that the 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix driven by Reed fled from a traffic stop, then Reed lost control and went airborne. The car landed on the concrete base of the Olive Garden restaurant sign in the 6700 block of Miller Lane.



Butler Twp. police Chief Danny Hobbs said Saturday the crash was not the result of a pursuit, saying the crash happened before the police officer caught up to the Pontiac.



Hobbs said officers did find a loaded handgun in the car and a small amount of marijuana.
