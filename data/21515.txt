Lexington police are investigating a crash involving a police cruiser that left a pedestrian dead.

The Fayette County Coroner's Office confirmed to WKYT that 50-year-old Dave Miles died at 2:56 Wednesday morning at UK Medical Center Emergency Department.

Ginny Ramsey, with the Catholic Action Center, confirm to WKYT that Miles was homeless. Ramsey said he would sleep on the streets some nights or stay at the Hope Center.

The crash happened around 2:30 Wednesday morning on Euclid Avenue near Woodland Avenue.

Emergency crews took Miles to the hospital with critical injuries; he later died.

Stephen Hadley, who lives near the intersection, said he saw police searching nearby yards during the investigation.

"I saw a couple of articles of clothing in the street; what looks to be maybe a shirt and a single shoe in the middle of the road there,"

Hadley described.

The Lexington Police Department said the policeman was responding to a request from another officer for assistance on a traffic stop at the time of the crash. On Wednesday morning, police said the officer did not have his lights and sirens activated. The department did say that the officer had his body-worn camera activated, but did not clarify it that was before or after the collision. Investigators have also not commented on whether Miles was in a crosswalk; the crash did happen near an intersection.

The police department's Critical Response Unit was activated to investigate the crash. The departmentâ€™s Public Integrity Unit will also conduct an internal review.

The department has reassigned the officer while the investigation continues.
