LILLINGTON, N.C. â€” One person was airlifted to a hospital Tuesday night after leading authorities on a vehicle pursuit and crashing near Lillington.

Jeffrey George, 21, fled from police to avoid arrest after a drug sale to an undercover officer, Lillington Town Manager Bill Summers said.

The pursuit started on South River Road, and George crashed on U.S. Highway 421 near Mamers Road, authorities said.

There was no word on George's condition.
