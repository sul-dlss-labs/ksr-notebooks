SOUTH RIVER â€“ A borough man shot during a confrontation with police died Sunday, according to the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office.

Kevin F. McGlyn, 51, a resident of the Village Green apartment complex in South River, was pronounced dead at 4:42 p.m. at Robert Wood Johnson University Medical Center, prosecutor Bruce Kaplan's office said in a news release.

Two borough police officers responded early Saturday morning to a report that McGlyn had threatened two men in the parking lot of the apartment complex. When they arrived, he "confronted" them with a knife, and one of the officers shot him, Kaplan's office said.

Following state guidelines, the prosecutor's office took control of the investigation after the shooting, and also notified the state attorney general.

The prosecutor's office is withholding the identity of the two borough police officers involved in the shooting. They were uninjured.

An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.
