NEW PORT RICHEY — Officers shot and killed a man early Tuesday afternoon while responding to a reported disturbance at a downtown bar, New Port Richey Police Chief Kim Bogart said.

Details of the shooting were scarce Tuesday and Bogart said the man killed had not yet been identified. The chief did not name the two officers involved in the shooting but said they had been placed on administrative leave, a standard process when law enforcement officers use deadly force.

At about 12:10 p.m., Bogart said, two officers responded to Sullivan’s Boulevard Lounge at 6212 Grand Boulevard after a caller reported that someone inside was causing a disturbance. When the officers entered, Bogart said, a man inside the bar produced a gun and pointed it at them.

The officers fired at the man, killing him, Bogart said. He declined to say whether the man fired any shots.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the State Attorney’s Office was asked to investigate the shooting, Bogart said. The Pasco County Sheriff’s Office provided crime scene technicians. The New Port Richey Police Department will not conduct its own investigation.

Agents with the state Department of Law Enforcement were at the scene of the shooting Tuesday afternoon, a spokeswoman said.

Neither officer was wearing a body camera, Bogart said. City officials in September approved spending more than $264,000 to purchase 40 body cameras and 13 cameras for police cars, but the equipment has not yet arrived, he said.

Bogart did not know whether the incident had been recorded by security cameras or other devices.
