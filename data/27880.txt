JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (KMIZ)

The Cole County prosecuting attorney said Wednesday that he will not file charges against a Jefferson City police officer who fatally shot a suspect last month.

Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson said in a statement that his review of the Missouri State Highway Patrol's investigation showed the officer acted appropriately and lawfully when shooting Anthony J. Wilson. The statement said Thompson's office would have no further comment.

Wilson was killed after a police chase late April 15. Police said Wilson and another man, Jamie T. Williams, were in a car with Florida plates that matched a car seen in connection with other shootings.

Wilson and Williams jumped out of the moving vehicle and ran, authorities say. Thompson's statement said Wilson pulled a handgun and shot twice during the foot chase, hitting a Jefferson City police officer in the chest. Another officer shot Wilson, who was pronounced dead at the scene, the statement said.

The officer who was shot was wearing a bulletproof vest.

Police later found Williams with help from a highway patrol helicopter.

Jamie Williams

Williams was charged with second-degree murder, felony resisting arrest, driving without a license and misdemeanor marijuana possession. He is being held without bond.
