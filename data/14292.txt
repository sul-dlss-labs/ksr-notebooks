A woman who died early Thursday morning after being struck by an unmarked sheriff’s office vehicle on Dual Highway was identified Saturday as Lindsay C. Eldessoky of Hagerstown, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said.

Eldessoky, 28, was struck at about 3:30 a.m. by an unmarked sheriff’s office vehicle that was traveling east in the 1300 block of Dual Highway, the sheriff’s office said.

The driver of the vehicle, Deputy 1st Class Bryan Teets, was on duty when the accident occurred and since has been placed on paid administrative leave, Sheriff Douglas W. Mullendore has said.

Deputies rendered first aid and took Eldessoky to Meritus Medical Center near Hagerstown, where she was pronounced dead at about 5:30 a.m., the sheriff’s office has said.

The Maryland State Police accident reconstruction team is expected to assist deputies with the investigation, Mullendore has said.

The investigation is to be reviewed by another agency and the Washington County State’s Attorney’s Office, Mullendore has said.

The eastbound lanes of Dual Highway reopened just after 9 a.m. after being closed for several hours between Eastern Boulevard and Mount Aetna Road.

The deputy sheriff’s vehicle was towed from the scene.

The incident marked the second time in less than three weeks that a pedestrian has died after being struck by a vehicle on Dual Highway.

Lisa Ruth Wellham, 58, of Cumberland, Md., was struck by a hit-and-run vehicle on March 18.

Wellham was found in the median in the 900 block of Dual Highway, police have said.

She died at Meritus Medical Center shortly after the accident.

Hagerstown Police Chief Mark Holtzman said Thursday morning that the driver of the hit-and-run vehicle in the March 18 incident has not yet been found.
