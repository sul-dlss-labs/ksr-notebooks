SANTA ANA – A 32-year-old man has died from his injuries after being shot by police on Aug. 1 in a struggle outside the Orange County Superior Court building in downtown, police said Wednesday.

Richard Gene Swihart, a local transient, was near the Plaza of the Flags at about 9:30 a.m. when approached by two Santa Ana officers from the Civic Center Patrol Unit. Witnesses said he had no shirt on and was riding a bicycle when stopped.

Santa Ana police has said Swihart became hostile and got into a physical altercation with one of the officers. Swihart tried to grab the officer’s gun, prompting the officer’s partner to fire multiple rounds, striking Swihart in the upper torso, police have said.

Swihart was taken to Orange County Global Medical Center in Santa Ana where he remain in critical condition until he died on Aug. 14, police Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said Wednesday.

Swihart was a regular in the area frequented by homeless people.

Longtime friend Gabriel Lopez, 29, remembered Swihart, a father of two, as an upbeat “comedian” always cracking jokes.

Swihart grew up in foster homes and had lived at the Orangewood Children’s Home in Orange, Lopez said. A brother and his father died in recent years.

Lopez said Swihart had been financially stable but turned to drugs after his brother’s death, eventually becoming homeless: “The drugs just took over.”

The Orange County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the incident, as it does with all officer-involved shootings.

There has been growing concern over the number of homeless people in the the downtown Civic Center. Local homeless advocates estimate the number has grown by about 100 people to 500 during the past year.
