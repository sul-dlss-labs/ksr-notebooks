MIDDLEBURG HEIGHTS, Ohio -- A Middleburg Heights man died late Monday after struggling with Middleburg Heights officers who used a Taser to subdue him.

The Cuyahoga County medical examiner's office did an autopsy Tuesday on 41-year-old Howard Hammon but have not yet determined what caused his death, a spokesman said.

Police Chief John Maddox said officers responded shortly after 11 p.m. to a call that a woman's car was rear-ended while waiting at the intersection of Fowles and Pearl roads.

After talking with the driver who caused the accident, officers suspected he was drinking or on drugs, Maddox said.

Maddox said today that police learned that the victim actually lives on Bagley Road in Middleburg Heights, though his driver's license lists an older Westlake address.

Here is how Maddox said the arrest unfolded:

Hammon resisted efforts to handcuff him, and officers took him to the ground. The man, more than 6 feet tall and 275 pounds, continued to struggle with officers after they warned him that he would be shocked if he did not stop.

The first time he was shocked he was unfazed. After the second time, officers were able to link two sets of handcuffs on him and he stayed on the ground.

Maddox said medical personnel examine any person who has a physical confrontation with police, so officers had already called for an ambulance when they noticed Hammon was not breathing.

He was taken to the hospital where he was confirmed dead.

Maddox said that much of the arrest, except for the end, was caught on police dash camera.

"From what I can tell officers followed our policies," Maddox said.
