BEECHER, Ill. (WBBM) -- Beecher man shot by Will County Sheriff's police Friday outside his trailer home has died.

It all started around 9:30 a.m. when a woman who says she's renting a room to the suspect called police, fearing for her safety. She said 69-year-old Ed Jermolowicz had been drinking for several days and was now threatening to kill himself and her, Newsradio 780's Michele Fiore reports.

The woman was able to escape from the home at 3 Bobwhite Lane in Beecher. Will county sheriff's police say a half-hour later, Jermolowicz walked out the front door and pointed a loaded .38-calibre revolver in their direction.

Police fired a single shot, killing him.
