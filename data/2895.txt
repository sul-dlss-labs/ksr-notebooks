An East Texas man is shot in the head while allegedly trying to grab an officer's gun. At 10:00 a.m.,Gregg County warrant deputy, Mark Polk, accompanied by probation officer Melinda Hieber, went to a residence located in the 4000 block of FM 2087 near Kilgore in an attempt to arrest a subject for violation of probation.

The officers had a Gregg County arrest warrant for Roger Lee Crossland. As deputy Polk attempted to arrest Crossland, the 19-year-old struggled with the officer to gain control of the officers gun.

Two shots were fired and Crossland received a gunshot wound to the head. He was transported to a Longview hospital where he is listed in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

"In this case apparently the defendant failed to comply and did not want to go to jail peacefully" said Gregg County Sheriff Maxey Cerliano. People in the quiet neighborhood were a little unnerved at the news of a shooting.

"Kind of scary, nothing like that's ever happened out here before" said longtime resident Dorothy Thompson.

Crossland is expected to be charged with assault of a public servant. Texas Rangers are investigating the incident.
