Beloit police officers were justified in shooting and killing a 23-year-old man on June 11, because he posed a lethal threat to officers and others in the area, the Rock County District Attorney has ruled.

David O'Leary said by news release on Wednesday that the officers acted lawfully in shooting Darrius Lowery Baptiste during a traffic stop in downtown Beloit.

"He was shot and killed by the officers involved, as a direct result of his own actions," O'Leary said in the release.

Sgt. Dan Tilley and officers Brian Miller and Seth Hendricks tried to take Baptiste into custody on East Grand Avenue on June 11 during a traffic stop on an outstanding warrant from the Department of Corrections.

He also was sought in connection with a shooting in Beloit where his cellphone was found near the shooting site.

Baptiste refused orders to get out of the car, and bumped Tilley's squad car trying to drive away, turning his car right at Tilley.

"The officers feared for Sgt. Tilley's safety, and believed there was an imminent threat to Sgt. Tilley and other citizens in the area," O'Leary said in the news release. "Due to this threat, officers fired multiple times at Baptiste, and he died at the scene."

A semi-automatic handgun was found in Baptiste's car.

"The use of force by the officers was both legal and appropriate under the facts presented by the independent investigation conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation," O'Leary said.
