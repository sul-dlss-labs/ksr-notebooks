MAHWAH â€” A 25-year-old man who died while in police custody Sunday night appeared to be under the influence of drugs, authorities said.

Mahwah Chief James N. Batelli said that officers were called to a Campgaw Road home at around 10:16 p.m. Sunday by a resident who said his son was behaving erratically. When they arrived, they found the son, later identified as Michael Garbowski, locked in a bathroom.

Officers heard Garbowski kicking and punching the walls inside, Batelli said, and refused several commands to come out of the bathroom. Eventually, the door was forced in by Garbowski's father.

Garbowski still refused to leave the bathroom, and mumbled speech that was "indiscernible", Batelli said.

Officers eventually forced him out, handcuffed him and placed him on the floor as they waited for ambulances to arrive.

While they waited, Garbowski stopped breathing, Batelli said. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Batelli said police also found drugs inside Garbowski's home.

The incident is being investigated by the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office, according to policy involving all deaths in police custody.
