WARREN, Pa. — Details have emerged regarding an officer-involved shooting death Friday night just outside the city of Warren, Pa.

Warren-based State Police said 54-year-old Joseph Miller of Clarendon, Pa., was shot and killed around 7:30 p.m. following a traffic stop at Dairy Delite, an ice cream and frozen yogurt stand, on Route 6 in Mead Township outside the city.

The incident began after police in the city of Warren were contacted regarding a maroon Jeep reportedly driving erratically. A city officer located the Jeep, driven by Miller, and followed the vehicle across the Glade Bridge and into the parking lot of the ice cream stand.

The officer, who has not been identified, approached the Jeep at which time Miller reportedly became agitated. State police said Miller began loading an AK-47 rifle he had with him in the vehicle.

The officer backed away from the Jeep while issuing verbal commands. Miller reportedly ignored the commands and continued to load the weapon before exiting the vehicle.

The city officer fired his weapon, striking and killing Miller. No one else was injured in the shooting.

Pennsylvania State Police said the investigation is ongoing. Police are being assisted by the Warren City Police Department, Warren County Sheriff’s Office and Warren County District Attorney’s Office.

Rob Greene, Warren County district attorney, said late Friday the shooting appeared to be justified.
