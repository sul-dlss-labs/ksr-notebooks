HUNTSVILLE, Ala. — Huntsville Police Department is investigating a late night officer-involved shooting.

Police say they then found the suspect, Haraesheo Rice, 31 near Green Meadow Road, still armed.

HPD says officers told Rice to drop the gun, but he instead pointed it at officers and waved it in the air. Officers fired at the suspect, killing him.

While approaching Rice, another body was found dead on the scene with gunshot wounds, police say.

The person found dead at the scene has been identified by the Madison County Coroner’s Office as Keith Ricks, 47.
