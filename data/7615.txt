Alejandro Erazo, a 25-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a Culver City police officer shortly before 9 p.m. Sunday, Nov. 8, 2008.

Culver City police officers had spotted Erazo in a vehicle matching the description of one mentioned in a report about an assault with a deadly weapon, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department records.

Officers who responded to the call said they saw three Latino men getting into a car, sheriff's officials said.

The three men, including Erazo, and the car matched the suspect and vehicle descriptions in the call the officers received. Several officers arrived, and they stopped the vehicle.

Erazo got out of the passenger side of the car and was shot after he refused to comply with officers' orders, according to Sheriff's Department investigators. Authorities said they recovered a gun at the scene.
