Crime & Safety Update: Officer Shot, Killed Robbery Suspect As Man Attacked Him Police: John Schneider gashed officer's head with a blunt object that turned out to be "airsoft" gun. Reply

Gwinnett Police say a robbery suspect was shot and killed as he reportedly attacked a police officer Monday morning.

John Schneider, 24, of Lawrenceville died at the scene near Bethesda Methodist Church, a couple of blocks away from a Wells Fargo bank branch he allegedly robbed. The officer was treated and released at Gwinnett Medical Center with a gash to his head. Police say Schneider attacked the officer with an “airsoft” gun he may have used in the robbery.

Police received a call around 9 a.m. of a bank robbery at the Wells Fargo bank at 3065 Lawrenceville Highway in unincorporated Lawrenceville. Witnesses told police the armed man was last seen running across Lawrenceville Highway toward Bethesda Church Road. A person matching the description was located behind the church. The officer asked the man to show his hands, but he charged the officer and “struck the officer in the head with a blunt object,” a news release stated.

“The officer fell to the ground as the suspect continued to hit him with this object,” Gwinnett Cpl. Ed Ritter said in the news release. “The officer was able to un-holster his firearm and fired several rounds at the suspect. The suspect was hit multiple times and died on scene after being shot by the officer.” The object used by Schneider was an “airsoft” gun, “identical to a long barrel revolver and is believed to be the same gun used in the Armed Robbery.”
