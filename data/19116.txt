ROCK HILL, SC (WBTV) - Authorities in York County showed dramatic dash cam video Wednesday morning which shows a teen pointed her gun at police several times before they shot and killed her.

According to police, Yvette Williams allegedly robbed the Park Grocery store on East Main Street last Thursday.

As she was running from the business, a witness called police to tell them where she was running.

On Wednesday, South Carolina Solicitor Kevin Brackett met with the media to discuss the circumstances leading up to Williams' death.

When the officers arrived on the scene, Brackett said they assumed Williams had a 9mm gun since that's what the 911 caller told police. They later learned she actually had a BB gun.

Of the 11 shots fired by the two police officers, 3 of the shots actually hit Williams.

Bracket showed videotape recorded by the dash cam in the police cars. The tape showed the cops arriving on scene.

Police immediately instructed Williams to stop. The video showed Williams pulling the weapon from her clothing and pointing it toward the police.

The police immediately fired their weapons. Williams fell onto the ground and police said they thought she was in a neutral position.

The video then showed she pointed the gun at the cops a second time. They responded by firing their weapons.

As they walked up to Williams, the tape reveals she rolled over and grabbed her gun. That's when at least one of the officers fired the final shot which killed her.

Brackett would not release the videotape or the 911 call to the media. He said it was still being held as evidence in the matter.

He said it appeared the officers acted appropriately considering the chain of events leading up to Williams' death.
