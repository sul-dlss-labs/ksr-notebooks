Residents in a San Marcos neighborhood were asked to shelter-in-place while police investigated a shooting.

SAN MARCOS, Texas -- A SWAT standoff in San Marcos ended with a woman shot in the face and a man dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, San Marcos officials said in a press release.

According to the City of San Marcos, the incident began at a convenience store on State Highway 80 at 8 a.m. Witnesses told police they saw a woman screaming and attempting to leave a vehicle before a man pushed her back inside and drove off.

Police said they were able to track down the vehicle after obtaining the license plate number from a witness.

When police arrived at the home on Smith Lane, police said the woman fled the house with a gunshot wound to her face. She was taken to a hospital in South Austin and is expected to be OK.

The man, identified as Troy Ranard Jackson, 42, allegedly barricaded himself inside of the home while police attempted to make contact with him. Several homes in the area were evacuated while police and SWAT worked the scene, officials said.

Area residents were asked to shelter in place unless they were evacuated by law enforcement. The City said, "if you are on those streets already, stay calm and wait for police instruction."

Police said the standoff was brief, and they eventually entered the home after deeming it safe using a SWAT robot and found the man dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot. Residents returned to their homes at approximately 10 a.m.
