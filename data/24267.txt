Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation agents have confirmed that 2 victims and 1 suspect are dead following a domestic shooting and an officer-involved shooting Sunday in Grady County.

The Chickasha Police Department responded to reports of a domestic incident around 5 a.m. at a home in the 900 block of N. 12th St.

When officers arrived on scene they found two people dead inside, as well as 2 small children unharmed, officials said.

The suspect was spotted fleeing the scene and a police pursuit began. Oklahoma Highway Patrol overheard the dispute over Chickasha radio and joined the pursuit, along with Grady County Sheriff Deputies.

An OHP Trooper used a tactical defense intervention (TDI) maneuver on US Highway 81 causing the suspectâ€™s vehicle to roll.

Authorities shutdown both the northbound and southbound lanes of US 81 just north of Pocasset.

Shots were fired by all 3 agencies, officials said.

The suspect died at the scene. Authorities said a weapon was located inside of the suspect's vehicle.

The children have been placed in DHS custody until they can be placed with other relatives.

The identity of the 2 victims as well as the suspect remains unknown at this time.

OSBI has taken over the investigation of the officer-involved shooting as well as the domestic shooting in Chickasha.
