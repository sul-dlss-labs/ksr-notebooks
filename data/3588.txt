Chicago police shot to death a Niles man Friday night when he pulled out a handgun and aimed it at them, a department spokesman said.

The shooting occurred about 6:55 p.m. in an alley in the 4500 block of West 16th Street. Two Marquette Police District officers saw the man driving a 1987 Lincoln.

The officers were drawn to the man, who was alone, because he was driving suspiciously in the neighborhood, police spokesman Pat Camden said, so they tailed him. Eventually, the officers blocked him in the alley.

As the officers got out of their car, the man, Thomas Cerek, 45, of the 7300 block of West Greenleaf Street, emerged from his car. Cerek then pulled a .357 Magnum and was shot as he pointed it at an officer, Camden said.

A forensic team scoured the crime scene late Friday in the Lawndale neighborhood to determine if Cerek had fired a round at the two officers before they shot him "multiple times," Camden said.

Camden said the Police Department's Office of Professional Standards would review the actions of the officers.
