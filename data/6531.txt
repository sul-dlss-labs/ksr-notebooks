MAYWOOD â€” Maywood and Illinois State Police officials are investigating how an undercover drug operation turned deadly last week.

Police officials said Sgt. Dwayne Wheeler was conducting a drug investigation at 17th Avenue and Harrison Street about 3 p.m. Thursday when the alleged dealer fled the scene in his Lexus, striking several cars before trying to run down the officer. Wheeler fired one shot at the vehicle, killing Fred Henderson, 35, of Bellwood, authorities said.

Maywood Deputy Chief Phillip Bue said Henderson's car began to strike other vehicles when police officials tried to arrest him after an undercover officer bought drugs from him.

"He used his vehicle as a deadly weapon," said Bue, adding that Henderson hit four other cars, including a vehicle with children. Bue said the children and other drivers were unhurt.

Bue said the Police Department didn't endanger any lives in the drug buy. "It was a routine undercover police operation," he said.

Wheeler is on paid leave and is expected to return to work this week, Bue said. The state police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the case, a standard practice after an officer is involved in a shooting.

Bue said state police have indicated the shooting was justifiable. But a state police official in Chicago said he cannot comment on the shooting because authorities are still investigating.

According to court records, Henderson had two prior drug convictions.
