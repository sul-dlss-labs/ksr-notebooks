Police officers involved in the fatal shooting of an armed man last month at a Fort Collins hotel have been cleared of wrongdoing, and the use of “deadly physical force was legally justifiable and immediately necessary,” according to the Larimer County district attorney.

George Randall Newman, 26, was shot and killed by a police sergeant Oct. 1 at America’s Best Value Inn, 1809 North College Ave.

According to a letter from District Attorney Clifford Riedel: Newman had fired a gun through the floor of his hotel room, and the shot went through the roof of the room below. A guest in the room below called police about the incident, and officers responded. Officers called Newman’s hotel room phone, but he didn’t answer. The officers soon determined that a 3-year-old girl was in the room with Newman.

Concerned for the girl’s safety and the safety of others, three officers approached the door of the room and knocked. Initially, there was no answer. After a second knock, Newman opened the door armed with a sawed-off shotgun, according to the DA’s letter.

Commands were yelled at Newman to drop the weapon and show his hands. Newman did not comply, according to the letter.

Sgt. Justin Gallimore, armed with a rifle and within 4 feet of Newman, believed his life, the life of two officers with him and the life of the 3-year-old girl were all in “imminent risk,” Riedel’s letter said. Gallimore fired two shots, killing Newman.

The child in the room was safely reunited with her mother downstairs. An investigation into possible charges against the mother, who left her child with Newman inside the room after he had fired the initial shot through the floor, is ongoing.

Fort Collins police also are investigating Newman as a suspect in the death of Sherri Allman, whose body was found Oct. 4 during a welfare check at her home in the 1600 block of North College Avenue.
