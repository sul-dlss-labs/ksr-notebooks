VINELAND —

The man authorities believe beat his grandmother to death inside their East Chestnut Avenue apartment Tuesday afternoon was shot and killed by two city police officers when he refused to drop a baseball bat as he approached them, Cumberland County Prosecutor Jennifer Webb-McRae said this morning.

The prosecutor identified the man who died from gunshot wounds as Rashid Jihad Jones, 25, and the elderly woman Jones allegedly beat to death prior to police arriving on scene as Betty Buxton, 73.

Jones was pronounced dead at South Jersey Healthcare-Regional Medical Center, Buxton at Cooper University Hospital, in Camden.

Jones and Buxton lived together at apartment No. 33 in the “A” building at Regency East, located at 1123 E. Chestnut Ave, according to authorities.

Capt. Rudy Beu responded to Regency East apartment complex, located at 1123 E. Chestnut Ave., at about 3:30 p.m. Tuesday along with Patrolmen John Calio and Ryan Watkins after a 911 call was received from an unidentified male.

Witnesses told investigators Jones advanced toward the officers while “swinging the bat in a threatening manner,” according to Webb-McRae.

Beu and Calio are believed to have fired their duty weapons at Jones, Webb-McRae said.

The three officers found Buxton badly beaten inside her apartment after Jones had been wounded.

The Cumberland County Prosecutor’s Office is handling the investigation into the officer-involved shooting.

Beu, a 28-year veteran of the city police force, Calio, a 5-year veteran, and Watkins, who has been on the job for one year, all have been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation, according to Vineland Police Chief Timothy Codispoti.

“We are saddened for the families of the deceased and the officers involved, and our thoughts and prayers are with them,” Codispoti said this morning.
