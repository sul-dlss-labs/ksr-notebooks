The driver of a Ford F-150 who was killed after fleeing a traffic stop in Effingham County Saturday night has been identified as Robert Macklin Carlisle, 40, of Springfield.

Effingham County Sheriff's Office spokesman David Ehsanipoor said deputies attempted a traffic stop of Carlisle on Central Avenue near Honey Ridge Road around 11:30 p.m.

Deputies reported Carlisle ran a stop sign and had an equipment violation.

Carlisle fled down Central Avenue at a high rate of speed and continued north on Honey Ridge Road before rounding a curve, striking a tree and landing in water, Ehsanipoor said.

The chase reached speeds in excess of 80 mph and lasted less than two minutes.

"Deputies were in the process of setting up stop sticks just before the crash, they just didn't have time," Ehsanipoor said.

Carlisle was pronounced dead at the scene.

An autopsy will be performed Monday at the Georgia Bureau of Investigation crime lab in Savannah.

The Georgia State Patrol is investigating the incident.
