The Adams County Sheriff’s Office assisted with a high-speed pursuit that traveled through and ended in Adams County on Sept. 12.

The pursuit began in Franklin County, and Franklin County, Washington State Patrol and Connell Police Department pursued the car before traveling into Adams County.

The car was recorded of traveling at speeds in excess of 110 miles per hour.

As the vehicle approached the interchange in Ritzville, local law enforcement agencies attempted to deploy spike stripes to stop the vehicle, but they were ineffective.

As the pursuit changed from US Highway 395 onto eastbound Interstate 90, the suspect’s car lost two tires and came to a stop near Milepost 238. Law enforcement officers than instructed the suspect to exit the vehicle.

According to the Adams County Sheriff’s Office, police ordered the man out of the vehicle, but he ran on foot up an embankment and onto an overpass with train tracks below.

The suspect then jumped from the overpass onto a moving train below and was killed.

The suspect was later identified as Jordon R. Crybiskey, 32, of Kennewick.

The investigation is still ongoing throughout multiple law enforcement agencies.
