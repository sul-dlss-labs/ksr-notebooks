No criminal charges will be filed against a LaSalle police officer who shot and killed an armed man who had pointed a shotgun at the officer, according to investigators.

On Feb. 6, Seth Keo Mallard, 20, was shot at about 2:40 a.m. in Weld County near U.S. Highway 85 and County Road 394 when officers responded to a report of a “suspicious vehicle.”

“When the officer confronted Mallard, Mallard leveled a shotgun at him, thus, the officer fired in self-defense,” according to a March 22 letter from District Attorney Michael J. Rourke to LaSalle Police Chief Carl Harvey on the officer-involved shooting investigation.

“The officer reasonably believed when he fired his weapon that he was in danger of death or serious bodily injury,” the letter stated.

An investigation by the Critical Response Incident Team determined that Mallard had “wielded the shotgun and made a threatening statement to the officer.”

The investigation and subsequent report found that “the officer was justified in discharging his firearm.”

The officer, who was placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the CRIT investigation, has not been identified.

Mallard, according to the letter, had been associated with “known criminal gangs” and “there have been threats made to injure or kill individuals associated with this incident. Therefore, the involved officer’s identity will not be released.”

Since the shooting, Frederick police have identified Mallard as a transient who was involved in the theft of 73 firearms and ammunition from Snoopy’s Guns, 334 Fifth St., overnight on Feb. 2.
