A deranged man fatally stabbed his grandfather in a Newark senior-citizen building yesterday – then moments later, killed a 79-year-old newspaper carrier who stumbled upon the bloody scene, cops said.

The suspect, Abraham Slocum, 24, was later shot to death by cops.

James Nevith, a retired chef who lived in the building at 1 Court Street, stepped off the elevator on the ninth floor to make a newspaper delivery and saw Slocum in the hall, standing over his grandfather, also named Abraham Slocum, sources said.

Slocum pushed Nevith back into the elevator and stabbed him repeatedly in the stomach, said Nevith’s sister-in-law, Susan Samuel

“He was delivering the last paper on his route. It was just bad timing,” she said.

Nevith’s wife, Darnell, 45, usually accompanied him on his early-morning rounds delivering the Star-Ledger, which he had done for 12 years after his retirement, but he told her he’d go alone so she could get ready for church.

“No, angel, stay here. I’ll be right back. I’ll go and deliver this last paper. Don’t go to church without me,” he told her, Samuel said.

“That just shows you how fate works,” she said. “She was going to go with him.”

Cops arrived at the building around 7 a.m. after getting a 911 call and were met by a security guard who told them a man covered in blood was inside, holding a knife.

They found Nevith lying on the elevator floor and Slocum, clutching a bloody knife, standing over his granddad’s body, police and neighbors said.

Slocum ignored police orders to drop the knife and instead strode toward the cops, brandishing the weapon, authorities said.

When pepper spray failed to subdue him, two of the four cops on the scene fired, police said.

Slocum was wounded but managed to break away and run back into his grandfather’s apartment. He emerged seconds later and threw the knife handle at cops.

When he continued to wave the blade, the cops fired again, killing him, officials said.
