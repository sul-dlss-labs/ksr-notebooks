POINTE A LA HACHE (AP) - The bodies of two men, including one who had fled from officers the day before, were found in the Mississippi River in unrelated incidents Sunday.

The Plaquemines Parish sheriff's office says someone called the sheriff's office Sunday afternoon after spotting a body near the Scarsdale ferry near Braithwaite. Deputies went to the scene and found the body of 26-year-old George Shaw, of Violet, in the river.

Deputies had stopped Shaw's car for speeding early Saturday. Shaw got out of the car, ran and eluded the pursuing deputies. Investigators assume Shaw tried to hide in the water and drowned.

In the other incident, a man's body was found at Sharko's Dock in Venice Sunday morning. The 47-year-old man fished in the area regularly but his name has not been released.

Autopsies will be performed Monday to determine how the men died.
