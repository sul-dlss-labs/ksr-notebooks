GREENSBORO â€” A Guilford County sheriff's deputy fatally shot a 17-year-old boy yesterday who had threatened him with a knife at a home in northwest Greensboro, authorities said.

Deputy Barry Glosson shot Christian Welland Rook of 4810 Moutline Drive in the chest about 12:30 p.m., the Guilford County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Rook later died at Moses Cone Hospital.

Rook's grandmother called 911 and told a dispatcher that her grandson had a knife and was threatening to cut people, the sheriff's office said. The grandmother and other residents of her home had locked themselves in the house, and Rook was trying to get into the home.

The sheriff's office told FOX8/WGHP-TV that the incident started as a fight between Rook and his brother.

When Glosson arrived at the house, Rook came at Glosson with the knife and Glosson shot him in the chest, the sheriff's office said.

Glosson, a 10-year veteran, was treated at the hospital after he had chest pains after the shooting.

The State Bureau of Investigation will investigate the incident, which is routine when a law-enforcement officer is involved in a shooting.
