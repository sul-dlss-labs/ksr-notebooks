A 27-year-old man fatally shot by Chicago police in an alley in the Humboldt Park neighborhood was identified Saturday as Mario Rojas Rodriguez, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Rodriguez was spotted in the alley in the 1200 block of North Harding Avenue about 7 p.m. Friday. Police had tried to stop him earlier for speeding, but he eluded them in a brief car chase, police said. In the alley, an officer tried to pull Rodriguez from his car, but Rodriguez allegedly stepped on the gas pedal. The car ran over the officer's foot and pinned him to a pole, police said. The officer shot Rodriguez through the windshield.
