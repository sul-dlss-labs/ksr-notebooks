Felipe Valdovinos, a 27-year-old Latino, died Sunday, Sept. 20, after he was shot by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies at Alondra Boulevard and the onramp to the southbound 710 Freeway in Compton, officials said.

Deputies saw Valdovinos and an unidentified man walking out of a "darkened alley and attempted to make contact with them," according to a statement released by the Sheriff's Department.

Valdovinos reportedly ran from the deputies, then turned around and began to shoot at them, according to the statement. One deputy was shot in the leg.

The deputies returned fire and chased Valdovinos to the onramp, where he was met by three more deputies. The deputies shot Valdovinos several times about 2:45 a.m., and he was pronounced dead at the scene, according to the statement.

The deputy who was shot was treated and released from a hospital shortly after he was injured, authorities said. According to the statement, Valdovinos had allegedly robbed a taco truck shortly before his encounter with the deputies.
