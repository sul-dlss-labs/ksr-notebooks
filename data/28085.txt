Police say they were called to investigate an altercation at a North Monroe Street restaurant before an officer shot and killed an armed man.

The Tallahassee Police Department identified 69-year-old Wilbon C. Woodard as the man shot outside the Super China Buffet at about 1:40 a.m. Tuesday.

In an update Wednesday night, police explained they were first called to a gas station across the street. Then they learned the altercation reported was actually outside the North Monroe Street restaurant.

“In furtherance of the investigation, the involved officer went to the Super China Buffet parking lot where he encountered an armed suspect,” TPD spokeswoman Rachelle Denmark said in a press release. “This confrontation ultimately led to the officer having to discharge his firearm.”

The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on administrative leave but has not yet been named.

Tuesday's incident is the second fatal shooting of a suspect by TPD. In late March, 31-year-old Mychael Johnson was shot in what is being described as a violent carjacking attempt that turned into a harrowing chase and ended with one officer killing the suspect.

Police continue to ask anyone with information to contact (850) 891-4200 or CrimeStoppers anonymously at (850) 574-TIPS.
