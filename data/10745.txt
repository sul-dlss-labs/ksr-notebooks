TARRANT, Alabama -- Authorities today are investigating the shooting deaths of two men Sunday, one of whom died shortly after he led Tarrant police on a high-speed chase.



Preston Roy Floyd, 25, was pronounced dead at 7:18 p.m. at a Tarrant home. The suspected shooter, William Jordan Keith, 20, was pronounced dead about 15 minutes later, said Jefferson County Deputy Coroner Phillip Russell.

Repeated efforts to reach Tarrant police were unsuccessful. Coroner's authorities gave this account based on police reports to them:

Tarrant police were called to a shooting at 1610 Brewton Street shortly after 7 p.m. When officers arrived, a woman there told officers that her boyfriend, Floyd, was visiting when her ex-boyfriend, Keith, started banging on the back door. When Floyd went to investigate, he was met by Keith. The two reportedly exchanged shots.

Floyd retreated into the back bedroom, and was followed by Keith who was still firing at him. Floyd fell dead on the bedroom floor.

Keith then took Floyd's gun and the ex-girlfriend's Kia Sorento and fled. Lawmen from at least two agencies pursued him on Alabama 79. The cars turned off onto an abandoned road, where Key continued driving until the road became impassable and he stopped. Two Tarrant police cars pulled up behind him. The officers reported they heard a shot fired from the vehicle, and they returned fire.

Officers approached the vehicle, and found Keith unresponsive in the driver's seat of the car.

An autopsy will be performed today to determine how Keith died.
