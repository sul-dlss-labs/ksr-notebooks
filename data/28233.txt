A cause of death and manner of death were not listed Monday.

The shooting

About 3:43 a.m. May 26, officers were called to the 5900 block of Ayers Street for a burglary in progress, according to a department news release.

"Officers received information that three males were seen forcing their way into the residence," the release reads. "When the officers arrived, they entered the residence, and were confronted with a male suspect brandishing a handgun."

Officers Jacob O'Sullivan and Rene Rodriguez discharged their service weapons, striking the suspect, the department said in a news release. It's the department's practice to identify officers involved in shootings.

O'Sullivan has been with the department for six years, and Rodriguez has been with the department for about a year, the release states.

Anthony Hinojosa, 19, and Marco Molina, 18, were found inside the home and taken into custody on suspicion of burglary of a habitation with intent to commit other felony, the release states.

The officers were placed on paid administrative leave, per department policy.
