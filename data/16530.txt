San Jose police fatally shot a man who allegedly reached for a handgun when contacted by officers late Sunday night.

Police on Monday said the man fatally shot was a suspect in a homicide that happened on Thursday.

Sunday's incident occured at 10:10 p.m. at a strip mall on the 3100 block of Senter Road near East Capitol Expressway, police said of San Jose's seventh officer-involved shooting of 2015.

Sergeant Enrique Garcia said police approached the suspect while conducting a follow-up investigation. However, a pair of officers fired their duty weapons and struck the man when he made a move to grab his own firearm.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene, police said, adding that no other injuries were reported.

Sources close to the investigation told NBC Bay Area that the suspect was a "big fish" who San Jose investigators have been actively tracking. They also said that he may have been a suspect in a homicide, which occurred in a Lundy Avenue office on Aug. 13.

Sunday's incident was the department's seventh officer-involved shooting in 2015 and the third one in a week, police said.

NBC Bay Area's Raji Ramanathan and Bay City News Service contributed to this report.
