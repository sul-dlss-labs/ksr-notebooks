A man died at AnMed Health Medical Center Sunday morning after being taken there by Anderson Police Department officers who responded to a call about him acting strange, said deputy Anderson County Coroner Don McCown.

McCown said Benston Clinkscales, 26, went into cardiac arrest around 12:20 a.m. and an emergency room physician was not able to revive him.

Clinkscales was declared dead at 12:51 a.m.

Anderson Police Department spokesman Lt. David Creamer said that the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division was investigating the death.

Police Chief Jim Stewart said information from the police department would be limited because of the state investigation.

Clinkscales' mother called 911 around 11:15 p.m. Saturday, saying her son was acting strange and had been drinking heavily before putting his arm through a window, McCown said.

McCown said police who arrived at the residence found a belligerent man and they used a Taser on him, but the effects didn't last long because Clinkscales removed the prongs from the Taser.

McCown said officers eventually were able to give Clinkscales some medical care before an ambulance arrived and he was restrained to a stretcher and taken to the hospital.

McCown said Clinkscales continued to be belligerent at the hospital and was restrained there as well.

McCown said an autopsy is scheduled for Monday but his preliminary work indicates the restraints were not a factor in Clinkscales' death.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating the death because the man was in the custody of Anderson Police Department officers at the time, said Thom Berry, a spokesman for the state agency.
