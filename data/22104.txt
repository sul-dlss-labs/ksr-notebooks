WATERFORD TOWNSHIP, Mich. – A man was shot and killed by police after a tense standoff at a home in Waterford Township Thursday morning.

Waterford Township police released this information:

At 3:05 a.m. this morning, Waterford Police received a 911 call of a domestic dispute in the 2000 block of Sunhill Drive. The female caller reported she had left the residence after being assaulted by her husband.

Officers responded to the home and were able to establish contact by phone with the husband. During those conversations, he threatened to kill Officers, burn down his house, and kill himself. While setting up a perimeter, Officers heard a gunshot come from within the house.

After hearing the gunshot, Waterford Police were able to re-establish contact by phone and confirm the husband had not harmed himself. The Oakland County Sheriff’s Office SWAT team was requested and responded to the area.

As the SWAT team was taking over the perimeter, the husband exited the house. Once he became aware Officers were outside, he retreated back inside the home.

Sporadic phone contact continued with the subject during which time he reaffirmed his threats to kill police, himself, and burn down the house.

Shortly after the last phone contact, the subject exited the house with a loaded shotgun. He walked through the side tree line and charged an Officer at which time he was shot.

A SWAT team medic treated the 28 year old Waterford man until the Waterford Regional Fire Department arrived. He was transported to McLaren Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 6:20am.

Upon entering the house, Officers found that gasoline had been poured throughout several rooms and the gas burners on the stove had been left open.

Waterford Police and the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office special investigations unit continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding this incident.
