SILVER SPRING, Md. â€” Montgomery County Police said a man was fatally shot Thursday in an officer-involved shooting in White Oak.

Around 2:15 p.m. officers from the third district were dispatched to the 1500 block of Hadden Manor Court for a weapon complaint. Police said 30-year-old Finan H. Berhe had thrown a rock at his neighbor's window and yelled for the neighbors to call the police. Neighbors who witnessed the event told police Berhe was holding a butcher's knife.

When the first officer arrived, police said the officer got out of their car and repeatedly asked Berhe to drop the weapon and get on the ground. Police said he did not comply and rushed at the officer, who retreated a bit, and Berhe began walking backward. The responding officer again asked Berhe to get on the ground and drop the knife, at which time Berhe "ran aggressively while holding the knife straight to the officer," according to police.

The officer shot Berhe, who went down, and the officer began administering first aid, police said. Berhe was transported to a local hospital, where police said he died. The officer was not injured in the shooting.

Montgomery County Police Chief Marcus Jones said the incident was videoed by neighbors, and the officer involved in the shooting was wearing a body camera. Footage from the neighbors, the officer's body camera and statements from witnesses are all being reviewed. Jones said the name of the officer involved will be released at a later date. Montgomery County Police identified the officer as a 17-year veteran of the department. Per protocol, the officer has been placed on administrative, paid leave.

The case is under investigation, and Jones said when his department is finished they will present the case to the Howard County State's Attorney's office for review.
