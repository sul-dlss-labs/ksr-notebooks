Two people are dead after an intense SWAT standoff in Northwest Miami-Dade, according to police.

Officers shot and killed 30-year-old Adrein Herrera after he took several shots at officers who tried to talk him out of a house on Northwest 201st Terrace in Miami Gardens.

Inside, police found Herrera's mother, 70-year-old Dinacela Herrera, dead from a gun shot wound believe to come from her son's gun. Authorities are still investigating why Herrera murdered his mother.

"We just heard loud gunshots," said witness Osmier Canar. Residents who live nearby the house weren't allowed into their homes for several hours.

Police units responded to a call of shots being fired just after 10:30 p.m. last night at a house.

According to police, a man had barricaded himself in the house, touching off a long stand-off that lasted nearly seven hours, with reports that the man was firing at police through the house's windows.

After negotiations with Herrera failed, the SWAT unit was forced to enter the house, shooting and killing the man, police said. Once inside the house, police found a woman dead.
