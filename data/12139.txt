Your son earns his Eagle Scout Award. Your church hosts a bake sale. Your councilman’s fence violates city ordinances.

But is it news?

Learn what makes a happening “newsworthy” and get tips on working with staffers to publicize your story or event at the next gathering in the Sun News Lounge.

Editors and reporters will be on hand from 3 to 5 p.m. Wednesday, May 15, at the Lounge located in The Sun’s office at 290 N. D St., Suite 102, San Bernardino. Staffers will discuss how to contact the newsroom; what is news and what is not; opportunities to tell your story online; and the difference between news stories and letters to the editor and other submissions printed on the Opinion pages. There will also be time for a Q&A session with editors and writers.

Space is limited; to RSVP please email Metro Editor Ryan Carter at ryan.carter@inlandnewspapers.com or call 909-386-3810.
