COMPTON – A woman wounded by Compton sheriff’s deputies after failing to drop the gun she was pointing at a man was pronounced dead at a hospital, a deputy said today.

The shooting occurred at 4:25 p.m. Wednesday at Compton Boulevard and Willowbrook Avenue, said Deputy Grace Medrano of the Sheriff’s Headquarters Bureau.

Deputies initially responded to a man with a gun call, Medrano said.

“Upon arrival, they saw a female pointing a gun at a male outside the gas station,” she said. “Deputies gave the female several commands to drop the gun, however she did not comply. Fearing for the safety of the victim, that the female suspect would shoot and kill him, deputies fired at the female suspect striking her.”

The suspect was transported to a hospital where she was pronounced dead, Medrano said.

“It was later determined that the female had fired a round at the victim prior to the deputies’ arrival. The suspect’s handgun was recovered at the scene,” she said.

“Detectives have learned that the suspect and victim have children in common,” Medrano said. “The investigation is still ongoing.”
