CLINCH CO., GA (WALB) - Tonight, we know more about why a Clinch County deputy shot and killed a man last week.

Deputy Lamar Lankford remains on administrative leave after shooting 59-year-old Vernon Mathis Tuesday.

Sheriff Winston Peterson says Mathis went to Camp Creek Church and threatened to kill Christians with a machete.

Deputies were waiting for him when he returned home.

The Sheriff says Mathis began hitting a patrol car with the machete and smashing the windows.

Officer Stanley Stalvey tried to tase Mathis, and Lankford shot him when he got too close to Deputy Stalvey.

"He shot him with the taser, and that didn't stop him. And when he was in 4 of 5 foot of him, Deputy Lankford shot him," said Sheriff Peterson.

Deputy Lankford has been with the Sheriff's Office since the 70's. He will remain on administrative leave until GBI agents finish their investigation.
