ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – A suspect is dead after an overnight shootout with Albuquerque police. APD says the man walked up to a police officer, words were exchanged, and shots started flying back and forth.

Police say detectives were conducting a surveillance operation in the area when a man with a gun approached an officer’s vehicle, and soon after they were shooting at each other.

That surveillance operation began in the Northeast Heights and took them to General Stilwell near Central and Zuni. Police say when that armed suspect approached the detective, there was what they call an “interaction” between the two.

They say that’s when shots were exchanged, but they’re still trying to piece together what happened.

“We will be out here most of the night because there are three scenes we are working to process. We have no further information at this time,” Deputy Chief Harold Medina said.

At this point, police have not said where those other scenes are or if the gunman had anything to do with the initial investigation. It’s also not known if the suspect or the detective opened fire first.

The officer had minor injuries and was treated at the scene. Police aren’t saying how he was hurt.

Police have not released the name of the suspect who was killed, or said if the exchange was captured on the officer’s camera.

What’s also unclear is if the police vehicle the suspect walked up to was a marked unit. Special investigations detectives often use unmarked cars.
