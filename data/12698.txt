OAKLAND — A motorcyclist fleeing from police was killed Friday night after he drove into oncoming traffic, crashed into a guardrail and was thrown from the bike, authorities said Saturday.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Alameda County Coroner’s Office declined to release his name Saturday pending a police investigation.

No one else was injured.

It was not clear Saturday where the chase by the California Highway Patrol began, but the motorcyclist was speeding when the crash occurred on south Seminary Avenue near Picardy Drive in East Oakland on Friday at 11 p.m., authorities said.
