NAPA, CA â€”The Napa County Sheriff's Office has released video and a detailed account of a recent fatal deputy-involved shooting. Napa resident Brandan Reid Nylander, 24, was shot twice by Napa County sheriff's Deputy Gregg Lee, and died at the scene of the shooting April 24 near the Napa County Airport.

In a briefing held Tuesday, sheriff's officials said Nylander apparently intended to commit "suicide by cop." Nylander left his family a suicide note, and his "accumulated actions" before his death also indicated he intended to end his life, Napa County Sheriff John Robertson told members of the media.

The officer-involved shooting happened at 2:27 p.m. April 24 in the 4000 block of Airport Road in Napa. According to a timeline of events leading up to the shooting, the sheriff's office says Nylander robbed ammunition for his shotgun from Walmart then led Deputy Lee on a chase.

Two rounds that Nylander stole in Walmart were later found in his shotgun, Roberston said. Napa police dispatchers got a 911 call at 2:09 p.m. about the robbery. Dispatchers said a man reportedly went into the Walmart on Lincoln Avenue with a hammer and smashed a glass case to grab ammunition. As he left the store, he reportedly threw the hammer which hit a Walmart employee.

Dispatchers broadcast a description of the robbery suspect and his car, which Lee spotted at 2:25 p.m. as Nylander drove south on state Highway 29 toward Airport Boulevard.

Lee signaled for Nylander to stop but instead, Nylander drove erratically, changed lanes and drove onto the highway shoulder at speeds up to 75 mph, according to the sheriff's office.
