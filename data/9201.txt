The Minnesota State Patrol has released video of a fatal shooting in Virginia, Minn., last month involving a trooper.

Donnie Joe Lira, 66, was shot to death on June 12. Trooper Travis Pearson confronted Lira after Lira reportedly fired shots at the home where his estranged wife and her children were staying.

St. Louis County Attorney Melanie Ford earlier cleared Pearson of wrongdoing. She says Lira ignored Pearson's commands and pointed a gun at the trooper before he was shot.

The video taken from a camera mounted in Pearson's patrol car appears to confirm the sequence of events. It shows Lira jacking a shell into the chamber of his weapon and raising it toward the camera. An unseen officer is heard shouting, "Drop the gun or I will kill you!" The video ends as Lira raises his weapon.

Pearson is back on regular duty.
