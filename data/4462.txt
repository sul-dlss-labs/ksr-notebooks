A San Bernardino County sheriff’s patrol deputy fatally shot a Rubidoux man driving an allegedly stolen car, authorities said Tuesday.

Govanni Martinez, 22, was pronounced dead in a driveway in the 18600 block of 10th Street in Bloomington after the shooting Monday, a sheriff’s spokeswoman said. The shooting occurred after the deputy, aware that the car was stolen, ordered Martinez to show his hands, the spokeswoman said.

Instead, Martinez backed the car toward the deputy, who fired, according to the spokeswoman.
