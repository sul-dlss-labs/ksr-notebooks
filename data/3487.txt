A 27-year-old motorcyclist from North Aurora died Thursday of injuries he sustained in a collision with an Aurora police squad car.

An investigation indicates the motorcyclist was at fault in the Wednesday night wreck, said police spokesman Dan Ferrelli. Neither alcohol nor drugs appear to have been a factor.

Sonexay Vongkorad of the 600 block of Chesterfield Lane was riding his 2002 Suzuki motorcycle east on East New York Street in Aurora about 10:54 p.m. when he apparently lost control near the intersection of Parkside Avenue.

The motorcycle skidded on its side and collided with a westbound squad car being driven by a 57-year-old officer. Vongkorad's motorcycle hit the front of the squad car, Ferrelli said.
