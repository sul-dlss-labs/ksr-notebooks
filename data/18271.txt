Mackinac County Prosecuting Attorney, J. Stuart Spencer, has announced that no criminal charges will be filed against Michigan State Police Trooper Justin Clark for the fatal shooting of Dean Allen Bruning on October 4, 2016.

The decision follows the review of a thorough investigation conducted by the Michigan State Police. "A review of the evidence establishes that this tragic death is a result of the lawful use of force by the Michigan State Trooper involved," Spencer said.

Law enforcement was dispatched to 2302 West Chard Road in Hessel, Michigan, for a wellness check on Bruning. After multiple attempts to reach Bruning in order to verify his wellbeing, law enforcement entered the residence with loud announcements of who they were. Law enforcement observed an individual standing behind a curtain, raising a handgun and pointing it toward law enforcement. The individual, later identified as Bruning, stepped out from behind the curtain and continued aiming the handgun at the officers. Trooper Clark, fearing for his life and those other two law enforcement in the home, fire two shots from his service handgun striking and killing Bruning.

"This is a tragic and terrible loss for the Bruning family. What started out as concern for a potentially suicidal individual and a request for a wellness check has ended with the death of Bruning. Likewise, this is a horrible experience for Trooper Clark. No law enforcement officer ever wants to be faced with the decision to shoot or not to shoot in order to protect another's life. My thoughts and prayers are with the Bruning family as well as Trooper Clark," said Spencer. Prosecutor Spencer expresses his gratitude to the Michigan State Police, the Mackinac County Sheriff's Office, and the Clark Township EMS personnel that responded to the scene. Spencer would especially like to thank Detective Sergeant Gary A. Demers of the Michigan State Police-St. Ignace Post, who led the investigation.
