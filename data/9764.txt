Dnary Fowler, a 19-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police Sunday, Jan. 2, in the 8700 block of McKinley Avenue in Green Meadows, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Authorities entered a ransacked home just before midnight and discovered five residents bound inside.

Fowler, armed with a Tec-9, was also in the home. It appeared he was in the midst of robbing them, officials said.

Police confronted him as he tried to escape out the back door, authorities said. An officer then shot Fowler, who died at a hospital, said Officer Sara Faden of the Los Angeles Police Department.

A second suspect was arrested at the scene. One resident had to be taken to a hospital for minor injuries but has since been released.

Faden said an investigation into the shooting has been opened, and that it was unclear if the slain suspect had pointed a gun at officers.
