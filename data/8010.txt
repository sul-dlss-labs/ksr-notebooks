A Manhattan federal jury has cleared NYPD Sgt. William Flores of any civil wrongdoing for using excessive force in relation to the fatal 2009 shooting of an emotionally-disturbed man who came at officers with a knife.

The family of Mauricio Jaquez alleged in a lawsuit that Flores — who fired the fifth of five bullets to hit the Bronx father-of-three — did so when he was no longer a threat.

They claimed Mauricio Jaquez already lay dying on the ground when Flores discharged the last bullet — constituting excessive force.

Flores and other responding officers contested that Mauricio Jaquez was pushing himself off the ground — brandishing the blade — when the sergeant fired the final bullet.

A jury of seven sided with Flores, deciding after just two hours Mauricio Jaquez was pushing himself up — with a knife in his hand — and that the sergeant didn't use excessive force firing the fifth round.

Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, who represents Jaquez's family, disagreed with the jury's decision and said there were a number of legal errors during the trial.

"I think the jury got it wrong on the facts," he said. "We're looking forward to an appeal."

Flores declined to comment outside the courthouse.

Patricia Miller, chief of the city Law Department's special federal litigation division, said in a statement that the jury vindicated Flores' actions.

"This was a tragic case involving the NYPD's response to a distress call involving a man wielding a knife," Miller said. "The jury determined that the split-second decision by the sergeant was justified, and we believe that verdict was consistent with the evidence."
