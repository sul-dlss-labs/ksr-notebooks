A man was shot and killed by police officers in Queens on Wednesday night after he fired a gun inside a bar and at officers who pursued him, the police said.

The police received a call around 9:22 p.m. about a shooting inside the Irish Hillside Inn on Hillside Avenue at 168th Street in Jamaica. Officers from the 103rd and 107th Precincts answered the call, and witnesses directed them to the man, who was outside the bar and fled when the officers tried to engage him, the police said.

The man ran along 168th Street and turned right on Highland Avenue, where he was met by police officers. He stopped, faced the officers and fired several shots before turning and running again, this time down 168th Place toward Hillside Avenue, the police said. The man turned and fired at the officers a second time, and they returned fire, striking him, the police said.

The man was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and died a short time later. His name was not immediately released on Wednesday.
