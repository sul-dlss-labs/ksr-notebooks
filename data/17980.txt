A Franklin County deputy shot and killed a suspect who officials say brandished a knife in Estill Springs early Wednesday evening.

The deputy initially pulled Michael Adams over in a traffic stop, but when the deputy identified Adams as having warrants for his arrest, the suspect got out of the car and fled on foot, according to Franklin County Sheriff's Office spokesperson Chris Guess.

The deputy chased Adams in a vehicle and then got out to chase him on foot, Guess said.

When the deputy attempted to arrest Adams on the 200 block of Circle Drive, he pulled a knife in an attempt to harm the deputy, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation in a news release.

That is when the deputy shot and killed the 33-year-old.

TBI agents are investigating the scene of the officer-involved shooting, TBI spokesperson Josh DeVine said. They will submit their findings to the district attorney general for consideration.

TBI also said it does not reveal the identity of officers involved in shootings as a practice.
