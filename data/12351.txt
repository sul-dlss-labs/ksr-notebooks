A man is dead after a standoff that ended in an officer-involved shooting just after midnight Saturday morning.

Dallas police said they received word that 39-year old Stoney Eugene Rawlinson, a person of interest in a homicide, wanted to turn himself in to police.

According to Dallas police, arrangements were made for the man to meet with uniformed officers in a parking lot in the 6500 block of Skillman Avenue near Abrams Road.

When officers arrived they said the man was sitting inside his car armed with a gun, according to his father, Stoney Eugene Rawlinson Sr., it was a 12-gauge shotgun.

"The officers gave loud verbal commands for the suspect to drop his weapon, Dallas Police Sr. Cpl. Demarquis Black said. "The suspect pointed his weapon at the officers, and fearing for their lives they fired their weapons."

The SWAT Unit was called in since the man was still in the vehicle and officers were unsure of his condition.

After a brief standoff police determined the man was dead inside the car.

Rawlinson's father has strong feelings over the incident.

"He was giving himself up last night and I felt like he was executed last night," he said.

According to criminal records, Rawlinson's past included a single conviction in Mesquite for criminal mischief above $20,000 for which he recieved deferred ajudication.
