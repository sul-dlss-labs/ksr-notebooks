CLERMONT, Fla. — The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating after a Lake County man was killed during an officer-involved shooting Saturday.

The man, who has a history of mental illness, died Saturday afternoon in a Clermont home after an argument with his parents ended when deputies were forced to open fire, according to the Lake County Sheriff’s Office.

Daniel Davis, 58, was visiting his parents’ home on Firestone Circle in a subdivision at the Green Valley Country Club when he caused a fight and refused to leave, said sheriff’s office spokesman Lt. John Herrell.

Two deputies arrived at the home shortly before 3:30 p.m. to order Davis to leave the residence. The man pulled out a knife during the encounter, Herrell said.

“He was initially Tased but at that point he was able to remove the prongs of the Taser,” Herrell said. “He said, ‘Someone is gonna die today,' as he lunged at the deputy with the knife.”

Davis was then fatally shot by one of the deputies.

“He actually had told his mother that he was going to die today,” Herrell said.

Florida Department of Law Enforcement records reveal Davis’ criminal history includes battery on a law-enforcement officer.

In 2005, his mother filed two injunctions against him, records show.

Davis was released a week ago from a mental-health facility in Orange County.

His parents told investigators that though they’re upset their son was killed, they understand why the deputy used lethal force, Herrell said.

“This is a very quiet neighborhood,” resident Gilbert Colorado said. “I'm very surprised.”

Both deputies, neither of whom was identified, were placed on administrative leave while FDLE reviews the shooting, which is a standard procedure.
