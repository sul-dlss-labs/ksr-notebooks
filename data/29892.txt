HOUSTON – Both directions of Interstate 10 are back open Thursday in Schulenburg after a chase that started in Houston resulted in a standoff and a man committing suicide, according to authorities.

Officials said the chase started after a person in the vehicle fired shots at a deputy from the Harris County Precinct 5 Constable’s Office around 3 a.m. Thursday.

Fayette County Sheriff Keith Korenek said he was notified of the pursuit at 4:18 a.m. Several agencies including Fayette County deputies, Schulenburg and Flatonia police officers and Department Of Public Safety troopers all responded to the pursuit.

The chase passed through Houston and Colorado County where authorities said they used spike strips to damage the tires. Authorities said the driver continued to drive on rims until finally coming to a stop Schulenburg, where he refused to get out.

Deputies said the driver continued to flash a handgun and law enforcement shut down I-10 in the area while they worked to resolve the situation.

Following an hourslong standoff and multiple attempts at negotiation, authorities said the driver shot himself about 8:50 a.m.

Officials said the driver’s identity has not yet been released, and they are working to notify the family members.
