Ventura Saenz, a 19-year-old Latino young man, was shot in the face by a sheriff's deputy near the intersection of Pixley Avenue and Muriel Avenue in Compton; he died at 1:58 a.m. Saturday, May 12.

Saenz died in an exchange of gunfire, according to the Sheriff's Department's account. The deputy pulled over Saenz , who was driving a pickup, on suspicion of making an illegal U-turn. Saenz stopped the pickup, then sped off when the deputy approached. The deputy got back in his patrol car and stopped him again.

Saenz reportedly did not obey orders to get out of the pickup, and fired a gun at the deputy, missing him. The deputy fired back and hit him. Saenz was transported to a hospital, where he died. A passenger in the pickup truck, an 18-year-old Latino man, was taken into custody. It was the fourth killing by a law-enforcement officer in four days.
