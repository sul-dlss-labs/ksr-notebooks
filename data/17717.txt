DELAND, Fla. â€“ A woman was arrested Sunday following a deputy-involved shooting that closed the northbound side of 17-92 near the intersection of Firehouse Road in DeLand.

The Volusia County Sheriff's Office said deputies responded to an armed robbery at 12:30 p.m. at the Orange City Park N Ride on Saxon Boulevard, where victims reported their wallets were stolen at gunpoint. They then provided a suspect and vehicle description to the deputies.

Deputies said they conducted a traffic stop at 12:51 p.m. on the suspect vehicle in DeLand. The woman driver, identified as Erin Casey Finney, 24, complied and was taken into custody, but the male suspect, identified as Donald Edward Brown III, 32, refused to comply with the deputies' request that he show his hands.

The Sheriff's Office said three of their deputies were forced to fire at Brown, who was found to have a knife in his hand following the shooting. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Finney is charged with murder while engaged in a felony, robbery with a deadly weapon and drug possession. She was issued no bond at her first appearance on Monday.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it will be investigating the incident.
