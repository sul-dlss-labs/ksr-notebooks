A 27-year-old man died in an officer-involved shooting this morning in Frederick, Md.

At about 5:30 a.m., Frederick Police Department officers responded to a report of a domestic incident. While investigating, the officers received an additional report of shots being fired at passing vehicles.

The suspect, Patrick John Fischer II, 27, of Frederick, allegedly shot at a moving vehicle, striking it and the driver. The injuries to the driver were non-life threatening.

Officers arrived on scene and commanded Ficsher to drop his sawed-off semi-automatic rifle, according to the Frederick Police Deparment. Instead, Fischer pointed his weapon at the officers, who then fired at Fischer.

Officers performed first aid until EMS arrived, but Fischer later died of his injuries at Frederick Memorial Hospital.

Fischer was also believed to be the husband involved in the earlier domestic incident.



The Frederick Police Department is currently conducting an investigation into the shooting that occurred on Himes Avenue at Ellison Court. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. The officers involved in the incident have been identified Officer Kenneth Mogle, a two-year veteran and Officer Charles Lawson, a seven-year veteran.



The Frederick Police Department is investigating the shooting with the Frederick County State’s Attorney’s Office.
