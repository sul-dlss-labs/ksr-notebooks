SUMTER CO., GA (WALB) - Georgia State Patrol says an Americus man was killed and a woman injured when their car ran off the road and overturned during a high speed chase with Sumter County Sheriff's Deputies early Friday morning.

The driver of the car Edgar Brown, III was killed and his passenger Lashsha Boone was airlifted to a Macon hospital after their car lost control in a curve on Georgia Highway 49 South near Pa's Road around 5:20AM, when both were thrown from the car.

Sumter County Sheriff's Deputies had been called to a domestic disturbance on Ron Circle and when they were arriving to the house they saw the car pulled out of the driveway and turn onto U.S. 280.

Deputies activated their lights to pull the car over when Brown sped away. Troopers say speeds in the chase at times reached over 100 miles per hour.
