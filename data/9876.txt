Miguel Sanchez Jr., a 21-year-old Latino, died Tuesday, Feb. 15, hours after he was shot by an off-duty officer in the 1500 block of West 224th Street in Harbor Gateway, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

An off-duty policeman parked his personal car near Denker Avenue and West 224th Street on Feb. 14 about 11:45 p.m. when he saw Sanchez running toward him with a gun, according to an LAPD news release.

Authorities said Sanchez pointed the gun at the policeman, at which point the officer-involved shooting occurred.

Paramedics were called and Sanchez was pronounced dead at the scene.

The off-duty officer, who has been with the department for three years and seven months, was not hurt during the incident. Police are withholding the officer's name because there are outstanding assailants connected to the case.

A review of the officer-involved shooting will be conducted by the LAPD Force Investigation Division, as well as the police chief, the Office of the Inspector General and Board of Police Commissioners and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, officials said.
