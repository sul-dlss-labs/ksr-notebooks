State troopers are looking into a deadly head Thursday evening collision in Mobile County involving a sheriff's deputy. Two people were killed in the accident, and the deputy sheriff, 31 year old Randall Dueitt, was treated and released for his injuries. Troopers aren't sure what caused the accident, but it was raining when it happened. 27 year old Paul Caine and 22 year old Sonia Caine died in the crash.

Dueitt was taken to the University of South Alabama Medical Center, where he was listed in fair condition. A state troopers spokesman says the deputy was responding to a call, but had not engaged his emergency siren or lights.
