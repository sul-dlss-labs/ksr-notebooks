Sambuunyam had reportedly gone to the Sleepy Hollow residence of the sister of a woman with whom he once had a relationship. The ex-girlfriend was not at the residence, but Sambuunyam reportedly attacked the sister, who was injured but recovered.

Called to the home near Maple Lane and Hemlock Drive, police shot Sambuunyam when he approached them holding a knife, McMahon said.
