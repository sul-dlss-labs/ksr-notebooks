Marshfield Community Television is looking for Marshfield veterans to participate in the Marshfield Veterans History Project, launching this year.

Based off the template used by the Library of Congress for their Veterans History Project, the Marshfield Project will have veterans coming to MCTV to be interviewed about their service.

These interviews record important parts of history told by those who have served our country. These interviews will also serve as way of honoring veterans, said Jonathan Grabowski, MCTV's executive director.

Interviews will later air on MCTV’s Public Channel (Comcast 13/Verizon 34 and will be later posted to MCTV’s Vimeo page and the Mass Media Exchange. Veteran’s interested in participating are asked to contact Grabowski at 781-837-4384 or email jgrabowski@marshfieldtv.org.
