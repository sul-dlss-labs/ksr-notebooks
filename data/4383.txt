Six hours of negotiations end in suicide Published 12:00 am Sunday, July 17, 2005

NATCHEZ &045;&045; Six hours of hopeful negotiations came up short for Adams County Sheriff’s deputies Friday morning when a domestic violence call ended in suicide.

Deputies responded to 5 Carriage Lane at around 5 a.m. after a 911 hang-up call. Shortly after the call, a female who had been assaulted by her husband called an ambulance from her next-door neighbor’s house.

When authorities arrived, Reggie Marvel, 35, barricaded himself in his house with a shotgun and threatened to kill himself, Sheriff Ronny Brown said.

Officers and family members negotiated with Marvel through an open bedroom window for six hours. At 11:20 a.m. Marvel shot himself one time, killing himself.

He was pronounced dead by Adams County Coroner James Lee, and his body will be transported to Jackson for a routine autopsy.

His wife was treated and released from the hospital. She had trauma to her head and upper body, Brown said.

When she left her home for the neighbor’s house she carried a 4-year-old daughter with her, but the child was not injured, Brown said.

Brown said four of his officers witnessed the suicide and were shaken by the incident.

&uot;We thought we had talked him out of it,&uot; he said. &uot;We brought him tobacco that he wanted and a cell phone and he talked to family. We were preparing to go in.&uot;

No officers were injured in the incident.

Carriage Lane is in the Beau Pre subdivision.
