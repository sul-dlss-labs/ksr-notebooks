Police say a man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in north Phoenix Sunday afternoon.

Police were called to a home in the area of Cave Creek Road and Tatum Boulevard after receiving reports of a domestic disturbance involving a man who was breaking things inside the house, officials told ABC15.

When officers arrived at the scene, 47-year-old Nicholas Johnston was standing in the front yard holding a rifle, officials said. The suspect allegedly pointed the gun at a helicopter and fired a shot into the air.

When Johnston spotted the officers walking towards him he pointed the rifle at them, officials said. A 45-year-old officer with 22 years of police experience fired two rounds and fatally wounded the man.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene, a police spokesperson said.

According to authorities, Johnston's mother had called 911 because he started acting aggressively after drinking all morning. She was able to get out of the house unharmed.

Nearby homes were evacuated as a result of the incident, a Phoenix Police spokesperson said. However, residents have since been allowed to return home.

No officers were injured during the incident.

Monday, authorities confirmed Johnston served three months in prison stemming from an aggravated DUI in December 2011.
