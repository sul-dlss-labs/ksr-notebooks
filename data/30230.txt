After Louisiana State Police pursued a reportedly stolen vehicle and then backed off, the SUV ran off the road, killing an Abbeville teen and injuring three others.

A trooper noticed a Ford Explorer at about 2 a.m. Monday that was northbound at a high rate of speed on U.S. Highway 167. The trooper tried to pull the car over but the driver kept going, according to a release from spokesperson Trooper First Class Thomas Gossen.

A chase ensued, but the trooper ended the pursuit because of inclement weather and unsafe speeds, Gossen said. The trooper later discovered the Explorer had run off the road, hit a parked car, overturned and crashed into a utility pole, Gossen said.

Four of the Explorer's passengers, who were all juveniles, were not wearing seatbelts. Trashawn Harrison, 15, of Abbeville, was ejected and died from his injuries. The other three passengers were taken to a local hospital with moderate injuries.

The suspected driver of the SUV, who also is a juvenile, ran from the scene.

The Explorer had been reported stolen from Abbeville hours before the crash, which remains under investigation, Gossen said.
