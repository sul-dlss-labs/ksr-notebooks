Defendant pleaded guilty to one count of attempted first-degree murder and was sentenced to the maximum term of twenty-five years imprisonment. The Supreme Court affirmed, holding (1) Defendant’s sentence, which was not grossly disproportionate to Defendant’s crime, fell within the constitutional prescriptions of the Eighth Amendment; (2) the inclusion of the federal presentence investigation report in the state presentence investigation report did not violate Defendant’s due process rights; and (3) Defendant was not improperly denied counsel during his interview with court services, as Defendant did not have a Sixth Amendment right to have counsel present at the interview.
