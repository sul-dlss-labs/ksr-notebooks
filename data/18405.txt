A 31-year-old man allegedly armed with two guns was fatally shot by police in a confrontation Monday night in North Philadelphia.

The man, whose name was not released but whose last known address was in Huntingdon, Pa., was a suspect in the shooting of a 44-year-old man in North Philadelphia late Monday afternoon, Chief Inspector Scott Small said.

Around 5:40 p.m., the older man drove himself to Temple University Hospital with gunshot wounds to his back. He was reported in stable condition.

The man told police the shooting occurred in the 700 block of West Clearfield Street while he was washing his car. He also said his shooter could be found in the 3100 block of Darien Street.

Between 6:30 and 7 p.m., 25th District officers were searching the area around Darien when someone pointed out the suspect. The suspect started running, with officers in pursuit.

"He pulls a gun from his waistband pocket area," Small said.

In the 3100 block of North Ninth Street, police ordered the suspect to drop the gun, and he refused, Small said. Two sergeants and two officers in uniform opened fire, striking the suspect, who fell to the ground.

"They clearly see he drops two guns," Small said.

The suspect crawled to one of the guns, grabbed it, and raised it toward police, Small said. He was again ordered to drop the firearm, and he again refused. Police again fired at him, Small said.

The confrontation occurred just after 7 p.m.

The suspect was taken to Temple University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:18. The two guns were a semiautomatic and a revolver, Small said. Both were loaded.

"What he was doing in this area, we don't know," Small said.

On Clearfield, police could find no evidence of the earlier shooting.
