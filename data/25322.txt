SPRINGFIELD — Authorities are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting after a Bay County man approached officers with a knife in hand, according to official reports.

David MacAdams, 56, was fatally shot Thursday night outside his home by police. Springfield Police Department reported responding about 9:30 p.m. to a domestic issue at 2720 Altha Ave. when MacAdams approached Springfield Investigator Robert Gay with a knife. When Gay’s efforts failed to get MacAdams to put down the knife, Gay opened fire. MacAdams later died at a local hospital.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) is investigating the shooting.

Chief Barry Roberts declined to comment on most of the incident, pending FDLE’s investigation, but said his officer felt he was in danger at the time of the shooting.

“All I can say is that (the officer) told him several times to drop the weapon,” Roberts said. “Instead, he continued to advance toward the officer to the point he felt he was in danger.”

Roberts said he was not sure how many shots had been fired. When he arrived, EMTs were performing CPR on MacAdams, and the investigation was turned over for independent review by FDLE, Roberts said.

Neighbors and family members of MacAdams, though, recalled hearing as many as six shots fired by the officer.

His wife, Georgia MacAdams, stood over a blood stain Friday afternoon in the road in front of her light blue trailer as she recalled the events of the night. She said she could still hear the multiple gunshots from the officer that ended her husband’s life. Georgia MacAdams said she regrets calling the police and that they overreacted by opening fire.

“I really think they could’ve handled the situation better,” she said. “They didn’t have to shoot him. They could’ve tried talking him down.”

MacAdams said two of their grandchildren were staying the night with them. At some point in the night, either a medical issue or medication or a combination of the two caused her husband to suddenly turn violent and place a gun to his own head. She then called 911 for help.

When police arrived, David MacAdams had discarded the gun somewhere, Georgia MacAdams said, and retrieved a knife. He then walked out to where the officer was stationed in the road, brandishing the knife, Georgia MacAdams said.

Georgia MacAdams said officers did tell her husband multiple times to put his hands up before opening fire. But they were shouting the commands instead of trying to defuse the situation, she said.

“They didn’t give him a chance,” Georgia MacAdams said. “He was just disturbed. I know people are on edge because of the storm, but they didn’t have to kill him.”

She added that David MacAdams had several medical issues, and they had plans to visit another of their grandchildren in New Orleans this weekend for the Christmas holiday.

One neighbor, who declined to be identified, recalled hearing multiple gunshots coming from a trailer a few houses down and first thought it was someone banging on her door. By the time she went outside, her neighbor was lying in the road with police cars all around. She said it was startling for something of the sort to take place in the typically quiet neighborhood.

“We never have police here,” she said. “Everybody’s generally nice.”

Roberts said no other injuries were reported in the incident. Gay will be on administrative leave as FDLE’s investigation proceeds. Depending on the outcome of the investigation, he would have to be cleared by mental health experts to return to service.
