A Fulton County Districtâ€™s Attorney spokeswoman on Friday said a 15-year-old facing a murder charge in connection to a fatal car crash will be charged as an adult.

Quindarius Boddie is accused of killing a woman in a south Fulton County crash Saturday while trying to elude police in a stolen car.

The woman, 29-year-old Tiffany Madison, was a passenger in a Ford Mustang when the stolen Dodge Neon allegedly driven by the teen ran a red light on Delowe Drive at 3 p.m. Saturday and slammed into the Mustang, according to Channel 2 Action News.

Atlanta police said the officer spotted the stolen vehicle just minutes before near Alison Court in southwest Atlanta. The officer tried to stop the vehicle, but it fled and crashed a short distance away, police said.

In all, five people were taken to the hospital with injuries, including those in a third vehicle that was struck, according to Channel 2.

The Georgia State Patrol has also charged Boddie with driving under the influence, failure to obey traffic control devices, theft by receiving, fleeing or attempting to elude, reckless driving, driving while unlicensed, passing in a no passing zone, serious injury by vehicle, and a seat belt violation.
