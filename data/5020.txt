SUMMIT â€” Illinois State Police and the Cook County state's attorney's office on Friday were investigating the fatal shooting of a 21-year-old Bolingbrook man by Summit police a day earlier in the southwest suburb.

Paris C. Nicholson, of the 0-100 block of Fernwood Drive, was pronounced dead at Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood Thursday night, about 45 minutes after he was shot, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Police said in a press release that officers responded to a call of a disturbance about 6:10 p.m. near 74th Avenue and 63rd Street. There they found several young people apparently involved in a fight among rival street gangs, police said.

The first officer on the scene heard a gunshot and saw Nicholson with a weapon. When the officer left his squad car, Nicholson fled on foot, police said.

The officer chased him for about a block, then, fearing for his life, fired two shots, according to a police news release. Summit police would not answer questions about why the officer was in fear for his life. But at least one bullet struck Nicholson in the upper front torso, police said. Nicholson was taken by ambulance to the hospital, police added.

"The offender's loaded gun was recovered at the scene," Summit Police Lt. Michael Long said.

No one else was injured during the incident, Long added.
