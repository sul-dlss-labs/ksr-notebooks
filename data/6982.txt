Sergio Jose Rojas, 21, a Latino man, was shot multiple times in an officer-involved shooting at the Ramona Gardens Housing Development in Boyle Heights about 6 p.m. Wednesday, March 12.

According to police, Officers Jose Alfaro and Jacob Avalos with LAPD's Community Law Enforcement and Recovery unit were patrolling the area on foot when they responded to a radio call of a suspect on a bicycle refusing to be detained.

The officers hid behind some buildings and attempted to apprehend Rojas as he approached their location. Police said Rojas abandoned his bicycle, pulled out a small-caliber pistol and led the officers on a foot pursuit.

Rojas then allegedly pointed the pistol at the officers as he was running. The officers fired several shots, striking Rojas multiple times. He was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Police said a chrome .25-caliber semi-automatic pistol was recovered at the scene. The shooting is being investigated by LAPD's Force Investigation Division.
