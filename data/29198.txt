A 25-year-old passenger died and the driver was arrested after a car struck a Santa Ana police SUV with two officers inside Friday night, Nov. 20, the Santa Ana Police Department said.

The officers were in some pain, so they were taken to a hospital as a precaution, Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said.

The crash happened as officers were investigating a report of trespassing at 1300 N. Lowell St. about 10:35 p.m. As officers were preparing to leave, a car traveling eastbound crashed head-on into the parked patrol car, Bertagna said.

A passenger in the Honda was taken to Orange County Global Medical Center, where she died, Bertagna said. She was identified as Selina Resendiz Yanez, 25, of Santa Ana, Orange County Deputy Coroner Kelley Keyes said.

The driver, who police identified as Jesus Emmanuel Perez of Santa Ana, was arrested on suspicion of felony vehicular manslaughter while driving under the influence.
