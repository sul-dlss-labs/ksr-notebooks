DENISON, Texas (KXII) -- A police chase in Denison ended in a wreck on Sunday night, leaving one man dead.

Carl and Judson Duncan, of Antlers, Oklahoma, were in their car in the parking lot of the Holiday Inn Express in Denison Sunday night when the cops were called. They were not guests of the hotel.

"One of the officers went back to his patrol vehicle and did a routine check like we do on people, and while he was there the vehicle took off," said Lt. Mike Eppler with Denison Police.

The car fled north on U.S. Highway 75 reaching speeds over 100 miles per hour. The father and son crashed about six miles later at exit 72 near State Highway 91.

"He veered across the road and went into a barrier," Eppler said. "It is still under investigation, but there is evidence suggesting it might not have been an accident."

Judson, 21, was the passenger and pronounced dead on scene. His 50-year-old father, Carl, was flown to a Plano hospital and is expected to recover. Police say neither men were wearing a seat belt

"It's just dangerous to get out there and drive that fast," said Oklahoma resident George Meserole.

Meserole lives just north of the Red River, a few miles from the crash site.

"Putting everyone's lives in the danger especially if police are in pursuit they're driving just as fast, so it's just kind of silly to do that," Meserole said.

"We don't like anyone to take off in vehicles no matter what the reason is because it not only endangers them and the officer, but the public to," Eppler said.

Police say it's early in their investigation and they're still trying to figure out why they were at the hotel, and what led to the crash.

"Following up on leads to what might have, you know could have transpired," Eppler told News 12.

No one else was hurt in the chase. Denison police will turn their findings over to the District Attorney's Office to see what charges, if any, will be filed.
