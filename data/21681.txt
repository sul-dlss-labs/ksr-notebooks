The Winnebago County District Attorney says officers were justified in their use of deadly force against 28-year-old Isaiah Tucker.

The DA's findings are based on an investigation conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation.

District Attorney Christian Gossett says on July 31, officers responded to a report that someone was trying to steal a car from a garage in the area of W. 4 Ave and Knapp St.

Body cam video shows Officer Kyle Roberts entering the garage. Roberts yells, "Isaiah, hands up!" and repeats commands to get out of the car. Tucker ignores the commands. Roberts holsters his weapon.

The video shows Tucker crash through a partially open garage door and nearly hit Officer Aaron Achterberg, who was trying to help Officer Roberts. Officer Achterberg yelled, "You're gonna get shot!" as the car backs into the yard.

Officer Roberts used a baton to try to get Tucker to stop. The car backed up and hit a tree. The car turned toward Achterberg, and he fired his weapon.

The DA says the officers fired 11 shots in four seconds. The entire incident lasts about two minutes.

Tucker drove away from the scene on Knapp St. A short time later, Oshkosh officers found Tucker in a shed, suffering from gunshots to the leg and shoulder. The report indicates officers attempted to provide aid, but he died on the way to the hospital.

An autopsy was conducted at the Wisconsin Anatomic Pathology Lab. The autopsy found Tucker died of "firearm injury sustained during an engagement with law enforcement."

DCI collected body cams from both officers, a car, shell casings, a police duty pistol, dried blood, a cell phone, money, clothing, personal effects, biological specimens, DNA evidence, documents, recordings, and all other evidence.

Officers Achterberg and Roberts were placed on paid administrative leave after the shooting. Police Chief Dean Smith says the officers are still on leave, but they will be reintegrated into the department.

"Currently the officers are still on paid administrative leave. We anticipate at some point changing that status, but we do have some steps we want to take along the way to ensure the officers are reintegrated back into the department and their activities in a manner that's going to help them through this process,"

Smith says the officers are doing "OK."

"This is a terrible situation, as I mentioned before. This is a tragedy for both Mr. Tucker's family, for the officers, for the department, as well as the community.

Gossett said in trying to explain Tucker's actions, Tucker was described as acting more aggressively recently, knew he had a warrant for his arrest, and had drugs in his system when he died, including amphetamines, methamphetamine, cocaine, morphine, norfentanyl and others. Gossett says the presence of morphine and norfentanyl suggests heroin use.
