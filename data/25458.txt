A Tulsa County deputy shot and killed a man late Wednesday after responding to a domestic disturbance call in northern Tulsa County, officials said.

The incident was prompted by a call just after 10 p.m. Wednesday; a woman told dispatchers she was awakened by an acquaintance standing over her bed with a weapon, sheriff’s spokeswoman Casey Roebuck said. The woman reportedly had a protective order against the man, identified early Thursday as 57-year-old Terry Lee Cockrell.

Upon reaching the house in the 7600 block of North Madison Avenue, deputies found signs of forced entry with scuff marks on and near the door, Roebuck said, adding that the house reportedly had a history of domestic violence calls.

Deputy Mic Bonin found Cockrell hiding in the backyard, according to a TCSO news release. He ignored commands to stop and fled into a wooded area near the home. Bonin deployed his Taser, but it was unsuccessful because the probes weren’t able to penetrate the man’s coat.

Deputies gave chase, then commanded him to stop and show his hands, Roebuck said. Cockrell stated a gun was in his pocket and that he wanted the deputy to shoot him.

When Cockrell reached toward his pocket, Bonin shot him, killing the man.

Bonin, hired by TCSO in 2005, has been placed on paid administrative leave pending an investigation, Roebuck said.
