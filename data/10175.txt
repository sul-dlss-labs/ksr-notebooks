Then he was suspected of stealing $500,000 in cash and watches from a jewelry store at the Trump Taj Mahal hotel in Atlantic City on Thursday night, federal agents said.

A task force of the F.B.I., the New York City Police Department and United States marshals went to the Hampshire after receiving a telephone call saying that Mr. Mansoor was staying at the hotel, which is between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue.

Three members of the task force -- an F.B.I. agent, a city police officer and a deputy United States marshal -- arrived at the hotel around 9:30 a.m. The three questioned managers in the lobby, apparently unaware that Mr. Mansoor was there, too, among the tourists and staffers. The fugitive noticed his pursuers and started to run, officials said, but it quickly became clear that he could not escape in the narrow, crowded space. Mr. Mansoor pulled out a handgun, but he was shot twice in the stomach before he was able to fire, the authorities said. One law enforcement official said it was the F.B.I. agent who fired.

''He was down in the lobby when he was confronted by the officers, leading to a struggle,'' Barry W. Mawn, the assistant director in charge of the New York field office of the F.B.I., told reporters at the hotel. ''He went for a gun and he was shot.''

Mr. Mawn said the three task force members involved in the shooting, none of whom were identified, were taken to St. Vincent for evaluation. The New York City police were leading an inquiry into the shooting, Mr. Mawn said.
