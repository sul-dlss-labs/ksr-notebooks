PENINSULA, Ohio -- The Summit County Medical Examiner's Office identified the man who killed himself last week with a police officer's gun following a fight with the officer at a Peninsula golf course, authorities said.

Ryan Yesberger, 24, of Naples, Florida, died from a single gunshot to the head last week at the Brandywine County Club in the 5000 block of Akron-Peninsula Road, the Medical Examiner's Office reported.

The Medical Examiner's Office gave Yesberger's address as Naples, Florida. An online obituary identifies a man with the same name and age as Yesberger's as the owner and operator of the Brandywine County Club.

The Ohio Secretary of State's website lists BDB Agent Company in Akron as the main agent and registrant of the golf course. The website names Brett Yesberger as the country club's previous agent.

Peninsula police were called about 5:15 a.m. on Wednesday to investigate a report of property damage at the the golf course. An officer spotted Yesberger on the property and the two got into a struggle, the Summit County Sheriff's Office has reported.

Yesberger hit the officer in the head and knocked him to the ground, the sheriff's office said. The officer was semi-conscious on the ground when Yesberger took the officer's gun from his holster, authorities said.

A golf course employee witnessed the encounter and tried to the help the officer, but Yesberger ran away, officials said.

A gunshot was heard a short time later, the sheriff's office said. The officer radioed for help and set up caution tape. Yesberger was found dead at the golf course.
