Summerville, S.C. | A Dorchester County deputy once named South Carolina deputy of the year and his police dog will be buried together this week.

Sheriff's Cpl. Mike Deese, 38, was killed on patrol around 5:20 p.m. Friday when an eastbound pickup truck crossed the median of I-26 near the Harleyville exit and slammed into his cruiser, authorities said.

Deese and the driver of the pickup, 53-year-old Christopher Burnham Jr. of Summerville, both died instantly, Coroner Chris Nisbet said.

Deese's patrol dog, Sonja, was in the back of his cruiser and also died, Nisbet said.

Three other vehicles were involved in Friday's wreck, but no one in the other cars were seriously injured, authorities said.

Deese's funeral was scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at Faith Assembly Church in Summerville, with the burial the next day. Deese and Sonja will be buried in the same coffin.
