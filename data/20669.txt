One man is dead after a wild shootout in North Philadelphia Monday night, according to authorities.

Around 11 p.m., 25th District Police officers were on patrol when they say they spotted a gunman firing shots at another man while riding a BMX bike.

The incident occurred at the Hess Gas Station on 5th and Lehigh.

“The police observed this and ordered the male to stop shooting and drop his weapon,” said Chief Inspector Scott Small of the Philadelphia police.

“The male refused and continued to fire his weapon at the other male.”

That’s when police say they took action, firing several shots at the gunman and striking him twice in the torso.

The suspect was taken to Temple Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:11 a.m.

Amazingly, neither police nor the man who was allegedly fired upon were injured.

“The male who was being fired at as well as the police officers were very, very fortunate,” said Chief Inspector Small.

“They were all in very close proximity when this gunfire was taking place.”

At this time, police have not identified the man who was killed and they haven’t released any details as to why he was firing shots in the first place.

The incident was the latest shooting in a wave of gun violence that has hit the area since Friday. Authorities say that over the weekend, there were more than 20 shootings in Philadelphia, with six people dead and dozens others injured.
