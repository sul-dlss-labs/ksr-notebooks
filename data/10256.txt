Authorities believe a man who was shot and killed while attempting to run down officers in San Francisco on Tuesday is the same man who robbed two Irvine banks.

Officers were attempting to arrest Joshua Camden Smith, 25, just before 5:30 p.m. on Buena Vista Avenue East near Height Street when they say he tried to run them over with a stolen BMW, San Francisco Police Sgt. Michael Andraychak said.

Smith is suspected of being the bank robber authorities have named the “Gen X bandit,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said. The Gen X bandit earned his moniker because of the plaid shirt and wool cap he was wearing during the May 17 robberies, as well as his young age, authorities said.

The Gen X bandit robbed a Chase Bank on Quail Hill in Irvine at about 11 a.m., authorities said. About 20 minutes later, the same man robbed a second bank at 6540 Irvine Center Drive.

Shortly after the robberies, the Gen X bandit led authorities on a high-speed pursuit and was able to get away, said Special Agent Chris Gicking with the FBI.

The man is also believed to have fled from authorities in two additional instances.

FBI officials believed the Gen X bandit was driving a stolen BMW and asked the company to tap into its GPS system to locate the vehicle.

The FBI informed San Francisco police that the BMW was in their city, Andraychak said.

Officers began surveillance of the vehicle, and on Tuesday afternoon attempted to stop and arrest Smith when it appeared that he was going to drive away, Andraychak said.

Smith allegedly tried to run over at least one officer, at which point several officers reportedly opened fired at him. He was taken to a hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.
