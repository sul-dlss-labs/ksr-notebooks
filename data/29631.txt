HAYSI, Va. (WJHL) – Authorities have identified the victim and suspected shooter in a murder-suicide Monday morning in Dickenson County.

The Dickenson County Sheriff’s Office says Jonathan O’quin, 30, entered Hillcom Inc. in Haysi and fired multiple rounds, killing Kenny Hill, 45, who was shot multiple times while in his apartment above the business.

Workers told deputies they heard the gunshots and saw O’quin leave in a burgundy pickup truck.

Sheriff Jeremy Fleming said a deputy pursued O’quin for about three miles before the suspect turned onto Bartlick Road.

Fleming said the O’quin stopped and got out of the vehicle on Bartlick Bridge and fired multiple rounds at the pursuing deputy. The deputy returned fire but did not hit the suspect, according to Fleming.

According to Fleming, O’quin then shot himself in the head with a high-powered rifle.

The deputy was not injured during the shooting.

“Mr. O’quin and his wife have been separated. It appears O’quin was upset because his wife did not answer his phone call earlier in the day. He came to the apartment and entered without knocking. He used a 380 handgun to shoot Mr. Hill,” the sheriff’s office said in a release.

The Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigations is handling the investigation.
