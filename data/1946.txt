The police union says it will fight Mayor Alan Autry’s plan to hire an independent auditor to investigate officer-related shootings and complaints from the public.

“The proposal is being perceived by our membership as one more person looking over an officer’s shoulder,” said Sgt. Mike Oliver of the Fresno Police Officers Assn. “The fact is we do a terrific job of policing ourselves.”

Last week, Autry announced his plan two days after an officer shot and killed Lydia “Tammy” Rodriguez, 32, at a car dealership. Witnesses said Rodriguez had been waving a hatchet at the officer.
