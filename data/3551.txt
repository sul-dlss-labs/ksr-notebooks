One motorist was killed and another was injured in Lamar County when their automobile wrecked after they tried to elude Highway Patrolmen in a brief, high-speed chase late last evening. The Highway Patrol hasn't released all the details yet, but they say one passenger died when he was ejected from the car as it wrecked on Highway 98 around 11:30. Another male passenger was also injured, but the driver was not hurt. According to patrolmen, shortly before the accident, the car had been clocked at a high rate of speed by two state troopers, who chased it for a few miles before the driver lost control in a curve and wrecked. Officers are still investigating the incident and will meet with the district attorney to see what charges will be filed.
