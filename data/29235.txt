CLIFTON, NJ — The Attorney General’s Office has released security camera footage from an Oct. 22 accident in which a police officer struck and killed a 65-year-old woman with his vehicle in Clifton.

The recording includes limited video taken from a security camera near where the accident occurred.

This investigation dates back to Oct. 22, when Clifton Police Officer Garrell Middleton "was responding to a radio alert of a crime in progress with the emergency lights on his patrol vehicle activated" when he struck a pedestrian at the intersection of Allwood Road and Brookwood Road.

Middleton provided medical aid to the victim, the AG's Office said, and emergency medical personnel transported her to St. Joseph’s University Medical Center in Paterson, where she was pronounced dead at 7:42 p.m.
