WATKINS, Iowa – A Cedar Rapids man died when he crashed into a tree while he was being pursued by police.

The chase reportedly began when a Linn County Sheriff’s deputy tried to pull over a 2013 Chevrolet Cruze for an alleged traffic violation, south of Palo just after 3:30 p.m. Monday, April 11, 2016.

Instead of pulling over, 32-year-old David Aaron Janish kept going; he allegedly led police on gravel and paved roads in Linn and Benton counties for about 15 minutes until he lost control and ran into a tree while he was southbound on 26th Avenue, according to the Iowa State Patrol crash report.

Janish and one of his passengers, a 36-year-old man from Cedar Rapids, were each wearing seat belts at the time of the crash. Janish was killed in the wreck; the male passenger was taken by ambulance to a hospital for treatment of his injuries.
