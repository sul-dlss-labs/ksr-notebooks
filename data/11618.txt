Crime & Safety Man Dies After Shootout With Clearwater Police Julius Richard Larrance, 19, opened fire on patrolling officers at Palmetto Park Apartments and was later found dead inside a unit Wednesday afternoon, according to police. Reply

Carolyn Butler was shook up Wednesday.

After taking the morning to care for her elderly mother with dementia, she got an unforgettable phone call. She said it was her nephew, Julius Richard Larrance, who opened fire on two Clearwater Police officers with a handgun leading to a foot chase near the Palmetto Park Apartments and at least one officer returned fire, striking him around 1:30 p.m., according to Clearwater Police.

"I don't know how it started off," Butler said as tears started to stream down her face. "He ran and the police shot and killed him." Butler said she and her mother raised Larrance from a baby. Butler said his parents had died.

Larrance, 19, fled when officers Karl Wassmer and Lauren Josey approached him, believing he might be a wanted suspect, spokeswoman Elizabeth Watts said in a media release. Larrance opened fire and Wassmer, 46, returned it, striking him. After a chase through the complex, Larrance barricaded himself inside an apartment, Watts said.

A resident and two children were in the apartment when Larrance went in through the unlocked front door, according to Watts. The resident quickly left with the children through the back of the apartment. Responding officers tried to make contact with Larrance and later entered the apartment to find him lying on the floor with a handgun near his hand.
