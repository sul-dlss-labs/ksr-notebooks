OREM — Officials identified a man who died Thursday after being ejected from his vehicle in a “serious crash” while traveling south on I-15 in Orem.

Troopers received reports of a reckless driver, later identified as Salt Lake City resident John R. Homer, 60, and stationed their vehicles to intervene shortly before 11 a.m., according to Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Todd Royce. Homer lost control of his Hyundai Sante Fe, and the car hit the right concrete wall and started to roll near 800 North.

Homer was ejected from the vehicle and landed in the far right exit only lane, according to a statement on the agency’s website. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Sante Fe continued traveling approximately 300 feet south down the road and came to a rest against the left concrete barrier, UHP officials said.

It is unknown whether Homer was wearing a seat belt at the time of the crash, officials said.

Troopers closed the freeway near the 1600 North exit shortly after 11 a.m., according to Utah Department of Transportation officials. The freeway reopened about 1:30 p.m., according to the KSL Traffic Center.
