Authorities in east Alabama are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting after a man allegedly pulled a gun on Cleburne County sheriff’s deputies after shooting a man in the chest, according to a report.

Cleburne County sheriff’s deputies were called to Cleburne County Road 33 and U.S. 78 in Fruithurst around 2:46 p.m. Monday when they found a man shot in the chest, the Anniston Star reported Tuesday.

The victim and another witness identified the suspect to sheriff’s deputies, who found the suspect in another area of Fruithurst.

That’s when the suspect got out of a car and brandished a handgun at sheriff’s deputies. The deputies then fired at the suspect, killing him.

The Oxford Police Department and the Center for Applied Forensics in Jacksonville are investigating the fatal shooting.
