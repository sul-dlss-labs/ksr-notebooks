The Texas Rangers are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting after a pursuit in Cochran County ended in gunfire on Wednesday.

At approximately 4:16 p.m., a Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper, along with a DPS special agent, attempted to stop a 2006 Chevrolet pickup in Levelland for a traffic violation, said DPS LT. Bryan Witt.

The vehicle reportedly refused to stop, and the driver, later identified as 40-year-old Leonardo Gallegos Jr. of Muleshoe, evaded law enforcement with his vehicle, according to DPS.

Troopers continued to attempt to stop the vehicle by deploying tire deflation systems, or spikes, said Witt.

The vehicle was eventually spiked and continued to evade law enforcement into a field northwest of Whiteface, according to initial reports.

The driver reportedly shot at law enforcement, forcing them to return gunfire, said Witt.

Gallegos was injured during the shooting and was pronounced dead at the scene, according to officials.

Witt said Gallegos had active warrants at the time of the incident, including possession of a controlled substance out of Reagan County and failure to register as a sex offender out of Muleshoe Police Department.

The DPS Aircraft Division, as well as the Hockley County Sheriff's Office assisted during the incident.

The case remained under investigation by the Texas Rangers Thursday.
