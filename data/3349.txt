INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A car fleeing from police officers on the first night of a neighborhood crackdown struck another vehicle, killing its 75-year-old driver.

The car officers were pursuing Monday night drove through a red light on the city's near northside, smashing into a car driven by Earl T. Jamison and throwing both cars onto the sidewalk near the intersection.

The driver of the fleeing car, 29-year-old Warren Collins Jr., then backed the car into a Foot Locker shoe store, breaking a large window, before he ran from the scene, police said. Collins, whose driver's license was suspended, was arrested nearby.

Jamison was taken to Wishard Memorial Hospital, where he was declared dead.

The chase came as Indianapolis police began a new crime-fighting campaign including increased patrols aimed at stopping minor crimes from escalating into violence.

Police said the chase began when officers tried to stop the car driven by Collins after it failed to signal for a turn.
