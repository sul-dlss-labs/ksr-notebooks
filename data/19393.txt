UNION TOWNSHIP (KDKA) - A 91-year-old man is dead after a standoff in Lawrence County ended with a police-involved shooting.

Police were called to the home on Spring Street in Union Township after a woman said her uncle fired a shot at her.

After a more than three-and-a-half hour standoff, police say Frank Wratny confronted New Castle Police with a gun from the front door.

Officers shot Wratny and he died at the scene. Neighbors watched as the horrific scene played out.

"We saw him, the older man with a shotgun, and he put it out the door and he was shooting and they charged in and they had to shoot him," Vision Davidson said.

One person told KDKA Wratny had medical problems, including poor vision and dementia.

"He was a good man. He was a great guy. It was a bad day," neighbor Darin Lane said. "I'm 45 years old and living here all of my life, known him all of my life, good people hate to see this situation, he was a good man."

State police are handling the investigation.
