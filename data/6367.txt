COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - WIS News 10 has learned the parents of a Columbia man shot to death last month have hired an attorney and they are planning to file a wrongful death lawsuit.

Richard Lewis Catoe, Junior, often known as Ricky, died after a standoff with Columbia police and Richland County Sheriff's deputies. Catoe had set fire to his house twice, and had been shot and wounded by a Columbia police officer.

Police tried negotiating with Catoe. They tried hitting him with bean bags from a shotgun. Eventually, a sheriff's deputy shot and killed Catoe, who was armed with a knife.

His stepfather says Catoe was "shot like a dog," and says both agencies bear responsibility.

Charles and Phyllis Johnson and members of the Samson Circle community met with Sheriff Leon Lott last weekend. Now the Johnson's want answers from Columbia Chief Dean Crisp.

Crisp was in charge of the response to Catoe's actions. He made the call to bring in the SWAT team, and multiple sources say that decision continues to be heavily criticized in the law enforcement community.

Crisp has also been under fire for bringing his son, Adam, to Samson Circle and allowing him close to the shooting scene. That issue helped launch a review of Columbia police operations.

And the review is likely to include another matter. We've learned Crisp has been named in a complaint filed in May by one of his officers. City manager Charles Austin says that officer claims Crisp made physical contact with him on two occasions. Austin characterizes both situations as an "invasion" of the officer's personal space.

The complaint has been turned over to a labor attorney.

Austin expects to name a three member panel early next week. That panel will conduct the police department review.
