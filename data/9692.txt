The Clark County Coroner's Office has identified a man who died after Metro Police officers used a Taser to subdue him Saturday morning.

Anthony Jones, 44, of Las Vegas, died after being taken to Valley Hospital. The coroner hasn't determined the cause or manner of death.

Police said an officer performed a traffic stop at 1:07 a.m. Saturday near the 1000 block of West Lake Mead Boulevard, near Martin L. King Boulevard in west Las Vegas.

While the officer was speaking to Jones, who was the only occupant, he tried to flee on foot, police said. Jones ran north across Lake Mead and jumped over a wall into the backyard of an abandoned home in the 1000 block of Hart Avenue.

The officer followed Jones into the backyard as other officers arrived. The officers tried to take the man into custody, but he “aggressively resist(ed) the officers,” police said in a statement.

The officers used a Taser on Jones several times, police said. Jones was taken into custody and then officers noticed he was in medical distress. The officers rendered aid to Jones and summoned medical assistance, police said.

Jones was taken to Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead after arriving, police said.

The officers involved in the incident have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such incidents. Police haven't said why the vehicle was stopped or why they believe Jones ran from the officer.
