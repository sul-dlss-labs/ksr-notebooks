A man died after he was shot by police officers following a chase Friday evening in southeast Tulsa.

Officers with the Fugitive Warrants Task Force attempted to serve multiple felony warrants on the man in the area of 61st Street and Memorial Drive, but when he saw the officers, he fled just after 5 p.m., Officer Demita Kinard said at the shooting scene.

Police on Saturday identified the man as 34-year-old David English of Claremore.

Police pursued him, and he apparently saw officers setting up traps for his car and turned into a shopping center parking lot on the west side of Mingo Road between 51st Street and 47th Place, Kinard said.

He got out of the car and “aggressed” toward officers with a knife, and three officers discharged their firearms, Kinard told reporters at the scene. Officers recovered the knife at the scene.

The man was in critical condition when he was taken to a hospital, according to police. He was pronounced dead at 6:07 p.m., police said.

The warrants on which the man was wanted included counts of rape, kidnapping and domestic violence, Kinard said.

A witness at the scene, Patty Hall, said she saw the shooting from inside a US Foods office at 4717 S. Mingo Road.

She had heard police sirens and looked outside to see a car stopped in front of several police vehicles in a parking lot directly across the street from her, she said. She said she saw a man get out of the car and start moving toward the officers and then heard three gunshots and saw him fall to the ground.

Friends and relatives told police the man was despondent about going back to jail and was suicidal, Kinard said.

The names the officers involved were not released as of Saturday morning. The officers have been placed on paid leave pending the results of the investigation.
