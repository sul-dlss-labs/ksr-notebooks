LYNN — On Friday, Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said three Lynn police officers shot and killed a man who pointed a gun at them off Western Avenue, following a morning pursuit.

Randolph McClain, 33 was shot by three Lynn police officers on the corner of Western Avenue and Nichols Avenue.

“Mr. McClain has been the subject of an ongoing investigation by the Lynn Police Department Domestic Violence Unit for multiple restraining order violations and threats,” said Blodgett.

Lynn Police Lt. Richard Donnelly said four Lynn police officers went to 106 Bay View Ave., off Western Avenue at 8:30 a.m. Friday to execute five outstanding arrest warrants on McClain, who was believed to be staying at that address.

“He has reportedly threatened his ex-girlfriend and her family with a gun, repeatedly, over the last three weeks. Lynn police had made it a priority to locate him due to the escalating threats,” said a police statement.

A 106 Bay View resident let the police into the residence. According to the statement, police called out to McClain as they checked the building’s second floor.

“He answered, saying that he had a gun and would kill them,” the statement said.

McClain, said the statement, fled the building onto a porch roof, pointed the gun at an officer and ran to the back of the house. He jumped to the ground and fled on foot. According to the statement, officers pursued him and “saw him approach a vehicle turning onto Nichols Avenue and ordered the female driver out of the vehicle at gunpoint.”

As officers approached the vehicle, the statement indicated McClain pointed his gun at officers and three officers fired their weapons at him. McClain was hit, and then transported to Salem Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The woman was not harmed.

Nichols Avenue resident Fatima Gonzalez had dropped her granddaughter off at school and was on her way home when she noticed police activity near her street and “saw a man running in-and-out of backyards.”

Gonzalez then saw a woman outside of a car with her hands up and a man inside the car. She heard shooting and managed to get inside her house where, she said, she saw shots fired right outside her kitchen window.

“I just saw the police shooting him. After the shooting, I saw his body slumped over and blood went on the street,” she said.

The area where the shooting occurred is a hilly neighborhood of mostly multi-family homes at the base of the Highlands, abutting Western Avenue.

Blodgett said that the names of the three officers involved would be released after they were interviewed by the State Police. A District Court records check indicated McLean had five pending warrants for his arrest and all were dated this month. His last listed address — for 2014 — was 70 Whiting St., Apt. 3.

During the investigation, which lasted through 5 p.m. Friday, responding officers cordoned off Western Avenue near Washington Street and down Western for several blocks. Bay View Avenue and Nichols Avenue are roughly 1,000 feet apart.

Area resident Jason Smith said he was woken by “about five shots.”

The three officers involved in the shooting will be on administrative leave while the investigation continues.
