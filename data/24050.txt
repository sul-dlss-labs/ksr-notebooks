Officers were called to the area at about 7:30 a.m. on a domestic call. The caller told dispatchers that a family member was being "assaultive" and had multiple knives.

Two police vehicles arrived on the scene -- one marked and one unmarked.

Lt. Josh Jones said Robert George Issa, 23, ran at the marked vehicle and tried gaining access to both vehicles. A Taser was deployed but was ineffective.

Police said Issa continued moving forward and refused to comply with commands. He was shot and taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Evidence markers were placed next to a knife and a Taser at the scene. A nearby vehicle was hit by several bullets.

No other arrests were made.

Authorities said Issa suffered from mental health issues and officers had been called to the home three times over the last year.

Troy police said it has been more than 20 years since an officer-involved shooting in the city.
