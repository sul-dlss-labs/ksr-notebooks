A home-invasion suspect in a stolen SUV – fleeing police at high speed – was fatally injured Monday when he crashed nearly head-on into a truck on U.S. 113 just south of Frankford, state police said.

Charles A. Campbell, 26, of Dagsboro, was taken to Atlantic General Hospital in Berlin, Maryland, where he was pronounced dead of multiple traumatic injuries, Master Cpl. Gary E. Fournier said.

The truck driver was not hurt.

Details of the alleged home invasion were not immediately available, but state police said the incident began shortly after 10 a.m.

Campbell – driving a stolen 2003 Ford Explorer – was being pursued by Dagsboro and Frankford police immediately after the home invasion in Dagsboro, Fournier said.

He was speeding on southbound U.S. 113 when he lost control of the SUV, drove over a concrete island, crossed the grass median and entered northbound lanes, he said.

Truck driver Brian J. Black, 42, of Harrington, northbound in a 2014 Mack 10-wheel box truck, tried to avoid Campbell's SUV, but the vehicles collided, Fournier said.

The SUV spun and overturned, rolling over several times, then landing on its roof in the median.

Campbell, not properly restrained, was ejected and landed in the median, Fournier said.

The box truck spun and slid, stopping across both northbound lanes. The driver, properly restrained, "was uninjured and refused treatment at the scene," Fournier said.

The crash remains under investigation by the Delaware State Police Collision Reconstruction Unit.

Northbound U.S. 113 was closed about four hours in the area of Cat Mans Road as the crash was investigated and cleared, Fournier said.
