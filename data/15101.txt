A man who was shot by Des Moines police after allegedly brandishing a knife at officers last week has died, police announced late Sunday.

Brian Lee Beeler, 41, died early Sunday morning at a Des Moines hospital.

Officers Peter Wilson and Cody Willis shot Beeler after an altercation in the 6700 block of Southeast Fifth Street about 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday.

Officers responded to a complaint about an argument at the home of Beeler's aunt. Police confronted Beeler, who had two knives in his waistband. Police said Beeler refused to show his hands and failed to follow officers' instructions to surrender.

Beeler advanced on officers. One officer tried to use a stun gun, but missed. Beeler brandished a knife and continued to move toward police. Both Wilson and Willis fired their handguns. Beeler was struck at least once in the torso, police said.

Wilson and Willis remain on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. The leave is standard procedure anytime an officer fires his weapon in the line of duty.

Beeler had been arrested 17 times since July 2008 on crimes ranging from drugs to trespassing and public intoxication.

The incident was third officer-involved shooting in Des Moines this year and the only fatality.
