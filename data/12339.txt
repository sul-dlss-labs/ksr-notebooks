Jakob Lange died Feb. 8, 2013, a day after he crashed into a tree while he was fleeing Fort Worth police officers. Lange's mother, Mary Deal of New Hampshire, alleges in a lawsuit that four police officers and their supervisor showed "reckless disregard" for her son's life during the police chase, court records show.

Officers in two patrol cars noticed Lange was speeding around 1:30 a.m. Feb. 7, 2013, shortly after he left a Fort Worth nightclub where he had performed. Court records allege that the officers didn't turn on their lights or sirens until Lange turned to drive the wrong direction on Granbury Road, a one-way street.

Police believe he was driving about 60 mph. Police records do not mention whether officers used a tire deflation device on Lange's car.

Lange continued driving and lost control of his car near the intersection of Overton Park Drive and Bellaire Drive. His car struck a tree. The University of North Texas graduate was transported to the hospital, where he died the next day.

Court records show that Lange's car had damage to the right front tire that appeared consistent with the use of spikes. Dash cam recordings show that no other cars were on the road at the time of the incident, the lawsuit says.

Officials with the Fort Worth Police Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.
