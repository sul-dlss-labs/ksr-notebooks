Pedro Santa Cruz, identified by the coroner's office as a 40-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, July 21, near E Street and McDonald Avenue in Wilmington, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

A patrol unit was called to investigate a prowler in the 500 block of McDonald Avenue shortly after midnight, according to an LAPD news release.

When officers arrived at the scene, they saw a man a block away, near E Street and McDonald Avenue, matching the description of the suspected prowler, police said.

As they approached the person, later identified as Pedro Santa Cruz, he turned and began punching one of the officers, police said, and a physical altercation began.

According to the LAPD, the officer's partner, Eric Johnson, who has been with the department for 11 years and 6 months, believed Santa Cruz was stabbing his colleague and fired his gun.

Santa Cruz was struck and taken to Harbor UCLA Medical Center, where he died, police said.

The officer involved in the fight sustained injuries to his head and hand and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.
