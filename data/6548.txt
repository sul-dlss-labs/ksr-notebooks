Deputies say a teenager is dead after the stolen SUV he was in with four other teen boys crashed during a police chase early Saturday morning.

A Manatee County deputy first saw the Mercury Mountaineer parked on 17th Avenue West near 75th Street West in Bradenton just before 3:30 a.m.

When the deputy turned around, he saw the same SUV had its lights off and noticed a teenage boy in the driver’s seat. The deputy then turned to get behind the SUV. That’s when the sheriff’s office says four other teenage boys got into the SUV and sped off.

A second deputy witnessed the Mountaineer passing Manatee Avenue South on 75th Street and then saw it speed south on El-Conquistador Parkway from Cortez Road. The suspects then turned north onto 14th Street West.

A deputy started chasing the SUV on 14th Street West. The sheriff’s office says their speeds during the chase reached 76 to 90 mph.

The SUV eventually turned east on 11th Avenue West and crashed into a power pole near 11th Street West.

One of the boys, 16-year-old Jashod Spicer, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Two 15-year-old boys were flown to All Children’s Hospital. A 14-year-old was taken to Manatee Memorial Hospital. They are all expected to be okay.

The 17-year-old driver ran from the scene but eventually showed up at Manatee Memorial Hospital with family members.

While they were investigating, deputies learned the Mountaineer was stolen from a home in Bradenton.

All of the suspects are facing charges of burglary and grand theft auto. The driver could face additional charges.
