Passaic â€” Bail has been raised to $2 million for two Virginia residents whose car crashed into another vehicle in New Jersey while allegedly eluding police, killing a man and leaving an officer shot and wounded.

The increase came after more charges were filed against 34-year-old Marquel Brown and 39-year-old Calvin Raines, both of Petersburg, who had faced only drug-related charges.

Brown was charged Friday with vehicular homicide and aggravated assault, while Raines now faces aggravated assault and weapons offenses.

The incident began Monday night when Passaic police observed an apparent drug deal between people in two cars. After stopping one car in nearby Clifton, a shot was fired from the vehicle and police returned fire.

Passaic Officer Barulio Barbosa was shot in the leg, though it's unclear who shot him. The car then sped off and soon collided with a pickup truck, killing the passenger, 33-year-old Nathan Ferrer of Clifton.
