A former South Whitehall Township police officer charged with killing a man without justification outside Dorney Park was acquitted at trial Thursday.

The jury found Jonathan Roselle not guilty of voluntary manslaughter in the death of Joseph Santos, according to defense attorney Gavin Holihan. The 34-year-old fatally shot Santos outside Dorney Park and Wildwater Kingdom in July 2018.

Lehigh County Deputy District Attorney Jeffrey Dimmig argued Roselle was not justified in using lethal force to subdue Santos. As Santos staggered toward Roselle, the former officer repeatedly told him to stop and get on the ground, and he refused, according to Holihan.

Dimmig argued Roselle had alternatives to shooting Santos, including de-escalation, pepper spray, a baton or stun gun.

Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin said the voluntary manslaughter charge against Roselle was an appropriate charge to put before a jury, according to his office’s spokeswoman, Pam Lehman.

In light of the jury’s verdict Thursday evening, Martin said he respects their decision and thanks them for their service, according to Lehman.

Immediately prior to the shooting Santos, 44, of Paterson, New Jersey, attempted to carjack a vehicle and broke a car window with his hands, police said. He jumped onto Roselle’s police SUV and pounded on the windshield, covering it with blood, Holihan said. He tried to open the SUV door, and then walked away.

A toxicology report showed Santos had methadone, codeine, morphine, hydromorphine and a metabolite of heroin in his system when he was shot.
