Catherine T. Brown, 40, a teacher at Beauvoir National Cathedral Elementary School in Washington, was pronounced dead at the scene after being shot in the garage of her home in the 9400 block of Vineyard Haven Drive in Montgomery Village, police said.

The lieutenant governor flew back to Maryland yesterday morning from Denver, where he was participating in the Democratic National Convention. "I leave my fellow delegates with a heavy heart, and I ask that everyone keep my family in their prayers," he said in a statement.

About 10:30 p.m. Saturday, police responded to reports of a woman being threatened by a gunman, authorities said. When officers reached the scene, they found Catherine Brown being held hostage in her garage by her ex-boyfriend, Michael K. Wilson, who had a gun.

As police officers tried to negotiate with Wilson, "shots were fired," according to the police account. Investigators found that a bullet from Wilson's gun struck and killed Brown, while several shots from one or both of the responding police officers killed Wilson, who was also pronounced dead at the scene.

Montgomery County Officers Sandra Moss and Kenneth Moreau were placed on routine administrative leave while police investigate the shootings.

Wilson, 44, was a private security guard at Washington National Cathedral. The circumstances surrounding his dispute with Brown remain under investigation.
