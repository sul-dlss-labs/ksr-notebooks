Officers fatally shot a 70-year-old Springfield man during a confrontation Tuesday morning, police said.

Springfield police Lt. Scott McKee said three officers shot at Robert Earl Vaughan because he "presented a lethal threat," the Register-Guard reports. McKee didn't immediately know if Vaughan pointed a firearm at officers or fired toward them, according to the newspaper.

McKee said patrol officers went to Vaughan's home shortly before sunrise Tuesday after neighbors reported that he was shooting a rifle in his front yard. McKee said the Vaughan told one neighbor that he wanted police to kill him.

McKee said officers used a loudspeaker to talk to Vaughan, who was inside, the Register-Guard reports. Vaughan's replies were "hostile" and mostly "unintelligible," McKee said.

Vaughan closed window coverings and barricaded himself inside his home, McKee said. And around 6:55 a.m. — just under 90 minutes after police responded to the area — the officers shot him during a confrontation, McKee said.

No officers were hurt, according to the Register-Guard. McKee said Vaughan was inside when he was shot and that because of the barricade, officers didn't locate his body until more than 40 minutes after the shooting, according to the newspaper.

McKee said officers have previously gone to the home on gun-related calls, and also went there when Vaughan attempted suicide June 30. McKee said officers took four loaded weapons for safekeeping during that incident, but Vaughan refused to grant them access to a larger gun safe.

The Lane County Interagency Deadly Force Investigation Team and district attorney are investigating the shooting, McKee said.

McKee said the three Springfield officers who fired shots are on paid administrative leave, the Register-Guard reports. That's standard procedure in such incidents.
