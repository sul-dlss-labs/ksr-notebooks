Jackson Alexander, 28, wielded this 8-inch blade when he lunged at cops in front of Zen Spa on Court St. Friday night. Police shot and killed the crazed Carroll Gardens man.

The unhinged Brooklyn man shot and killed by police Friday was urged to get psychiatric help moments before he stabbed his roommate and set off a chain of events that led to his death.

"You need to get to the doctor," Court St. resident Roland Lindo, 53, recalled telling his roommate, Jackson Alexandre, 28, shortly before the knife-wielding madman charged officers with an 8-inch blade. "Then he just stabbed me."

Lindo said Alexandre was pacing and muttering to himself before he jammed a knife into his shoulder as he and a friend watched a Knicks game at 8 p.m.

Lindo ran downstairs to a Court St. spa for help. Alexandre cursed at arriving officers before knocking one to the ground and lunging at the other.+

"You punk-a-- motherf--kers!" he screamed before he was shot.

The officers fired nine shots, hitting Alexandre eight times, after he refused to drop his weapon, sources said.
