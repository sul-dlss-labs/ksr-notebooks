An autopsy will be performed Monday on the body of a man who died while he was being booked into the Rock Island County Jail.

Darryl D. Mason, 42, of East Moline, had been arrested and then was transported to the Rock Island County Jail "when he became unresponsive and emergency personnel were summoned," said Rock Island County Coroner Brian Gustafson. Mason died at the trauma center of Trinity Medical Center, West Campus, Gustafson said.

It was not known Sunday night what charges Mason had been facing. Monday's autopsy will be completed in Rockford, Ill.

The Rock Island County Integrity Task Force is investigating Mason's death, said Illinois State Police Master Sgt. Rene Sandoval, task force commander.

Officers from various agencies serve on the county's Integrity Task Force, which was formed in 2008, Sandoval said.

"It's comprised of officers on the Illinois side of the river," including police department representatives from Milan, Rock Island, Moline and East Moline; the Rock Island County Sheriff's Department; and the Illinois State Police.

The task force answers to a board that includes the police chiefs and sheriffs of the agencies within the unit, Sandoval said. The task force investigates officer-involved shootings, in-custody deaths and other serious allegations and incidents.

"It's an independent unit, so you don't have one agency investigating itself," Sandoval said. "At the conclusion of its investigation, the findings will be turned over to Rock Island County State's Attorney Jeff Terronez," Sandoval said.

Members of the task force are interviewing several people, he said, adding that more information could be available Tuesday.
