EVERETT, MA â€“ The Everett police officer who fatally shot a man earlier this year has been cleared by the Middlesex County District Attorney's Office.

District Attorney Marian Ryan announced Wednesday that her office had completed their investigation into the April 21 shooting death of 48-year-old Mario Mejia-Martinez, of Everett. "This investigation concludes that, in the totality of the circumstances, the officer was justified in the use of deadly force and that there was no criminal conduct involved in the shooting of Mario Mejia-Martinez," the office said in a statement.

The Everett police officer who shot Mejia-Martinez was identified by the DA as Joseph Pepicelli. According to the office's findings, Pepicelli made multiple attempts to maintain a distance between himself and Mejia-Martinez and repeatedly commanded him to drop the knife. Pepicelli fired his weapon only after Mejia-Martinez charged at him and came close to stabbing him with the knife, the DA's office concluded.
