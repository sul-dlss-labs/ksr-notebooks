FEDERAL WAY, Wash. -- A 21-year-old man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in Federal Way Saturday night.



Police say Federal Way officers were dispatched to Camelot Square mobile home park in the 3000 block of S. 288th Street for a reported domestic violence situation between two adult brothers. One of the brothers was armed with a knife.



Before officers arrived, other members of the family locked themselves in one of the rooms inside the home fearing for their safety.



After officers arrived, they assisted family members as they escaped out through a window.



The 21-year old Hispanic suspect was armed with knives when he confronted police officers.



According to spokesman Stan McCall, the suspect made a statement about wanting to die, and then he moved toward the officers.



Two officers responded simultaneously by firing their weapons. Medics pronounced the assailant dead at the scene.



The Federal Way Police officers who fired their weapons have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of this investigation, which is standard procedure.



The Valley Investigative Team (VIT) was requested. They will assume responsibility for this investigation.
