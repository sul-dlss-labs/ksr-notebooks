Authorities on Tuesday released the name of the man who was shot and killed by a Phoenix police sergeant after the two were involved in an altercation last weekend in west Phoenix.

Phoenix police say 25-year-old Willie Neall Harden died Sunday night as a result of his injuries.

The patrol sergeant, a 29-year veteran of the agency, was parked in a vacant lot near 59th Avenue and McDowell Road about 8:45 a.m. doing paperwork when Harden approached him, Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Steve Martos said. The sergeant, believing Harden needed help, rolled down his window to talk to him.

The discussion between the two led to an altercation, during which Harden reached into the sergeant's vehicle while the sergeant still was sitting inside, Martos said. The sergeant ultimately shot Harden during the course of the physical altercation.

Harden was taken to the hospital in critical condition where he later died. The sergeant sustained a minor injury.

It was not immediately clear what the altercation was about or if Harden had a weapon, Martos said. Phoenix detectives are investigating the shooting.

The sergeant had been doing paperwork related to a fatal fire that occurred overnight at an adjacent apartment complex that killed a 14-year-old girl.

Martos said investigators did not believe the two incidents were related.
