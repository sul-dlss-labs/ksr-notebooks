A Fremont man who died in a motorcycle accident had been involved in a high-speed pursuit, authorities announced Monday.

Justin D. Young, 28, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident that took place at 3:43 p.m. Friday.

A press release from the Dodge County Attorney’s Office stated Young was westbound on the former U.S. Highway 275 near Hills Farm Road when a Dodge County sheriff’s deputy clocked the green 2000 Kawasaki motorcycle at 71 mph in a 55 mph zone.

The deputy began following Young and activated his overhead lights. When Young did not stop, the deputy activated his siren.

Then, authorities said, Young turned around, looked at the deputy and then accelerated. It is estimated Young was traveling 110 mph and the deputy called off the pursuit.

Young, however, continued heading west and passed other vehicles in the eastbound lanes before he collided with a tow truck at Downing Street. The tow truck was driven by Scott Taylor of Lyons.

Deputies attempted CPR on the scene and Fremont Fire Department paramedics advised Young had died.

The Nebraska State Patrol and the Fremont Police Department assisted at the scene. Because a Dodge County deputy was involved in the pursuit prior to the collison, the Nebraska State Patrol is investigating the accident, the press release stated.

Dodge County Attorney Oliver Glass stated a grand jury might be called, which is a standard procedure in such cases.

The funeral service for Young is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday at Moser Memorial Chapel in Fremont.
