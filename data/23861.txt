PIMA COUNTY, AZ ( Tucson News Now) - One person is dead and another in the hospital for treatment of non-life threatening injuries, according to an update from Sgt. Kim Bay with the Tucson Police Department.

Two men were in a car that collided with a front loader in the 2000 block of W. Valencia Road on Wednesday, Feb. 7.

The car was being pursued by a Pima County Sheriff's Department deputy at the time of the crash.

The deputy was responding to a 911 call at a convenience store at 2840 W. Los Reales Road when he saw the car, which matched a description of the suspect car from that call. He attempted to stop the car, but the driver fled.

The area where the driver lost control is under construction and driver struck several of construction pylons. He continued eastbound in the closed curb lane before striking the front bucket of a front loader that was parked in the lane.

The passenger was pronounced dead at the hospital. His identity is being withheld, pending next of kin notification. The driver sustained serious, but non-life-threatening injuries and remains in the hospital.

Neither the driver nor the passenger was wearing a seatbelt. The investigation is ongoing but speed appears to be a factor in this collision. Detectives are continuing the investigation into possible impairment on the driver. No citations or arrests have been made at this time. Additional information will be released as it becomes available.
