A Loxley man died Sunday afternoon after trying to flee from police, according to Alabama State Troopers.

Chad Cullen Childress, 33, was not wearing a seat belt while driving a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer on Truck Trail 17, 10 miles north of Loxley, said Trooper Jamie Maloy.

At 2:55 p.m., the Blazer left the roadway, struck a tree and overturned. Childress was ejected from the SUV, Maloy said.

Medics pronounced him dead at the scene of the crash.

"Prior to the crash, Childress was attempting to elude Loxley police after fleeing from a previous traffic stop," Maloy said.

Troopers continued to investigate the collision Monday.
