DALLAS — It’s another officer-involved shooting and Dallas PD has already released cell phone video of the incident.

Sunday night, cops responded to a call regarding a minor car crash at Avondale Parc Apartments in Dallas. When officers arrived, they found 24-year-old Gerardo Ramirez in the parking lot armed with a handgun.

“This incident did not involve Mr. Ramirez, but he told his girlfriend that he did not want to live and wanted to shoot at the officers,” Dallas PD Deputy Chief Rob Sherwin explained.

Cops say Ramirez fired his handgun into the air several times.

“The shots were really close to my door, so I was really scared for my life and my family’s life,” Ramirez’s neighbor Teresa Macedo told NewsFix.

When police approached Ramirez, they say he shot at them several times before officers shot and killed him. The two officers involved in the shooting were not wearing body cams. The only video, so far, was shot by a witness on a cell phone.

DPD says video evidence is important in this case.

“It appears this early in the investigation that his intent was to lure them in,” Sherwin added.

In fact, DPD says this is the second run-in they’ve had with Ramirez. In August, he also threatened to kill himself. Cops say Ramirez’s girlfriend claims he was acting strange and was under the influence of drugs.

“I’m so thankful that in this day and age, people do pull out their cell phones and they do record,” Deputy Sherwin said.
