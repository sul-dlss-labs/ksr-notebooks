INDIANAPOLIS — A longtime officer with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department hit and killed a man while driving his squad car on patrol late Sunday night, police say.

It happened shortly after 11 p.m. on the city’s southwest side, near the intersection of Kentucky Avenue and South Lynhurst Drive.

Investigators say the officer told them he was driving northeast on Kentucky Avenue, and he did not see the man before he hit the victim just before the stoplight at Lynhurst, according to police.

As with any deadly traffic accident, investigators will conduct a blood draw on the officer.

IMPD PIO Genae Cook said, “As you know, anyone who travels in this area—especially at night time—as you can tell it’s very dark, it’s in between intersections. The intersections are marked with lights, but in between there it’s a very dark area. And of course with storms and cloud coverage makes the natural light- none.”
