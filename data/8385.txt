A San Bernardino man was shot and killed by police after he attacked an officer and pointed a stun gun at him during a traffic stop, San Bernardino police said Tuesday.

About 6:30 p.m. Monday, officers spotted a man running from their police car toward a vehicle parked in an alley on North Wall Avenue, Lt. David Harp said. Police approached the vehicle and asked the four occupants to step out.

One of the men, identified as Cedric James May, 22, emerged from the back seat, tried to grab an officer’s baton and gun, and finally got hold of the officer’s Taser and pointed it at the officer’s face, Harp said.

May, who was paroled on Sunday after serving prison time on drug charges, was shot and pronounced dead at the scene, Harp said.

Another passenger was cited for interfering with police officers. The other two were not charged.
