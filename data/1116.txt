"I couldn't believe it, because nobody called," Mercy Purganan said.

Nobody called because the Honolulu Medical Examiner had no clue of the teenager's identity. Jeremy was not carrying any identification.

Jeremy Purganan, 17, died when the stolen car he was driving slammed into a light pole during a high-speed chase with police on Pulelo Street off Lumiaina Street.

The medical examiner had the victim's fingerprints but could not submit them to Honolulu police for comparison with fingerprints on file in their computer without a name.
