A rape suspect surrounded by sheriff’s deputies killed himself Thursday night by driving full speed into the side of a building.

“He was saying things like, ‘You guys are going to have to shoot me, I’m not giving up,’” said Sheriff’s Sgt. Ruben Gracia. “Then he just gassed it and drove himself into the side of a building.”

The dead man was identified as Isaac Magana, 42, of Pico Rivera. He also was wanted on suspicion of kidnapping.

Officers said Magana led them on a 20-minute chase on the San Gabriel River Freeway, then he stopped near Whittier Boulevard and Gregg Road about 10 p.m.

Deputies surrounded Magana’s van and tried to persuade him to surrender.
