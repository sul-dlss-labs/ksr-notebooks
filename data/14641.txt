DA finds Henderson police officers justified in fatal shooting in June

The district attorney has ruled Henderson police officers justified in the fatal shooting of a man who wounded one of several patrol officers investigating a report of gunshots at a home last June.

Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson said Friday that 37-year-old Ryan Marone appeared to have his hands up but hid a pistol behind his head before shooting and wounding Officer Timothy Donnelly in the hip.

Donnelly and three other Henderson police officers returned fire, killing Marone.

Wolfson noted that toxicology reports showed high levels of methamphetamine and hydrocodone in Marone's system, his blood-alcohol level was 0.114 percent, and his estranged family suggested he wanted police to kill him.

Wolfson says Donnelly and officers Troy McDermed, Carlos Chorens and David Woolman acted lawfully.
