Lubbock Police have released an update regarding a situation earlier this week where a man was shot after reportedly charging at police officers with knives.

According to Lubbock Police Sergeant Jason Lewis, Lubbock Police responded to a call in the 2000 block of 63rd Street at 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, May 7th.

A subject, later identified as 30-year-old Arnesto Ramos, spoke to officers but refused to open the door.

Officers had no reason to enter the residence, so they left the scene.

At around 11:20 a.m. the same day, officers returned to the address and met with the homeowner, who advised them that Ramos was not a resident and was trespassing. The homeowner wanted Ramos removed from the house.

When the four officers on scene attempted to make contact with Ramos, he reportedly barricaded himself in a closet with two knives.

Lubbock Police say that they negotiated with Ramos for almost an hour and was offered many opportunities to surrender, but he refused.

Ramos reportedly charged at the officers, armed with what LPD describes as a “small sword.”

An LPD corporal attempted to stop Ramos using a “less lethal” bean bag round. The round did not stop Ramos from charging at the officers, and two officers shot Ramos.

Ramos was taken to University Medical Center with life-threatening injuries. He died a short time later.
