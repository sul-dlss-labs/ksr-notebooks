A Bartow County grand jury has declined to indict a Euharlee police officer in the shooting death of a teenager earlier this year. The grand jury returned a no bill on the proposed indictment of Cpl. Beth Gatney, who fatally shot 17-year-old Christopher Roupe on Feb. 14 while she and another officer were serving arrest warrants at a home in Eagle View Mobile Home Park in the small Bartow city. An officer told authorities that Roupe opened the door and pointed a gun at officers. However, an attorney for Roupe's family said the teenager was holding a Nintendo Wii game controller when he was fatally wounded. The Cherokee Judicial Circuit District Attorney's office sought to indict Gatney on manslaughter and reckless conduct charges, but the grand jury did not find enough evidence to substantiate those charges.

"Because the grand jury has determined that the actions of officer Gatny did not rise to the level of a criminal offense, this concludes the involvement of the District Attorneyâ€™s Office in this matter," District Attorney Rosemary Greene said in a press release.

A previous grand jury recommended the district attorney take action in the case, noting Gatney used unauthorized force in the case.Roupe was a student at Woodland High School and was a member of the school's JROTC program.
