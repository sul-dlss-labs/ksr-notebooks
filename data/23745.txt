LINCOLN COUNTY, N.C. -- State Highway Patrol says a motorcyclist was killed yesterday while trying to get away from Lincolnton Police.

Troopers say 49-year-old Edward Case from Mount Holly wouldn't pull over for officers, and as he tried to pass a car on East Highway 27 in Iron Station, he swerved into oncoming traffic.

He hit a pickup truck head on and his body was thrown. The impact of the motorcycle caused the truck to flip.

Authorities say the two women inside that truck have minor injuries.

State Highway Patrol and Lincolnton Police are investigating.
