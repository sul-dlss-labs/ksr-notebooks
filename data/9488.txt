A grand jury investigation is expected in the death of a Fremont man whose car crashed early Sunday while he was being pursued by police south of Schuyler.

Jose Antonio Sanchez-Ramirez, 23, was pronounced dead at the scene of the accident along Nebraska 15 near Octavia, according to a report by County Attorney Julie Reiter, who serves as county coroner.

Reiter said that Schuyler Police began pursuing Sanchez-Ramirez's car in Schuyler just before 12:30 a.m. Sunday. The car left the road on the curve on Nebraska 15 near Octavia, and ended up over an embankment.

Sanchez-Ramirez was ejected from the car. Octavia is four miles south of Schuyler in northeast Butler County.

Reiter said that under state law, a Butler County grand jury will be convened to look into the death because it occurred as Sanchez-Ramirez was being apprehended by law enforcement at the time of his death.

As of Tuesday morning, Reiter said she did not have the full reports on the crash or the reason that Sanchez-Ramirez was being pursued.

The Nebraska State Patrol is performing an accident reconstruction to provide more information about the incident.
