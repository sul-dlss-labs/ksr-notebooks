A man who confronted officers with large kitchen knives in the backyard of a Gilbert home was fatally shot by police Thursday night, according to a statement by Mesa police.

The dead man was identified as Sergio Ochoa, 27, of Mesa.

Mesa and Gilbert police were involved in the confrontation just before 10 p.m.

Jesse Sanger, Gilbert police spokesman, said the chain of events began with police responding to a call of domestic abuse.

According to Mesa police, officers were called to a residence in the 4000 block of East Holmes Avenue about 9:30 p.m. after a woman said her ex-boyfriend was threatening with a gun. The man left and went to another nearby residence, attempted to take another woman's telephone, and then left in a vehicle. He was spotted by police near Lindsay Road and Southern Avenue. The driver failed to stop, and a Mesa police helicopter joined the pursuit.

Ochoa got out of his vehicle and entered a house in the 600 block of East Cathy Drive in Gilbert, with officers in pursuit, police said.

In the backyard, Ochoa threatened officers with large kitchen knives, according to a statement by Mesa police released Friday afternoon. Officers attempted a less-lethal beanbag round that was unsuccessful at stopping him, police said. As Ochoa continued to advance toward officers, the officers fired, police said.

Ochoa was pronounced dead at a hospital. The knives were recovered from the scene, police said.

The Gilbert Police Department will be the primary investigating agency for the officer-involved shooting. Mesa police are investigating earlier events that occurred in Mesa and are tied to the case.

Mesa police said Friday they did not expect updates on the investigations until next week.
