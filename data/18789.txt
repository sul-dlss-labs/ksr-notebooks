CHELSEA, MI - A 52-year-old woman was killed after the investigation of a stolen vehicle resulted in a two-vehicle traffic crash on Nov. 20 in Chelsea, Michigan State Police said.

The traffic crash prompted the closure of all lanes of highway M-52, from Old US-12 to Old Manchester Road in Chelsea, for about four and a half hours Monday, Nov. 20.

The chase began when a state trooper sought to investigate a stolen Chrysler 300 traveling eastbound on I-94 that then exited the highway onto northbound M-52, according to police.

The trooper activated his emergency lights for the traffic stop and the driver of the Chrysler started to pull over to the shoulder before speeding off, police said.

After a short pursuit, the driver of the stolen vehicle struck a Chevrolet Traverse exiting the parking lot of Polly's Country Market at 1255 S. Main St. about 2:45 p.m., according to state police.

The driver of the Chevrolet Traverse, a 52-year-old woman, was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

She was not immediately identified.

The 34-year-old driver of the stolen Chrysler was taken into custody and was being treated for injuries, police said.

Criminal charges are pending.

Anyone who witnessed the traffic crash is asked to contact MSP Fifth District Headquarters at 269-657-6081.

Motorists were advised to avoid the half-mile stretch of road through a Nixle alert released by the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office that went out around 3 p.m. Monday, Nov. 20.

The roadway was opened back up around 7:30 p.m.
