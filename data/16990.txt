An Indianapolis man shot by police officers early Thursday after they say he waved a gun as they entered his Southwestside home with a search warrant has died.

Jason Bryant, 34, was pronounced dead at Eskenazi Hospital hours after he was shot by officers from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department at his home in the 2200 block of Conrad Avenue, according to police.

IMPD Lt. Rich Riddle said the incident began around 1:30 a.m. when officers tried to stop the truck Bryant was driving.

Riddle said Bryant fled from officers who chased the truck until they saw him ditch the vehicle and go into the home. Police determined the truck was stolen from Whiteland on Nov. 23.

Officers surrounded the home until they secured a search warrant to enter, Riddle said.

When police went inside the home around 5:30 a.m., they saw Bryant sitting in a back bedroom with a gun, Riddle said.

Two officers, a 28-year veteran sergeant and a 12-year veteran patrol officer, fired their weapons, striking the suspect, police said. Bryant did not fire his gun.

Bryant was then rushed to Eskenazi where he later died, police said.

A second search warrant served at the house led to the discovery of a handgun, police said. Bryant was out on bond for a separate case with charges of dealing and possession of methamphetamine, and being a serious violent felon in possession of a handgun.

The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. They are both assigned to the Southwest District.

The shooting remains under investigation.
