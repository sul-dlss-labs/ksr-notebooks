The New Orleans Police Department on Friday released video of a 7th Ward gun battle last month between a man and police officers that investigators said ended when the man killed himself.

Police said the video shows Bernie Porche, 37, run across a street firing at New Orleans police and a state trooper, prompting NOPD Officers Gregory Rotton and Benjamin Williams to return fire.

After being wounded twice by officers, police said, Porche raised a 9mm handgun and shot himself once in the head.
