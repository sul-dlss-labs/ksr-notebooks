TULSA -- Police are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting in east Tulsa on Monday afternoon.

The shooting was reported near 8500 East 41st Street near an Extended Stay Inn. Police said a suspect was hit and killed in the shooting.

Police officers with a gang unit were patrolling the area Monday when they approached a suspicious vehicle with multiple people inside.

Officers noticed one of the three men inside the vehicle had a gun. Police said that man fired the gun once at officers.

The suspect, who had four felony warramts, was then shot by officers, police said. Two officers fired shots on the man.

“Hotels are a hot spot for criminal activity and that’s possibly why they were at this location,” said Tulsa police spokeswoman Jeannie MacKenzie.

Two other men were inside the vehicle. They were taken into custody by police.
