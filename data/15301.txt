BLAINE, Minn. — Anoka County authorities say a man has died after crashing his vehicle during a police chase.

Authorities pronounced the 28-year-old Coon Rapids man dead at the scene Sunday in Blaine. The county sheriff’s office says the driver sped up when a Coon Rapids police officer tried to stop him for driving recklessly.

Authorities say he ran a red light and hit a brick sign just over the Blaine line. They suspect alcohol was a factor in the crash.

No other vehicles were involved. Authorities haven’t released the man’s name.
