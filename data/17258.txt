SANTA CLARITA >> Authorities Friday identified a man who fatally shot himself during a standoff with deputies in Canyon Country.

The man, identified by the coroner’s office as 31-year-old Corey Paul Kieffer, was found dead about 2:30 a.m. Thursday inside a shed by SWAT deputies, said sheriff’s Deputy Trina Schrader.

The standoff in the 19600 block of Babington Street began about 4:45 p.m. Wednesday, according to Sgt. Brian Allen of the sheriff’s Santa Clarita Valley Station.

The man, a parolee, claimed to have weapons, Allen said.

“That was confirmed when he fired off a round from inside the shed,” Schrader said.

Deputies initially saw him run across the Santa Clarita River bed and into a residential area. They searched for him for more than two hours and did not find him, Allen said.

Then, just before 8 p.m. Wednesday, a man called authorities and said his dog alerted him to the fact the man was holed up in a shed. The SWAT team and crisis negotiators were sent to the location try to get him to surrender peacefully but failed, Schrader said.
