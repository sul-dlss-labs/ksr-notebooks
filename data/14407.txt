CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A Charlotte teen was found drowned in a pond off Randolph Road. Police say he may have gone into the water last week to get away from police.

Family members reported 19-year-old Demonta Gaither missing over the weekend. They hadn’t seen him since last Thursday.

Monday morning Charlotte Fire Department’s Dive Team searched the waters of a retention pond next to the County Health Department on Billingsley Road. Just after noon, Gaither’s body was pulled from the water. His family said he couldn’t swim.

Police say he may have been attempting to elude officers investigating a call Thursday night about an attempted car break-in. CMPD says officers chased Gaither and his friend Cedric Young after seeing them in the area, but gave up their pursuit when the pair ran into woods near the pond.

Police say Young told them later that he knew they were no longer being chased but wouldn’t say why they went into the water. “We asked him a series of questions trying to get some information, but he did not give any specific rationale for why they went into the water,” said CMPD Capt. Cecil Brisbon.

Police say even though Gaither was no longer being chased he may still have tried to swim across the pond in an effort to get out of the area.

Gaither’s family says he couldn’t swim.

Police say they do not believe any foul play was involved.
