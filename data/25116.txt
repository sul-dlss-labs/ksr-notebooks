STILLWATER, MN — The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension has released video from the Nov. 21 Stillwater police shooting that left a 22-year-old man dead. After a BCA investigation, the Washington County Attorney's Office declined to issue criminal charges in the death, finding that the Stillwater officer was justified in using deadly force.

"These incidents are tragic for everyone involved," the Washington County Sheriff's Office said in a statement Thursday. "The videos and reports show that Officer Julien and the assisting officers went to extraordinary lengths to avoid the use of deadly force, including lengthy verbal de-escalation and Taser deployments, and that deadly force was used truly as a last resort."

Keaton James Larson, a 2015 graduate of Stillwater Area High School, was shot after police responded to a call about a suicidal man in the early morning hours of Nov. 21, according to authorities.

Keaton James Larson Obituary Stillwater police said Larson was armed with a knife when officers encountered him at a home on the 1200 block of 4th Street South at 1 a.m. Officers tried using Tasers three times, but they were ineffective, according to the BCA.

Patch interviewed Larson's mother after the fatal shooting. Tessa Andrews told Patch that her son "did not deserve to die in his cry for help." Stillwater Police Chief John Gannaway told Patch in an email in December that officers receive training in responding to mental health incidents.

"We want to help you, brother." Officers pleaded with Larson for several minutes, asking him to put down the knife.
