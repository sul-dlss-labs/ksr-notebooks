The two suspects allegedly involved in the Friday night shooting of Auburn Police Officer Justin Sanders died in a murder-suicide and not in a house fire, authorities said Monday, citing preliminary autopsy results.

Christopher James Wallace, 38, of Spanish Fort, and a 36-year-old woman whom police identified but are not releasing the name of until next of kin is notified, died after Wallace shot the woman and then turned the gun on himself, police said.

“Weapons consistent with causing the fatal gunshot injuries were recovered adjacent to the bodies at the scene by law enforcement,” Auburn police said.

Wallace allegedly fired shots at Sanders after the Auburn officer was conducting a traffic stop following an armed robbery.

Authorities said Friday that Wallace barricaded himself and the woman in an apartment where a relative of the woman lived. The house caught fire shortly after Wallace locked himself and the woman inside, but authorities said the two did not die from the fire.

Officers used tear gas and “destraction devices” in an unsuccessful attempt to get the suspects to vacate the apartment. Authorities said Monday that they would not be releasing information on where on their bodies the suspects were shot “at this time.”

Meanwhile, Sanders had “significant surgery” at UAB Hospital on Monday morning and is “doing well,” according to a GoFundMe page set up to help pay for the officer’s medical bills.

The page, “Prayers for Justin," is nearing its $25,000 goal. As of Monday afternoon, the page raised more than $23,000 in two days.
