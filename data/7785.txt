An off duty NYPD lieutenant fatally shot and stabbed his wife and then turned his gun on himself yesterday afternoon in their Centereach home. Francis Cole, 48, a 19-year NYPD vet who worked at the 68th Precinct, first stabbed wife Elena, 46, in the chest and then shot her in the head. Their 18-year-old daughter tried to intervene, but Newsday reports, "he struck his daughter in the face." The daughter then called 911; Cole, who shot himself in the head, was conscious when the ambulance arrived but he died at the hospital. Suffolk County police Det. Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick says there was "a general atmosphere of trouble," because the couple were getting divorced. Neighbors were shocked and surprised to hear the couple were divorcing; one told the Post, "There was no sign of anything. Never an argument, nothing. They were the ideal family."
