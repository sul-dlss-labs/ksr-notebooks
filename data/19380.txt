The incident happened the evening of Dec. 6th , when police said 23-year-old Samuel Freeman aimed a gun at police in front of the Family Dollar, located on West 28th Street.

Price said a task force unit was watching the store when a group of people approached the business and started to rob it. Instead of risking a hostage situation, the officers waited until the men left the store to confront them,and that's when Freeman pulled the gun and the officer shot him, added Price. Freeman has since died of injuries from the incident.
