A Westborough, Massachusetts, man who was shot and killed by police on Friday afternoon had stabbed his wife multiple times, according to police.

The man, who has not been identified by police, allegedly stabbed his wife inside their Windsor Ridge Drive apartment around midday Friday.

The woman fled to a neighboring apartment where residents called 911. The man then followed her to that apartment where he continued to attack her, police said.

When police arrived, they ordered the man to drop the knife. When he refused, a police sergeant shot him. He was taken to an area hospital, where he later died.

The man's wife was also taken to the hospital and is now in stable condition.

Sgt. Jonathan Kalagher, the officer who shot and killed the man, has been placed on administrative leave in accordance with department policy.

State police continue to investigate the incident.

Neighbors said last week that they received limited information about the incident.

"The only thing I know is that there was a fight between a couple and then a police officer unfortunately had to come in and take care of whatever," neighbor Sarah Coon said.

Another resident who was outside during the police response said she couldn't get back to her home.

"When I threw the garbage out, I could see something going on. And then I could overhear one of the other residents talking to someone saying someone heard two gunshots, so I was like, 'Oh, dear god," neighbor Jan Hardy recalled.
