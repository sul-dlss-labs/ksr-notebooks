Body camera video released Sunday by the Daytona Beach Police Department shows the moment a man opened fire on police Saturday afternoon. You can watch the body camera video above. Viewer discretion is advised. Police said the suspect was shot dead by police after he opened fire on officers serving a warrant for his arrest. The Daytona Beach police chief says one of the officers was shot in the chest but was wearing his bulletproof vest and was expected to recover soon. Another officer tripped running around in the shootout and injured his head. The suspect was 44-year-old Michael Harris, who was wanted in connection with a shooting involving a woman earlier this month. Daytona Beach police Chief Craig Capri said Holly Hill police received an anonymous tip Harris was at the apartment complex.The two agencies approached the apartment together. When officers entered the apartment, Harris ran to a bedroom, Capri said.Capri said officers ordered him to surrender and followed him. When officers opened the door, Harris shot at them, Capri said."We don't want to take a life, we want to save a life," Capri said. "He tried to murder these officers. We had a warrant for his arrest. All he had to do was surrender peacefully."Capri said it's his policy to release body camera video as quickly as possible, particularly when his officers have to use deadly force."My thing is to release the video as quickly as possible-- to get it out there so the public can see what happened," Capri said. "If we did something wrong we have to acknowledge that. So, it does no good to hold back video because people think,' Oh you are hiding something, covering something.'"The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shootout.
