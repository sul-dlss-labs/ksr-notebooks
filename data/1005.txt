A Cottonwood man is dead and an officer is injured following a domestic violence arrest gone awry Saturday.

Shortly after 4:30 p.m., officers responded to 2591 Montain View Dr. #3 in Cottonwood to a report of a family fight.

During the investigation, deputies attempted to place Gary Michael Gamblin, 30, under arrest. Gamblin resisted arrest, and both he and an officer were shot in a confrontation that ensued. The deputy's injury was not life-threatening. However, Gamblin suffered a fatal wound.

The Department of Public Safety's Special Investigations Unit was called to the scene to investigate. No further information was available Sunday afternoon.
