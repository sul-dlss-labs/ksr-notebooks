The police had been looking for Mr. Allen because they believed he shot a co-worker, Clard Coleman, 40, at 1:50 a.m. that day at LaGuardia Community College. Fleeing the police, Mr. Allen crashed his car into two other vehicles at Farmers Boulevard and 109th Avenue, jumped out and was confronted by the eight officers, the chief said. Mr. Allen held his gun to his head and shouted angrily at the officers, and when he turned the gun toward them, they fired.

The preliminary investigation has found no evidence to suggest that Mr. Allen fired his pistol at the officers, the chief said. But he noted that some officers -- both those who fired their weapons and others who witnessed the shooting -- thought he had, while some in both groups thought he had not.

Chief Collins said that the initial police investigation found that the shooting appeared to be within the department's guidelines for the use of deadly force. An officer is allowed to shoot if he or she thinks an armed suspect is a threat.

"It appears to be within the guidelines, but we're still reviewing the sequence of events," Chief Collins said. The investigation by the Police Department and the office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, is in its early stages, and many witnesses -- including more than half of the roughly 50 officers who were at the scene -- have yet to be interviewed, the chief said.

Nonetheless, shootings with such a high number of rounds fired provoke intense scrutiny, both in the department and from outside critics. A team of department experts will focus closely on the officers' tactics and the decisions they made in firing that many shots, as they have done in other high-profile cases, like the shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West African immigrant who died in a hail of 41 bullets in 1999.
