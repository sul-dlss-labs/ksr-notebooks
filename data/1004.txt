A San Diego police officer shot and killed an unarmed man who lunged at him after a brief chase Saturday morning, authorities said. The officer, who was not identified, shot the man three times in the chest, said San Diego police homicide Capt. Ron Newman. The man, who was not identified pending notification of family, was taken to Scripps Mercy Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Newman said. The officer was flagged down about 8:20 a.m. Saturday by the driver of a city bus after a man punched a 12-year-old passenger and a woman who tried to intervene, police said. As the officer got out of his car, the attacker approached him and “told the officer he was going to take his gun and he was going to kill him,” Newman said. The man ran away when the officer drew his baton and ordered him to stop. After a short chase, he stopped near a parking area. The man followed the officer’s orders to get down on the ground. But after a few seconds, he got up and charged the officer, who opened fire, authorities said.
