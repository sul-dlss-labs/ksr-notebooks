No indictment for Pagedale policeman

A grand jury refuses to indict a Pagedale policeman in a fatal shooting. Officers say Arthur Dobbins was shot and killed by officer Charles Hubbard as Dobbins tried to take a gun away from another officer. The prosecutor says tests show Dobbins had three times as much of the drug PCP in his system as necessary to turn a person violent and combative. And the test show Dobbins was legally drunk. Dobbinsâ€™ father says he still plans to file a civil lawsuit against the city of Pagedale.
