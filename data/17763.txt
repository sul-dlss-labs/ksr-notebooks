The unidentified agent sustained multiple bruises and cuts and was diagnosed with a concussion after attempting to apprehend a man who crossed illegally into the United States.

The incident happened late Thursday night near Somerton, Arizona. The suspect was part of a group of three men who separated and fled when contacted by Border Patrol agents.

At a press conference, Mario Villareal, acting chief for the Yuma Border Patrol Sector says the agent was attacked during the arrest.

“The subject grabbed the agent’s radio and collapsible steel baton and began striking him in the face and head while he also attempted to remove the agent’s sidearm from its holster," Villareal said. "The agent, fearing for his life, discharged his weapon, which struck the suspect.”

Both were taken to Yuma Regional Medical Center where the suspect was pronounced dead. The other two suspects were arrested without incident.

No details about the shooting or the suspects have been released. Customs and border protection’s use of force incident team and the FBI are investigating.

The agent has been placed on administrative leave.
