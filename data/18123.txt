A domestic violence suspect committed suicide Friday, Aug. 26, 2016 at Birmingham's Southtown public housing community.

An armed domestic violence suspect committed suicide today in front of Birmingham police officers responding to the call.

Birmingham police South Precinct officers were dispatched just before 3 p.m. to an apartment in the Southtown public housing community on Ninth Court South. Authorities said the man was at the rear of his girlfriend's apartment beating on the door and trying to get inside. She locked the door and called 911.

As officers went around to the rear of the apartment, the suspect pulled a gun and shot himself in the head. He was pronounced dead on the scene. "I heard fussing and then I just heard, 'Pow''' said a woman who lives next door.

Authorities have not identified the man. He is believed to be in his 20s.

Multiple officers flocked to the scene. "Seeing someone take their own life is traumatic for anyone and it's no different for officers. They're human too,'' said South Precinct Capt. Ron Sellers. "We've talked to both officers and they seem OK. We will ensure they have people to talk to if needed."
