SOUTH BEND -- A man who crashed while leading police on a motorcycle chase from Westville to Michigan City has died.

William Knies, 39, of Westville, died at Memorial Hospital in South Bend, two days after suffering a head injury.

LaPorte County police responded to an accident call about 1 a.m. Oct. 24 in Westville, then spotted Knies traveling above the speed limit on U.S. 421.

Police said they tried to stop Knies, who kept going. He eventually crashed when his motorcycle hit a curb on U.S. 421 near Ames Field in Michigan City.

Indiana State Police said Knies had a 0.28 percent blood-alcohol level, and THC, the key ingredient of marijuana, was found in his bloodstream.

According to his obituary, Knies was a veteran of the U.S. Navy and a union painter. A memorial visitation will be from 2 to 6 p.m. Central Time Saturday at Edmonds & Evans Funeral Home in Chesterton, Ind.
