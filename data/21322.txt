IONIA COUNTY -- June Chambers knows her son made a bad decision early Saturday when he fled from Lowell police on his motorcycle.

"He should have just taken his bumps and bruises. If they were going to take him off to jail, he should have gone," Chambers said today, grieving her son's death from a 3:15 a.m. crash on West Bluewater Highway near Pinckney Road.

Keith Chambers, 43, died after losing control of his motorcycle, then hitting a guardrail and a utility pole.

He was on his way home from work as a bouncer at an Alpine Township nightclub when a Lowell police officer tried to stop his motorcycle.

Chambers did not stop, police said, and instead accelerated before losing control of the motorcycle on a curve.

His mother today said she did not believe Chambers had a valid license. He also was behind on paying child support -- another reason he might have tried to elude police.

June Chambers described her son as a hard worker who loved his two children, Andrew, 9 and Jacob, 8.

"He adored them,"' she said.

She said the children are devastated and she expects family members to arrange for counseling.

In addition to the bouncer job, he also worked at Ventra, an auto-related manufacturer in Ionia.

Chambers was known by family as Bub, the nickname a sister gave him early in life because she could not say "brother."

Despite some flaws in his life, Chambers was kind to others and had many friends, his mother said.

"He was pretty willing to help anybody out who needed it," she said.

Funeral services are 11 a.m. Tuesday at Shiloh Community Church, 8197 Heth St., Orleans, MI. Arrangements are being handled by the Johnson-Feuerstein Funeral Home in Belding.

He is survived by his parents, June and Keith, two sisters and a brother.
