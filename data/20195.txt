ONALASKA, Wis. - La Crosse Police and the Wisconsin State Patrol are still investigating a rollover accident that killed a 33-year-old Galesville man Saturday night after a high-speed chase had been called off.

Danny M. Schiffler suffered fatal injuries after being thrown from his Chevy Tahoe at the Hwy. 53 northbound exit ramp to Sand Lake Road in Onalaska, according to the Wisconsin State Patrol.

The pursuit started shortly after 10 p.m. Saturday when a La Crosse officer tried to pull over a vehicle being driven recklessly on Hwys. 16 and 157 near Valley View Mall.

Schiffler stopped, but refused to roll down the window of his vehicle and then took off again.

Speeds reached 90 mph before the pursuit was called off for safety reasons. Although police stopped the pursuit, Schiffler continued driving at a high speed.

Officers saw his vehicle leave the road at the bottom of the Sand Lake Road exit ramp, where it rolled over several times. Schiffler was airlifted to Gundersen Lutheran Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.
