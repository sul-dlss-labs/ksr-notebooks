A Chicago man died Friday night after a police car that was chasing him pinned him against a wall on the South Side, authorities said Saturday. A police spokesman called the incident an accident.

The Cook County medical examiner's office identified the man as Curtis Collins, 24, of the 8000 block of South Throop Street. A spokesman with the office said the cause of death was still under investigation.

Police said Collins and another man were in the 8000 block of South May Street about 9 p.m. Friday when two police officers in a marked car tried to stop them on suspicion of drug charges.

"Both individuals took off," police spokesman Pat Camden said. "One officer chased on foot, another in the car."

Collins ran west onto Racine Avenue, then into a vacant lot at 8018 S. Racine, police said. The squad car jumped the curb to follow him, slid on wet grass and pinned Collins against a wall, Camden said.

Camden said the incident was an accident and Collins died at the scene.

Collins' family declined to comment.
