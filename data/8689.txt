Emmanuel Alvarez, a 27-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by West Covina police Thursday, Dec. 17, at South Azusa Avenue and East Greenville Drive in West Covina, authorities said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department homicide detectives are investigating the officer-involved shooting.

According to a sheriff's news release, West Covina police said the incident began when officers pulled over a car containing three men for possible vehicle code violations. The officers ordered Alvarez out of the back seat and were patting him down when, according to the release, the driver and front seat passenger got out of the car with handguns and ran down the street.

"The rear passenger then reached into his waistband and pulled a semi-automatic handgun," according to the release. "One officer shoved the suspect away to create distance, pulled his handgun and then shot the suspect twice in the upper torso."

Alvarez was shot about 2:47 p.m. and pronounced dead at the scene at 3:03 p.m., according to coroner's records.

Officers responding to the scene of the shooting arrested the two other men without incident. Their names were not released. Sheriff's officials said three guns were recovered from the men and another gun was discovered inside the car.
