A 53-year-old suicidal suspect shot by St. Johns County deputies last week after he fired a rifle at them has died, the Sheriff's Office said.

Cary Lloyd Martin fired at least eight rounds toward authorities after they thought he was ready to give up during a May 14 confrontaton at his Florida Avenue home in St. Augustine Beach, according to the Sheriff's Office. Sgt. Earl Edenfield III and Deputy Joshua Butler returned fire striking him multiple times. He had been hospitalized in critical condition.

Deputies were called to back up St. Augustine Beach police for a report of a despondent individual making suicidal threats. Officers made contact with Martin by phone and said he indicated he was going to come out to speak with them. He was armed with an M1-style rifle as he approached the front door and opened fire, the Sheriff's Office said.

Friends had said he had divorced and quit his job in the last few years and was living with his new girlfriend.

The investigation is continuing.
