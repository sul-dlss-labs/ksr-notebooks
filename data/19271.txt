Charleston County officials have released the name of the man who shot and killed himself in front of a sheriff's deputy earlier this week.

The Post and Courier of Charleston reported that the coroner's office said the man was 52-year-old Guy Glen of Edisto Island.

Sheriff's Maj. John Clark says the shooting occurred around 4 a.m. Monday while a deputy was investigating a wreck.

Clark says the deputy saw blood on the man and asked to see his hands. Clark says the man then pulled a gun and shot himself in the chest.
