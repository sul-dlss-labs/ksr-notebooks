PORT RICHEY — A man died Wednesday after at least one deputy used a Taser to subdue him, according to the Pasco County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies responded about 6:10 p.m. to a Home Depot at 10017 U.S. 19 after someone called to report a person who possibly had a “sidearm,” Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Amanda Hunter said in an email. A man who saw the responding deputies ran away. He went through traffic on U.S. 19 and “became combative” with deputies, Hunter said.

At least one deputy used a Taser to subdue the man and shortly after, he became unresponsive, Hunter said. Deputies administered first aid but he died at the scene. No weapon was found on the man.

Hunter declined to release the man’s name, age and the names of the deputies involved, citing an active investigation.
