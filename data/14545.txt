A city police officer will not face criminal charges in connection to the shooting death of 27-year-old Shiquan Malik Krouser, according to the Dutchess County District Attorney's Office.

The county grand jury chose not to indict two-year city police Officer Zachary McKinnon on Friday, the district attorney's office said. The information was released publicly on Wednesday.

Krouser, a city resident, was shot after he attacked city police Officer Renee Knapp with a box cutter on May 24, authorities said.

"â€¦This information is tantamount to a finding by the grand jury that Officer McKinnon's use of deadly physical force in the defense of police Officer Renee Knapp was justified under the circumstances," said Dutchess County District Attorney William V. Grady in a statement.

City police Capt. Thomas Pape said McKinnon will be returning to work from administrative leave shortly.

"Everybody feels bad when something like this happens for all parties involved," Pape said, adding the department expected the not found bill from the grand jury.

Toxicology reports indicate Krouser was under the influence of a "significant amount of methamphetamine" when he was shot, the district attorney's office said.

The shooting occurred at the intersection of Main and Academy streets. Krouser was "causing a disturbance, stopping cars, yelling and screaming," before he attacked Knapp with the box cutter, according to police.

Knapp, a seven-year department veteran, was badly injured by her attacker. She had to be hospitalized and required stitches to her face, according to Journal archives.

An autopsy indicated Krouser died from multiple gunshot wounds, according to Journal archives.
