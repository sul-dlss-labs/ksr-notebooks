Alfredo Valdivia, a 38-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by law enforcement officers on Tuesday, Oct. 31, in Cerritos.

Authorities said Valdivia had fatally wounded a woman, who they said were or had been married, in A the parking lot of a Cerritos auto insurance business.

No deputies were injured in the shootings, which occurred about 8 a.m. at Auto Insurance Specialists in the 17700 block of Center Court Drive.

Capt. Ray Peavy of the sheriff's Homicide Bureau said that the slaying appeared to have stemmed from domestic strife and that the man wanted deputies to kill him.

"It's unknown if he followed her here or if he was waiting for her," Peavy said.

"It appears that he shot her and waited for deputies to arrive. When they did, he engaged them in a gun battle."

At least four deputies returned fire and struck the man, Peavy said.

"He died in the parking lot just feet away from where he shot his victim," the captain said. "It would appear to be a murder and a suicide by cop. He waited for the cops to get there. He knew they would return [fire], which they did."
