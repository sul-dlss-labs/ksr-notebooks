One person is dead after police say a gun was fired inside a vehicle during a traffic stop in the Town of Brookfield early Saturday.

Officers were conducting the stop of the vehicle, which stopped in the parking lot of The Corners of Brookfield, a shopping center at 20111 W. Bluemound Road, according to a news release issued by Town of Brookfield police.

While approaching the vehicle, it said, an officer observed a single gunshot inside the vehicle and found one person with a gunshot wound. Police said they tried to save the person's life, but the person died from the injury.

Police said no officers discharged their weapons and no other people were injured in the incident. Several law enforcement agencies responded to the scene.

The Town of Brookfield Police Department requested the state Department of Justice to lead the investigation into the incident. The release did not explicitly describe the gunshot as self-inflicted and did not immediately respond to a request for clarification.

The lower level of the parking structure at The Corners was closed for police Saturday morning but had reopened by 10:30 a.m., according to the shopping center's Facebook page.
