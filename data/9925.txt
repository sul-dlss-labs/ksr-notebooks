LOCKPORT, KY (WAVE) - A Henry County, Ky. man is dead, after investigators say he took his grandmother hostage at gunpoint and charged at police.

Kentucky State Police Troopers and Henry County Deputies responded to a 911 call to 361 Sawmill Road just before midnight on March 2, where there were reports of an intoxicated man firing a gun into the air.

When officers arrived, they identified that person as Lewis Jennings, and found that he'd taken his grandmother hostage inside the home's bathroom.

Troopers and deputies then engaged in intense negotiations, attempting to peacefully resolve the situation. Family members who lived nearby arrived and also tried to persuade Jennings to end the situation without incident.

According to a news release from Kentucky State Police, Jennings emerged from the bathroom after 54 minutes of negotiations armed with a handgun and charged towards Trooper Manny Soto and Deputy Dean Murray. Deputy Murray tried to subdue Jennings with his taser, but the device did not make full contact.

Police say Jennings raised his handgun and fired at the officers, and that's when Trooper Soto and Deputy Murray returned fire, hitting and killing him.

Henry County Coroner Jimmy Pollard pronounced Jennings dead at the scene. An autopsy was set to be performed by the Medical Examiner's Office in Louisville.

Pursuant to KSP policy, Trooper Manny Soto has been placed on paid administrative leave. The Henry County Sheriff's office has also placed Deputy Dean Murray on paid administrative leave.

Trooper Soto is a 6-year veteran of KSP and Deputy Murray has been with the Henry County Sheriff's office for a year.

The ongoing investigation is being led by Detective Lieutenant Jeff Medley.
