A Brooklyn man who frequently had seizures that sent him running into traffic was shot and killed by police officers early yesterday morning when he swung at them with a light fixture, the authorities said.

The police did not immediately identify the man yesterday. But neighbors who gathered at Sutter and Sheffield Avenues in East New York identified him as Jose Feliciano, 44, a homeless man who stored his medicine in a friend's van.

According to the police, Mr. Feliciano attacked a 34-year-old woman as she stepped out of her building on Sutter Avenue shortly past 6 a.m., while the street was mostly deserted.

Mr. Feliciano swung at her with what appeared to be the long metal casing that covers the top of a fluorescent lighting fixture, but she was not injured, the police said.
