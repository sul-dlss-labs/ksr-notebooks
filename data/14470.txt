SAN BERNARDINO >> The fatal officer-involved shooting of Jose Raul Herrera by an Ontario police officer last year has been deemed justified by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office.

Officials in the District Attorney’s Office announced the decision Tuesday in a news release.

Police first encountered Jose Raul Herrera, 59, of Ontario shortly before midnight on May 10, 2014, after they were called to his home in the 900 block of North Placer Street to assist firefighters in a medical aid call.

It was the night before Mother’s Day.

Herrera’s son Ivan told 911 operators his father woke up and was being “belligerent” and not acting normal after a night of drinking, according to previous reports.

Dispatchers could hear Jose Herrera yelling in the background during the call, police said at the time.

Herrera was uncooperative and armed with a knife when the officer opened fire, police previously said.

According to the District Attorney’s Office findings, Herrera was belligerent and holding a knife in his right hand when the officers tried using non-lethal means to apprehend the man.

“Officer (Nick) Diaz ordered Jose Herrera to drop the knife,” the report said. “Jose Herrera failed to comply and continued to advance toward Officer Patric Birdsong.”

Diaz fired seven rounds from his weapon, striking Herrera four times and killing him.

Medical personnel pronounced Herrera dead at the scene.

According to the report, Herrera’s death was justified due to the right of police to use deadly force in the defense of themselves or others.
