FORT PAYNE, Alabama - A man was shot and killed Friday after allegedly pointing a firearm at a DeKalb County Sheriff's Deputy and an Alabama State Trooper.

At about 5 p.m. officers had spotted the man, later identified as Monroe Curtis Smith, of the Pea Ridge community, riding a four-wheeler on Highway 117 in the Ider area, according to the sheriff's department. When they approached him, Smith, described as "in his 40s," fled onto a secondary road and then drove through private property.

During the chase, officers saw Smith retrieve a firearm from the four-wheeler, according to a statement released Saturday by DeKalb County Sheriff Jimmy Harris. Smith's vehicle became blocked by tornado debris and he ran on foot.

Officers followed on foot. As they rounded a curve in the trail, Smith stood up and pointed his weapon at them, according to the sheriff's statement. When he refused orders to drop the weapon and continued to point it at the officers they fired at him.

The officers rendered CPR and aid until the DeKalb Ambulance Service took over, but Smith was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:13 p.m.

Sheriff Harris said the scene was secured and, per standard procedures, the matter has been turned over to the Alabama Bureau of Investigation. District Attorney Mike O'Dell has ordered an autopsy.

Harris said the deputy is on administrative leave with pay, which is policy in these matters, and that the office will rely on the ABI and await the findings. Because it is an open investigation, no other comment or details was provided.

"These are tragic circumstances for all parties involved," Harris said in the statement. "While I have sympathy for the family in this matter, I also have great concern for the officers and their safety. It's unfortunate. We always hope situations like this can be avoided."
