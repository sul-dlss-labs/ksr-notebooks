The family of Martina Brown, a Jersey City woman shot dead by police after she cut two officers with a kitchen knife wants to know why cops couldn't have subdued her another way.

"The way they killed her was savage," said Edith Sims, a cousin of Brown. Brown, 58, was shot six times by police in her Van Wagenen Avenue apartment last week.

Officials said police tried "non-lethal means" to subdue the woman, including wielding batons, but she continued to pose such a threat they had no choice but to shoot her.

Brown's family doesn't accept that explanation. They also believe the shooting was payback for the death of Emergency Services Unit officer Marc DiNardo, who was pronounced dead earlier that day. Detective DiNardo and four other officers were wounded in a shootout the previous week.
