BUCKINGHAM, Va. (AP) Â— The fatal police shooting of a 19-year-old man in rural Virginia is being investigated by the state police.

Virginia State Police spokeswoman Corinne Geller says Dyzhawn L. Perkins was shot Saturday by Buckingham County deputies after he physically attacked one of them.

The deadly encounter began shortly before 1 p.m. after state police responded to a store where Geller said Perkins had attacked two people. Geller said before the trooper arrived, Perkins had left the store and broke into a nearby residence and assaulted an elderly couple.

Buckingham County deputies later located Perkins at another address. Geller said when two deputies arrived at the residence, Perkins jumped through a window and attacked one of the deputies.

Geller said deputies fired at Perkins, who died at the scene.
