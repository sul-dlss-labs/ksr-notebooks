The arrest of a man on suspicion of driving while impaired led to a standoff at the Polk County Law Enforcement Center on Sunday morning, officials said.The Polk County Sheriff's Office said the standoff started around 4:57 a.m., when a deputy discovered a firearm on a man who had been arrested."On transport to the Polk County Jail Facility, the individual revealed to the officer he had a weapon," said Polk County Sheriff Timothy Wright. Deputies said the person was in a patrol car within the law enforcement facility's security fence."Deputies retreated from the vehicle because they saw the weapon, got out of the gated area, right there, and called for backup," said Wright. Several North Carolina law enforcement agencies arrived on the scene.Authorities said the person was asked multiple times to turn over the weapon to deputies. Deputies said after hours of negotiation, the man fatally shot himself.Authorities said the man is not from Polk County, but his name has not yet been released. Wright says officers were very upset it did not come to a peaceful ending. Now he hopes to figure out why the suspect had a gun inside the car."I will say that veteran officers were there, so I'm not going to second-guess them at this point in time," said Wright. Wright says once more information is gained, there may be repercussions for the deputies involved.
