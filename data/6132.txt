Juan Velasco, 30, a Latino man, was shot multiple times by an off-duty sheriff's deputy he had reportedly tried to rob in the 5900 block of Southside Drive. He died at 1:58 a.m. Friday, May 11.

The deputy was getting into his car to go home from an outing when he was confronted by two Latinos who demanded his keys and wallet, and beat him in the head with "a blunt object," sheriff's investigators said.

The deputy tried to identify himself; the beating continued. The deputy got his car door open, grabbed his gun, and shot one of the men, who died of his injuries. The second would-be robber ran away, and was caught and placed under arrest. The deputy suffered injuries to his head. He was treated at a hospital and released.
