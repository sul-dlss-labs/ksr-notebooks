Nestor Torres, a 37-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy Tuesday, Jan. 11, near Floral Drive and Brannick Avenue in East Los Angeles, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Sheriff's Deputy Mohamed Ahmed and his training officer, a 21-year-veteran, were on a routine patrol about 7:18 p.m. when they saw Torres and a woman inside a vehicle parked in the red zone.

The training officer recognized Torres, and as deputies got out of their cruiser, Torres got out of his car and allegedly fired at the officers, authorities said. Ahmed was shot in the face.

The training officer tried to wrestle the gun away from Torres, deflecting the weapon as it was pointed at his chest. The officer fired at least two shots, wounding Torres.

The woman with Torres, who was unhurt, was questioned and released, police said.

The two deputies and Torres were taken to the hospital after the incident. Torres was pronounced dead, while Ahmed was listed in critical but stable condition, said Nicole Nishida, a sheriff’s spokeswoman.

Ahmed’s training officer, who suffered abrasions and bruises, was treated and released from the hospital.

Torres, an East L.A. gang member, was on parole with prior felony convictions for shooting into an inhabited dwelling and possession of a firearm when he allegedly shot Ahmed, authorities said.
