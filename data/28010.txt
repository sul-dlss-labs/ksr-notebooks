JACKSON COUNTY, Mississippi -- A suicidal Pensacola, Fla., man led police on a chase from Mobile, Ala., into Jackson County Thursday morning and burned to death after crashing the car, which burst into flames.

According to Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell, Mobile police initiated the chase of 61-year-old Christopher Palmer in downtown Mobile about 6 a.m. Thursday.

Mobile police said officers attempted to stop Palmer’s vehicle about 5:11 a.m. after observing him operating his vehicle recklessly in on Government Street near South Royal Street.

Palmer refused to pull over and continued west on Government Street. At one point, Palmer stopped, officers approached and Palmer pulled a gun and pointed it at himself, causing officers to pull back.

Palmer continued on, driving west on Government toward Airport Boulevard at a high rate of speed. Spike strips were deployed on Airport to flatten three tires on Palmer’s vehicle, but he continued into Jackson County on Mississippi Highway 614.

Palmer ultimately ran off the roadway and into a wooded area. As officers approached, Palmer hit the accelerator of the disabled vehicle, which caused the underbrush to catch fire.

Officers repeatedly ordered Palmer to exit the vehicle, but he refused. Within moments, the vehicle was engulfed in flames.

Palmer remained in the vehicle and died. As of Thursday afternoon, his body was still inside the vehicle as Jackson County firefighters worked to extinguish the blaze.

The incident caused the closure of Highway 614 west of Stateline Road and east of Frank Snell Road until about 8:30 a.m., when one lane of the highway was reopened. As of mid-afternoon Thursday, it was unknown if the entire roadway had reopened.

Ezell said the case will be handled by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the Mobile Police Department.
