PARMA, Ohio -- The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner’s Office has identified the 47-year-old Parma man who was shot to death by police officers in a SWAT standoff.

John Vik died in the incident that started about 8:45 p.m. Monday on Edgehill Drive just south of Snow Road in Parma Heights, Parma police spokesman Lt. Dan Ciryak said.

Parma Heights police responded to a report that a man, later identified as Vik, pointed a gun at another man’s head, police reports say. Vik drove away and headed to his home in Parma.

Parma police came in to assist Parma Heights police and scoured the Liggett Road area where they found Vik’s truck. Vik barricaded himself inside of a home when police tried to talk to him, police reports say.

The Southwestern Enforcement Bureau tactical team came to the scene and negotiators tried to convince Vik to come out of the home and surrender.

Police said that Vik walked out of the house about 2:30 a.m. Tuesday and fired shots at the officers. Officers fired back and struck Vik at the front door to his home, police said.

Police say they do not have any footage of the incident as tactical officers do not wear body cameras or have dashboard cameras in their cruisers.

The Ohio Attorney General’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation is investigating this incident.

Parma police said at least one of the department’s officers fired shots and has been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. He still has not said how many officers shot at Vik.
