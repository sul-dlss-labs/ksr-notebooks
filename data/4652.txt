A police sergeant yesterday shot and killed a 19-year-old man who was waving a long kitchen knife after a fight on a sidewalk in the Tremont section of the Bronx, the police said.

The shooting occurred shortly after 2 a.m. outside 2205 Creston Avenue, according to the police. A lieutenant, a sergeant and an officer had responded to a report of gunshots and, finding no witnesses or victims, were leaving when they noticed a crowd on Creston Avenue.

The sergeant was in uniform, while the lieutenant and officer were in plainclothes. They split up, with the sergeant and officer approaching the crowd of about 15 people from one side and the lieutenant from the other. They saw a man making stabbing motions with a knife in his hand, the police said. The man with the knife and a second man appeared to be assaulting a third man. The second man was questioned by the police and released without charges. The third man ran away and has not come forward, the police said.

The man with the knife waved it at the police officer, and the sergeant fired a shot, the police said. The man then waved the knife at the sergeant, and he fired again, striking him in the abdomen, the police said. It was unclear whether the first round had also struck the man.
