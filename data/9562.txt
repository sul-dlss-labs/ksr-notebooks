James Ramirez, a 33-year-old Latino, died in an officer-involved shooting Friday, Oct. 22, near 9th Street and Broadway in Santa Monica, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Authorities responded to a shooting call in the rear of 1345 7th Street about 6:10 p.m., according to a Santa Monica Police Department news release. Callers said a man, later identified by officials as James Ramirez, shot a female several times and then fled on foot.

When officers arrived, they found the female victim conscious but suffering from gunshot wounds to the head and upper torso, police said. The woman told authorities her husband had shot her. She was taken to a hospital, where she remains in critical condition.

According to the preliminary investigation, the woman was shot while seated in her parked vehicle and subsequently attempted to escape on foot. Ramirez continued to attack her, shooting her several more times. Witnesses said Ramirez momentarily pointed the gun at himself. He then placed the gun in his waistband and ran southbound on 7th Street toward Santa Monica Boulevard, police said.

After the shooting, two officers located Ramirez as he was running northbound on 9th Street from Broadway. They ordered him to stop as he was running toward them. He refused to obey the officerâ€™s commands, retrieved a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at them, they said. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred, which led to Ramirez's death.
