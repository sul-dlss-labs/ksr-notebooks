AKRON, Ohio – A 62-year-old Akron man died Tuesday of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head during a six-hour standoff with police at his apartment in the city’s Kenmore neighborhood, according to the Summit County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Paul Coteat was found dead after SWAT officers entered his apartment on the first floor of a two-story building on the 1200 block of Wilbeth Road, according to police and the medical examiner’s office.

The incident began around 10 a.m. Tuesday when an Akron Municipal Court bailiff tried to evict Coteat, according to police. Coteat was late on his rent, so a magistrate had granted his landlord’s request for an eviction, court records show.

A spokeswoman for North Hill Rentals, which owns the apartment building, declined to comment on this story.

Coteat refused to leave his apartment and threatened that he had a gun, according to police.

The bailiff called for police, who evacuated the building and brought in negotiators to de-escalate the situation. Coteat fired a shot at the officers, but no one was struck, police said.

Officers called for SWAT teams, including from Akron police, Summit County Sheriff’s Office and the State Highway Patrol. The teams negotiated with Coteat for a few hours.

Coteat fired additional shots at officers, and the SWAT teams fired about a dozen canisters of tear gas into the apartment, police said.

Around 4:20 p.m., officers looked inside and saw a man who appeared unresponsive on the floor of the living room. They used a robot to detonate a device that broke open the front door, and found Coteat, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police officers did not fire at Coteat during the standoff.
