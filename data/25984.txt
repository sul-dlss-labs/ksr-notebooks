A man who hijacked a DART bus Sunday and led police on a chase through North Texas fired more than 70 rounds at officers before he was fatally shot, police said.

Officers shot 31-year-old Ramon Thomas Villagomez nearly an hour after the chase through Richardson, Garland, Rowlett and Rockwall began.

Only one passenger remained aboard when the vehicle arrived at a Dallas Area Rapid Transit station in Garland, police said. There, Villagomez took control of the bus and directed the driver where to go.

The bus continued east on Highway 66 into Rockwall. Police from that city tried to stop the bus by using spike strips, but it made a U-turn and traveled west to Rowlett, police said.

Officers followed onto the George Bush Turnpike, and a Garland officer was shot in the neck after Villagomez fired through the windshield of a patrol car.

The bus stopped near Liberty Grove Road in Rowlett, and Villagomez escaped through a window and tried to run with the gun, but police shot him. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.

Officials recovered a handgun, four loaded magazines and boxes of ammunition, according to a news release.

Officials said Villagomez’s gunfire struck eight police cars, a marked security vehicle and a civilian vehicle.

Garland police are investigating the hijacking with help from the Texas Rangers, officials said.

The officers’ wounds were not life-threatening, authorities said. The bus driver and passenger were not injured. A third officer from Rowlett who was initially reported injured was not hurt in the pursuit, spokesman Cruz Hernandez said Monday.

Gunman not from area

Garland police spokesman Pedro Barineau said Villagomez was not from the Dallas area.

Officials said Sunday that he had been wanted for questioning in San Antonio in connection with the fatal stabbing of his girlfriend, 41-year-old Catherine Menendez, whose body was found April 7.

San Antonio police didn’t respond to requests for comment Monday, but they said Sunday that a murder warrant had not been issued for Villagomez in connection with Menendez’s death.

Villagomez also faced an arrest warrant for an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge in Brazoria County after he was accused of assaulting a relative.
