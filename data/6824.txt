A man killed by deputies Friday after stealing a patrol car and running over a deputy’s foot was identified Sunday as Hector Antonio Quirartemedrano, 22, of Sacramento.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Department said Quirartemedrano jumped into the patrol car after deputies approached him as a “suspicious person” Friday evening.

He drove over the deputy’s foot as he tried to get away. The deputies opened fire, and the car hit a light pole.
