SIMMS, Texas -- A man shot by a Bowie County Sheriff's Deputy during a standoff has died.

The Sheriff's Office received notification Sunday that Mark Robert Peters, 60, of Simms, Texams died as a result of his injuries, said BCSO Sheriff Jeff Neal. The Texas Rangers will continue to be the lead investigating agency of this incident, Neal said.

Peters was airlifted to a Tyler, Texas, hospital Friday afternoon after a standoff with law enforcement.

Bowie County Sheriff's Office responded shortly before noon Friday to 6588 Farm to Market 44 in Simms, Texas, regarding a suicidal person, according to the dispatch. Once there, deputies attempted to make contact with Peters. Peters allegedly fired one shot from inside of the home and then refused to come outside, threatening deputies in the process.

Deputies retreated to a safer distance and negotiated with Peters in efforts of finding a peaceful resolution. On one occasion, Peters exited the home and fired the weapon, before returning back inside the home. Negotiations continued for several hours but Peters eventually exited the home again, still carrying the weapons.

According to BCSO accounts, Peters walked through the front yard and allegedly turned towards deputies that were on the scene, placing them in imminent danger.

A single shot was fired by a Bowie County Sheriff's deputy that struck Peters. Medical attention was immediately provided. Peters was then taken by LifeNet ambulance to Titus Regional Medical Center before eventually being airlifted to the University of Texas-Tyler Hospital. Peters' condition was critical late Friday.

Texas Parks and Wildlife, DeKalb Police Department and Texas Department of Transportation assisted BCSO.
