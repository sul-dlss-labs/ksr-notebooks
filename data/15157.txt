Warren County Sheriff's officials have identified the driver of a vehicle that crashed Monday along County Line Road following a short chase.

The driver was Yanik Nicholas Audain, 29, of Des Moines. He was pronounced dead at the crash scene, which was not the first involving Audain and a stolen car.

The vehicle Monday was a silver Mercedes Benz, which had been reported stolen between 8:30 and 9 a.m. from a residence in the 8200 block of Leisure Lane.

A Warren County Deputy traveling westbound on County Line Road, saw the vehicle pass him, according to a news release. The deputy, who was identified as Randy Spurr, turned his vehicle around and attempted to catch up with the Mercedes Benz, the release said.

Before Spurr caught up with the fleeing vehicle, it crashed, officials said on Monday. The chase lasted less than a minute.

The stolen vehicle hit an embankment in a private driveway, flipped, and came to rest facing the opposite way it was traveling, officials said. The vehicle caught fire after the crash, officials said.

Des Moines police and firefighters were called to the scene as were Iowa State Patrol and Warren County Sheriff's Department officers. The accident is under investigation by the Iowa State Patrol.

In February 2006, Audain was involved in a similar high-speed chase with a stolen vehicle on Interstate Highway 80 near Muscatine, according to a story in the Muscatine Journal.

The report says that chase ended with a crash after Audain jumped a sidewalk and drove into a ravine. He escaped the scene but was later arrested on multiple felony charges.

Iowa court records show an extensive criminal record for Audain over the past 10 years, including convictions for domestic assault with intent or display of a weapon, first- and second-degree harassment, attempted burglary and possession of drug paraphernalia.
