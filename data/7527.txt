Hickory Creek police are investigating the death of a prisoner in their custody last week.



Hickory Creek Sgt. Bobby Starnes said officers arrested Joshua Ivy, 26, of Kamay, Texas, about noon Wednesday.



The arrest took place in the 600 block of Denton Drive in Hickory Creek, Starnes said, and Ivy was charged with being in possession of drug paraphernalia, a misdemeanor offense.



"When the officer left the scene of the arrest, after about a mile he started being combative, hitting his head on the Plexiglass barrier," Starnes said. "At that time, he was not showing any medical signs, just signs of a combative prisoner."



By the time the officer arrived at Denton County Jail, Ivy was demonstrating signs of medical distress, Starnes said. Jailers called 911 and Denton paramedics, accompanied by the Hickory Creek officer, took him to Denton Regional Medical Center, where he was declared dead.



"The investigation is pending toxicology reports from the medical examiner," the sergeant said. "And that will take several weeks."



According to Denton County Jail records, Ivy has a criminal record that includes two arrests for aggravated robbery in Collin County, and arrests for burglary, engaging in organized criminal activity and delivery of a controlled substance in Denton County.
