Two rounds were fired from a

handgun into the Inkster Police

Station on South River Park Drive

just beforemidnight last Friday.

There were no injuries report-

ed in the shooting and police said

that one bullet pierced the glass

doors and struck a wall in the

vestibule and another was stopped

by themetal door frame.

Police said that a group of

about six witnesses arrived at the

station at about 11:50 p.m. claim-

ing they wanted to file a report

about a stolen puppy. The group

told the two officers on duty that

they had attempted to recover the

animal when the man whom they

believed had the dog tried to run

their car off the road. The witness-

es got no further in their story

before two shots rang out from a

vehicle stopped in front of the sta-

tion, police said.

After the two shots, the vehicle,

anSUV, was driven off.

Police broadcast a description

of the vehicle provided by the wit-

nesses and a Garden City police

patrol quickly identified the SUV

at Middlebelt and Cherry Hill

roads. When the Garden City offi-

cers attempted a traffic stop, using

lights and siren, the vehicle began

to slow and drift to the side of the

road, toward the curb, according

to police reports of the incident.

Police surmise that the suspect

shot himself in the head when the

officers attempted to stop his vehi-

cle.

The suspect was dead at the

scene with a single bullet wound

to the head which police believe

was self-inflicted. His name and or

age are not being released, police

said.

The investigation into the death

is now being handled by the

Michigan State Police while

Inkster detectives are handling

the probe into the shooting at the

police station.

The six witnesses told police

that they knew of the dead man

but were not personally acquaint-

ed with him. They said they

believed the stolen puppy was

given to the deceased as payment

for a debt by a thirdpartywho they

believe took the animal.

State police were not releasing

any information regarding the

investigation.

The board of trustees

approved a $54,000 market

Andrea Deanna Brennen, 37,

has been sentenced to 5 years pro-

bation following her guilty plea to

a charge of using a computer to

commit a crime in sending a top-

less photo of herself to an under-

ageVanBurenTownshipboy.

Brennan, of Ypsilanti, a former

North Middle School teacher, was

originally charged with selling/fur-

nishing alcohol to aminor and dis-

tributing obscene matter to a

child. The charges followed her

arrest July 10, 2012 after she was

found at 1:30 a.m. in a parked car

near the softball fields at Beck and

Ayes roads in Van Buren

Township with a 15-year-old boy.

The car was noticed by Van Buren

police on routine patrol in the

area.

Officers reported that Brennan

and the juvenile were consuming

alcohol. Brennan was arrested

and the boy taken into custody and

his parents notified. He was

released into their custody that

same night.

A search warrant for Brennan's

phone records showed that she

and the juvenile had been text

messaging and included the sexu-

ally explicit photo of herself she

sent to his cell phone. The teen

had never been a student in any of

Brennan's classes, according to

police reports.

The original charges against

Brennan were dismissed in

exchange for her guilty plea to the

computer crime. The sentencing

agreement also requires her to

register as a sex offender and her

name will remain on the state list

for the next 25 years. She must

also continue twice-a-month sex

offender counseling with psy-

chotherapist Matthew Rosenberg,

as directedby the court.

During her 5-year probation,

Brennan can have no contact with

the 15-year-old involved and no

unsupervised visits with children

under the age of 16. She cannot

reside, work or loiter within 1,000

feet of a school. Judge Edward

Ewell, Jr. did allow a variance

Teacher sentenced to probation on sex charge

Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. to be honored Monday

SamWalton has learned a lot of valuable les-

sons during his three years producing the

Plymouth IceFestivals.

The most important ones were taught by

Mother Nature. After enduring bone-chilling

cold one year and working in shorts and a t-shirt

in 60-degree sunshine another, he's prepared for

whatever shemay do.

“This year, whether it is 8 degrees or 80

degrees outside, there is something for everyone

to do and see,”Walton said.

This is his fourth year at the helm of the festi-

val and he said he was determined to make the

festival more interactive and appealing to all

ages. “I wanted something more than just ice

carvings people could look at. They are beauti-

ful, no doubt about it, but I wanted to give people

a chance to interact, to do things, to actively par-

ticipate,” he said.

His plans include a huge ice skating rink in

Kellogg Park this year, which is free to anyone

who wants to skate, as are the skates, which are

furnished.

This year, the Grind Rail where snowboard-

ers can practice and compete has been expand-

ed. It will be installed, with snow, near E.G.

Nick's PartyTent onForest Avenue.

“This is free, too,” Walton said. “We are going

to have some competitions for cash prizes and if

the riders want to compete, they need to pay an

entry fee, otherwise, they ride for free,” he said.

The ice carving competitions are free as are

the cross-country ski lessons and demonstra-

tions. “That are, too, has been expanded and it

is…free.”

For the first time in the history of the festival,

it is not a city controlled event. Walton, through

his Signature Professional Group, is solely

responsible for the planning and execution of

the festival.

“I take that very seriously,” he said. “This

event brings 100,000 people into Plymouth and

the impression they leave with, of the city, of the

community, is a pretty big deal,” he said. “I want

this to be the best it canbe.”

“We've got a good mix of attractions. Not just

things for people to be looking at, but something

for people to do. This is an interactive event and

thanks to our sponsors, everything is free to the

public.

“This year we have amazing creations and

interactive sculptures that people can touch and

feel and get close too,”Walton said.

The ice throne and the ice bench will be back

for photo opportunities, too, he said.

MGMGrand is the sponsor of the Party Lot in

E.G.Nick's parking lot this year. One of the tradi-

tions of the Ice Festival every year, the Party Lot

has become the place to be for the evening

crowd. The entertainment is always a big draw,

Walton said, and the place is where the in-crowd

goes during the event. TheParty Lot will be open

from 6 p.m. until midnight on both Friday and

Saturday.

“If there's no ice or snow, we'll have some

trucked in. If we can't carve ice, we have a pro-

fessional woodcarverwhowill carve.

“No matter what the weather, this will be a

great festival,”Walton said.

(A complete schedule of activities at the festival

is included in the Official Ice Festival Program

inserted in this edition of TheEagle.)
