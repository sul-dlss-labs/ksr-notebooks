A man who was shot by Mesa police officers during a confrontation outside a Circle K store has died, police said Thursday.

Mesa police identified the man as Kelvin Baldwin, 30, who was suspected of violating a protection order that his estranged wife had gotten.

Baldwin had threatened his wife and told her he would hurt police officers if she reported him, according to Mesa police.

Officers had obtained a warrant for his arrest and two undercover officers followed a vehicle in which he was a passenger to the store at Baseline and Greenfield roads on Wednesday afternoon, police said.

As Baldwin left the store, the officers approached him to make an arrest. Baldwin ran through the parking lot, then reached for a handgun that was in his waistband and began shooting at the officers, according to Mesa police.

He managed to fire at least two shots but no officers were hit, police said. One officer responded by deploying a Taser, but a second officer returned gunfire and struck Baldwin, Mesa police said.

The officers involved were not identified by police, but no officers were injured.
