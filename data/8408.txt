My father (posting his full name mainly for reference so you all can google and see this is a true story) Tommy Wayne Baird jr was brutally beaten (held down, boot heel prints on each wrist, broken nose, sub dural brain bleeds, bruises all over his body, tased in the neck and chest with no defensive wounds, etc) and killed at the age of 49 by 4 Canton, MS police officers (of which 15 minutes of the killing was on Facebook live) after passing up an inspection sticker checkpoint and being followed for several miles while on his way to Jackson, Mississippi to get his PTSD medication from the VA clinic. He served two tours in Iraq and medically retired because of his post traumatic stress disorder. My father would never fight police and he did anything and everything for people; he would give you the shirt off his back if that's what it took. The articles in Mississippi news have slandered and made my father out to be a monster but he wasn’t. I’m posting here mainly for legal advice but any advice from anyone would be greatly appreciated.
