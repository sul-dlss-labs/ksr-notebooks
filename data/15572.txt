Mayra Cornejo, a 34-year-old Latina, was shot and killed by Los Angeles Sheriff’s Deputies Wednesday, Dec. 31 in the 100 block of West Compton Boulevard in Compton, according to authorities.

Deputies responded to a gas station about 4:30 p.m. regarding a report of a person with a gun, said Lt. Eddie Hernandez with the sheriff’s department.

Cornejo had arrived at the gas station with a gun that was registered to her husband and was furious over criminal allegations that the man was facing, Hernandez said.

The man had just been released from jail and Cornejo found him near a pay phone. She allegedly fired once at the man and the bullet grazed his shirt. He took the weapon from her and placed it on a nearby counter, but authorities said Cornejo grabbed the gun again.

When deputies arrived, Cornejo and the man were standing 2 to 3 feet from each other. Deputies yelled for Cornejo to drop the weapon and she refused.

Deputies at the scene said that Cornejo looked as though she was trying to fire the weapon. Fearing for the man’s safety, they opened fire on Cornejo, who died at the scene.

Cornejo was a mother of five who was described as outgoing and cheery. “She wanted to help out everyone,” said her sister, Violet Cornejo.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
