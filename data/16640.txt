A man fatally shot by a Talladega County sheriff's deputy was a state prison inmate who escaped nearly two months ago, authorities said today.

The Alabama Department of Corrections identified the inmate as 23-year-old Derick Davis. Davis was serving a three-year sentence on a 2015 drug possession conviction out of Talladega County.

The shooting happened about 1:45 p.m. Saturday near the intersection of Woodlawn Avenue and West 8th Street in Mill Village area of Sylacauga, near B.B. Comer High School. Authorities have not released details surrounding the deadly shooting.

The deputy was not injured. A post on the Sylacauga Police Facebook page over the weekend asked "all of you to keep this deputy in your prayers."

DOC officials today said Davis left a transitional facility without approval on July 17. He was assigned to the Supervised Re-entry Program at the time of his escape. He was sentenced in Jan. 2015 as a youthful offender, and was serving his sentence in the transitional facility as an alternative to prison.

The DOC said the program allows inmates to serve their sentence in a community-based transitional facility, or residential housing with approved supervision. The facilities offer inmates rehabilitative services, substance abuse treatment, employment and education assistance to help them transition back into society, according to a DOC new release.

Officials said they have been searching for Davis since his escape. The State Bureau of Investigation is the lead agency investigating the shooting.
