A Detroit officer fatally struck a bicyclist late Wednesday while responding to an unrelated call in Highland Park, according to Detroit police.

The collision occurred around 11 p.m. at Oakland and Davison, department spokeswoman Jennifer Watson said. The officer was traveling northbound, through a green light on Oakland, when he struck a bicyclist attempting to cross the road against the red light at Davison.

"The scout car had lights and sirens on, responding to a call in the area," Watson said.

The bicyclist, a man in his 20s, died from his injuries. No further information was available Thursday on the status of the officer.

"We're still conducting an investigation," Watson said.
