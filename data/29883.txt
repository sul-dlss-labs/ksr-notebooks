Yakima Police say a man killed himself after a pursuit on Wednesday that ended in Naches. Capt. Jay Seely says officers were first called to the Taco Bell at 16th and Nob Hill Blvd. at about 5:10 p.m. for a report of a woman who had been assaulted. Officers found a 22-year-old woman at the restaurant who told them she had been assaulted by a former boyfriend from Longview who had stolen her car. She told police the 41-year-old former boyfriend showed up at her place of business in the area of 40th and Nob Hill and asked her for a ride and she complied. Soon after getting into the vehicle the man asked her to pull into a parking lot in the area of 16th and Nob Hill.

That's when police say the man started to assault the woman and placed her hands in zip ties. She was able to open a door and run to the nearby Taco Bell where the doors were locked because of COVID-19. An employee let her in the restaurant and the suspect took off in her vehicle. About 30 minutes later Yakima Police spotted the vehicle and a chase started. A Yakima County Sheriff's Deputy joined the pursuit and rammed the suspect vehicle but the chase continued. The pursuit went through Selah, Selah Loop Rd, South Wenas Rd, Naches Wenas Rd, and ended near the intersection of Old Naches Hwy and Cherry in Naches. The suspect finally stopped the vehicle in that area, pulled out a gun and killed himself.

The woman was taken to a hospital where she was treated and released. No officers were injured.

The investigation continues Today.
