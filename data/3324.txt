Hundreds of prisoners could be returned to Shasta County

By Ryan Sabalow Thursday, August 6, 2009

Nearly 400 state prisoners eventually could return to Shasta County after three federal judges this week ruled to release a quarter of California's inmates. Saying overcrowding and poor health care at the state's 33 adult prisons violated inmates' constitutional rights, the judges Tuesday gave prison officials 45 days to free some 40,000 of the state's nearly 150,000 inmates. About 8,000 additional inmates have been sent to prisons in other states, while nearly 10,000 more are in conservation camps and community correctional facilities. About 1,500 Shasta County inmates are included in the state's prison population. Should a quarter of those inmates be released, Shasta County could see nearly 400 inmates return, according to a Record Searchlight analysis of state prison records. Tehama County could see about 125 of its nearly 500 inmates return. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said Wednesday that releasing sentenced inmates will take away accountability from the state's justice system. "While disturbing, I'm not surprised by it," Bosenko said, noting that lawsuits alleging prison health care violations have been ongoing for several years. In a statement, Assemblyman Jim Nielsen, R-Gerber, said the release of this massive number of unrehabilitated inmates will impose "equally massive victimization upon society." Nielsen, a former deputy commissioner of the California Board of Prison Terms, said Californians should be "justifiably outraged" at the judges' ruling. But he said the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation also is responsible for "17 years of stonewalling in the face of several inmate lawsuits" by CDCR officials. Attempts to improve health care or alleviate overcrowding "vanished in the near terrestrial black hole of CDCR's entrenched bureaucracy," Nielsen said. CDCR spokesman Seth Unger responded that the CDCR was "making a lot of progress" in solving its overcrowding woes. "Nothing happens overnight," Unger said. "All these things take time." Among other improvements, more readily available medical care and a push to hire more doctors and nurses have greatly helped reduce preventable deaths, he said. The CDCR also recently won court cases that will allow bond financing to pay for new facilities, Unger said. Unger also noted that prison officials already had been working on inmate reductions after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger last month ordered the CDCR to find ways to release 27,300 inmates to trim $1.2 billion from the state's budget. Proposed plans included home GPS monitoring for some low-risk offenders, reducing the level of parole supervision for others, deporting some imprisoned illegal immigrants and changing some property crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. In their 184-page order, the judges maintained that even billions of dollars spent on prisons has not kept inmates from dying regularly from suicides or medical neglect. Responding to lawsuits, federal courts previously found the level of care was so poor that it violated inmates' constitutional rights. Conditions remain so cramped that violence has increased and infectious diseases spread quickly, the judges said. "The medical and mental health care available to inmates in the California prison system is woefully and constitutionally inadequate, and has been for more than a decade," the judges wrote. The judges' ruling is likely to be appealed by prison officials and Republican leaders. Bosenko said he and other law enforcement officials around the state had been wondering, even before the judge's order, whether any of the governor's proposed inmate shifts would place burdens on shrinking city and county police forces or whether the state would try to funnel any prisoners into already overcrowded county jails. Earlier this year, Shasta County jailers closed a floor of their jail, cutting by a third the number of inmates. "I don't want to accept inmates from other counties or state prison," Bosenko said.

ORDER Within 45 days, defendants shall provide the court with a population reduction plan that will in no more than two years reduce the population of the CDCR�s adult institutions to 137.5% of their combined design capacity. Should any of defendants� proposed population reduction measures require the waiver of any provisions of state law, the state shall so advise the court, and shall explain why the requested waiver is permissible under 18 U.S.C. § 3626(a)(1)(B). In preparing their plan, defendants shall consult with plaintiffs, intervenors, and other relevant stakeholders, including the Coleman Special Master and the Plata Receiver. Should such consultation fail to resolve any objections to the proposed population reduction plan, plaintiffs and intervenors shall file their objections no more than 20 days after defendants file their proposed plan, and defendants shall file responses to such objections no more than 10 days thereafter. Defendants shall set forth in their proposal the effective dates of the various actions they propose to undertake and their estimate of the reduction in population they expect to achieve after six, twelve, eighteen, and twenty-four months. The court will consider all of the written submissions and make any necessary modifications or changes to defendants� proposed plan before issuing a population reduction plan as an order of the court. The court may before doing so request clarification on any matters and conduct any further hearings it deems necessary. However, given that this court issued a preliminary ruling on this matter almost six months ago so as to �give the parties notice of the likely nature of [this] opinion, and [] allow them to plan accordingly,� Feb. 9, 2009 Tentative Ruling at 1, the court will look with disfavor upon any effort to postpone or delay an expeditious resolution of the terms of the population reduction plan, including the submission of a proposed plan by the state and the issuance of the order adopting the final plan. The court will not grant any stay of the proceedings prior to the issuance of the final population reduction plan, but will entertain motions to stay implementation of that plan pending the resolution of any appeal to the Supreme Court. We will retain jurisdiction over this matter to ensure compliance with the population reduction plan and to consider any subsequent modifications made necessary by changed circumstances.





Redding man sues state over religious drug treatment program

A Redding man filed a lawsuit in federal court Monday, claiming his rights as an atheist were violated when he was ordered to take part in a 12-step drug treatment program that taught reliance on a higher power. Barry A. Hazle, Jr., 40, was found to have violated terms of his parole and sent to prison for 125 days after he formally complained about the program, according to his attorneys. His legal problems began with a 2004 felony conviction on methamphetamine possession. He was placed on parole in February 2007 and ordered to complete a 90-day live-in drug treatment program at Empire Recovery Center in Redding. Hazle said he requested a non-religious program. When it became clear the program at Empire included religious content, he spoke to officials there about enrolling in a secular program, he said. �It had a religious component I wasn�t comfortable with,� he said. Empire officials told him he needed to take up his complaint with his parole officer, Mitch Crofut, Hazle said. Hazle complained to Crofut, who told Hazle to fill out a state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation complaint form after he found no secular drug treatment program was offered locally. Hazle filled out the form, asking to be placed in a secular treatment program, Hazle said. Three days later, �I was taken out of class and taken back to prison,� Hazle said. He had already served a year and a half in prison, a sentence that later was overturned on appeal. Hazle said as Crofut was leading him out of class, he told Hazle he was going to make an example of him. On the way out, Hazle said he told Crofut he�d withdraw his complaint if it meant he could avoid going back to prison. He said Crofut told him it was too late. Crofut on Monday declined to comment on the lawsuit. �I don�t know that I can make a comment on anything,� Crofut said. He referred calls to the Department of Corrections� press information officer. The spokesman there declined to comment until he had time to review the lawsuit. Hazle is arguing his first amendment rights were violated for being required to enroll in a religious-type treatment program with no other treatment option and then sent back to prison for complaining about it. Hazle is the son of Record Searchlight City Editor Maline Hazle. He�s suing for damages and for the court to order the Department of Corrections to make secular drug treatment programs available to parolees. �Ultimately, we�d like to see the California Parole Board stop doing these kinds of things,� said Michael Scheibli. �I think this (the state's treatment requirement) is about as aggressive as it gets.� The initial court ruling, which was the basis for Hazle�s original incarceration, was overturned by the California Court of Appeal in November. When Hazle was first convicted of methamphetamine possession, he was placed on probation rather than sent to state prison, court records show. State law since passage of Proposition 36 allows drug offenders three chances to stay clean before they�re sent to prison. Hazle had failed the court-mandated drug tests twice, according to court documents provided by his attorneys. After failing the second drug test, officers came to his house to give him a summons to appear in court. They found an unopened bottle of whiskey, Hazle said. Officers then arrested Hazle, treating the discovery of the whiskey as his third offense, court records show. He appeared in court and was sent to state prison, documents show. Hazle appealed the ruling and won, with the State Court of Appeal finding Shasta County Superior Court had violated due process by sending him to prison on a third offense before the second offense had been presented to the court.

Confidential jail call heard Attorney: Cases compromised; official cites 'technical error' By Ryan Sabalow

Sunday, August 10, 2008

An unidentified inmate makes a phone call inside the Shasta County jail last week. In California, it�s a felony to eavesdrop without permission on inmates� phone conversations with attorneys, doctors, psychologists or clergy.

One day in March, 26-year-old Shasta County jail inmate Michael Aaron Jayne made what he thought was a confidential call to his attorney to talk about a pending case. She wasn't there, so he left a message on her voice mail, court documents show. What Jayne didn't know was that jail employees would later listen to the one-way conversation. His attorney claimed the recording was used as evidence to punish him, and the recorded message was used as the basis for a request to throw out a stalking and harassment case. His jailers' discovery came courtesy of an automated electronic phone system that records inmate conversations -- one similar to automatic-recording systems in jails around the country. The recording systems have been causing defense attorneys to worry about their constitutionally protected right to confidential conversations with their clients. "A defense attorney can't do their job without the absolute trust of their client," said Cynthia Campbell, one of Jayne's Redding defense attorneys. "If their client believes that the government or law enforcement is listening in on those privileged - sacred - phone calls, then we won't be able to effectively communicate, and a valid and proper defense can't be had." Local jail officials contend Jayne's case was merely a glitch in a system that since has been fixed. They contend they listened to the recording only because it wasn't made clear that Jayne had called an attorney's line. "I don't want to say it was much ado about nothing," sheriff's Capt. Don Van Buskirk said. "But it was a technical error, and that's all it was." Van Buskirk also maintains that the one-way conversation was never used to punish Jayne, and it was the only privileged call ever heard by jail employees. In rejecting Jayne's request to have the case dismissed, a retired Shasta County Superior Court judge ruled that the recording violated Jayne's Sixth Amendment rights, but it wasn't intentional. A fundamental right Discussions between attorneys and their clients are among the most highly protected communications in the legal system. In California, it's a felony for anyone to eavesdrop without permission on inmates' phone calls with attorneys, doctors, psychologists and clergy. But in the past two years, privileged conversations between inmates and lawyers have been recorded in San Diego, Alameda, Santa Clara and Riverside counties in California, as well as Broward County, Fla.; Lansing, Mich.; and Dallas. Jail systems have long recorded inmate calls to screen for illegal behavior or investigate crimes. But before automated systems were introduced two decades ago, deputies could switch off the tape if an inmate called a lawyer. Newer digital systems automatically turn off the recorder if an inmate dials a number included in a database compiled by authorities, who typically rely on directories published by local bar associations to identify lawyers. That means calls may be improperly recorded if the databases are incomplete or out of date. At the Shasta County jail, all calls to anyone but attorneys are recorded, Van Buskirk said. To ensure confidentiality, a defense attorney must notify jail officials in advance that they will be receiving calls from inmates. He said those calls are confidential and don't cost money to dial. But calls to doctors, clergy and psychologists are treated no differently from any other call and recorded, Van Buskirk said. The recordings are hardly secret, he said. A message warns inmates and those they call collect that their conversations may be recorded and monitored. If someone doesn't want their call recorded, all they have to do is hang up, Van Buskirk said. Similar messages are played to inmate callers around the country, but many defense attorneys believe that the warnings don't do enough to prevent abuse by jailers. Inadvertent invasion In Jayne's case, there was a mix-up between the jail employees and Campbell that made her number appear no different from any other outgoing call, court documents show. Campbell contends she asked jail officials in early March to put her new phone number on the jail's confidential attorney list. Jail officials have no record of her making the request and, when pressed, Campbell has been unclear on whom she called or spoke to, Van Buskirk said. Regardless, retired Superior Court Judge James McEachen agreed at a hearing in July that jail officials violated Jayne's Sixth Amendment rights to have confidential conversations with his attorney. But, he said, the intrusion was inadvertent, according to court transcripts of the hearing. "I have no evidence that the district attorney's office received this information and have used it or exploited it," McEachen said, according to the transcripts. Shasta County Assistant Public Defender Tim Pappas argued at the hearing that Jayne had no idea his call was being recorded, and wouldn't have left a message allegedly confessing to violating a restraining order had he known. Like Campbell, he said he's concerned that the jail's recording system is dangerous to the fundamental right to attorney-client privilege, regardless of whether there's a message warning that jailers may listen in. "When it comes to the Constitution, you can't take shortcuts," he said. Such automated call-recording systems have also been causing legal troubles elsewhere. In 2006, the U.S. attorney's office in San Francisco dropped gun-possession charges against a man after a prosecutor acknowledged listening to just 35 seconds of a recorded call the defendant placed to his attorney from a jail in Oakland. In Broward County, Fla., the sheriff's department recently settled a class-action lawsuit filed after at least two inmates found their protected calls were inadvertently uploaded during a two-week test of a new $18 million recording system in 2006. Pappas said Jayne was considering filing civil rights complaint in federal court. Other breaches? Pappas argued during the hearing that calls Jayne had made to Campbell may have been recorded for almost a month. He said he was concerned prosecutors might have been privy to them before the glitch was fixed. Officials at the jail and the district attorney's office at the hearing adamantly denied any such breaches. The hearing included sworn testimony from several jail employees, who said that they listened to the recording of Jayne's message to Campbell during an internal discipline investigation. Officials at the jail say Jayne, who's accused of stalking and threatening to kill his ex-wife, among other charges, violated a restraining order by calling her at least 60 times using jail phones. Because he violated his restraining order, Jayne was moved out of the jail's main population into a section segregated for troublesome inmates, court documents show. Jayne was described by jailers during the hearing as a habitual troublemaker and complainer. Jail staff members said the conversation with Campbell was revealed during their research into Jayne's other calls. And Van Buskirk said the call was never used to punish him. Jailers found plenty of other nonconfidential calls to her for that, he said. When Jayne learned during the investigation that his call to his attorney had been recorded, he notified Campbell and filed a complaint. After the issue came to light at a bail hearing, the jail added Campbell's number to the confidential list, Pappas said. But in doing so, the computer system automatically deleted all recordings made from Campbell's line, leaving her with no idea how many times her calls to clients might have been overheard. "There's no way to see who listened to it or had access to it," Pappas said. "It just got cut off." At the hearing, Campbell testified she received as many as 20 calls from the jail during the period when her number wasn't on the list. She testified the conversations included detailed conversations about defense strategy. Campbell said she's considering following Pappas' lead and requesting the cases in which she's defending Jayne be dropped. She said she's not willing to say whether she'll do same with any other clients. She said she doesn't buy the argument from jailers that the intrusion was unintentional. "They knew it was going to an attorney," she said. "They did put me on list; they just happened to listen to all the calls when I was on the list."

(08-10) 04:00 PDT Jones Valley, Shasta County -- The penalty for starting one of California's colossal wildfires can be severe - even if it was an accident. Just ask Matt Rupp. The father of six was recently paroled from the state prison in Vacaville. He served two years with killers and rapists for igniting a fire near Redding by riding a mower over a field of dry grass on a scorching day in 2004. "I didn't belong" in prison, Rupp, 48, said in his first interview since the fire. "To set a fire, you have to set a fire." Prosecutors said Rupp ignored warnings not to mow - from neighbors and public-service spots on TV - and told one passer-by, "Go to hell." A blade hit a rock, investigators said, and the spark became the Bear Fire. It raced over a hill and through 86 homes in Jones Valley, a remote community on the edge of Lake Shasta. No fire in 2004 burned more homes in the state. While Rupp's neighbors recovered and rebuilt, Rupp went away. Now he's back in Shasta County, banned from living on his old property and furious at the way he's been treated. Pointing across his temporary home - his sister's double-wide trailer on a 10-acre windswept ranch property in the small town of Anderson - he said, "Let me lock you up in the bathroom for two years, see what you'd do." The Vallejo native, who said he had been unable to work since a fall at a Napa construction site in 1996, said he had no way of paying the $2.25 million he owes to the victims of the fire. "I can't even buy milk for the kids," he said. As California struggles through another brutal season of flames, Rupp's case illustrates a unique aspect of the fight. Wildfires are that rare disaster that can be set in motion by everyday human acts like mowing, barbecuing and driving. Dubious acts, enormous cost When the human acts are questionable and the cost is great, as in the Bear Fire, investigators want to send a message. "Mr. Rupp caused a tremendous amount of hurt and pain to people by his actions," said Ben Hanna, the Shasta County prosecutor who convicted Rupp of a felony count of recklessly causing a fire that burned structures or property. "His attitude," Hanna added, "showed that he was the type of person who was not going to learn from his mistakes. A prison sentence was appropriate." Rupp's attorneys disagree, saying that although Rupp had a couple of past convictions - including for possessing stolen property - he deserved jail time only. His trial attorney, James Richardson, said the grief of fire victims carried too much weight with the judge. "He definitely got hammered," said Jean Marinovich, his attorney during appeals. But she acknowledged that sentences in such cases "have to be harsh enough for people to pay attention." Legal experts compare negligent fire-starters to reckless or drunken drivers who injure or kill someone - even if they don't mean to. Jim Fox, San Mateo County's top prosecutor, said authorities in such cases must prove that a defendant disregarded the risk of his actions, deviating from what a reasonable person would do. For example, he said, a motorist whose tailpipe drags and sends out sparks would be reckless if he noticed the problem and kept going. Fire officials said Rupp's sentence was one of the strictest in recent memory for a fire-starter who lacked an arsonist's intent. Some defendants have served much less time by cutting plea deals. After one of the worst fires in California history - the 2003 Cedar Fire, which killed 15 people and burned 2,200 homes east of San Diego - a deer hunter got six months in a halfway house. Sergio Martinez said he had started a signal fire after becoming lost and disoriented in the Cleveland National Forest. He told survivors in court, "I wish I was dead instead." Turned down plea deal Unlike Martinez, Rupp turned down a plea bargain - a deal that would have landed him in county jail for just a few months. Rupp took his chances at trial, where Hanna told jurors he mowed a dry field after 1 p.m. on Aug. 11, 2004, a day with temperatures above 105 degrees. The prosecutor said a neighbor drove by and warned Rupp to stop but he replied, "Go to hell." Rupp told The Chronicle that he was mowing because the county had ordered him to clean his property. He insisted he had stopped mowing at 10 a.m., hours before the fire started. He said he declined the plea deal because he didn't want to confess to a crime he didn't commit. Shasta County Superior Court Judge Richard McEachen scolded Rupp at his sentencing in April 2006 and gave him four years in prison - two for the felony charge and two for a special allegation of arson. As a nonviolent offender, Rupp had to serve half his term before being paroled. Rupp said he had wanted his trial moved out of Shasta County, where he said he was threatened - and even confronted - after the fire by people who lost homes. "How could they pull a jury out of these people?" he asked. "They were all mad as hell at me because I burned their homes down." Rupp now lives with his sister and her husband. His wife, Tina, and his five youngest children, who range in age from 7 to 15, live on the property where the fire started. His sixth child is an adult. Though he has served his time, Rupp is consumed by his quest to get his conviction overturned and keeps an apple box full of documents - legal motions and letters from his attorneys, who he believes failed him. He said he was dismayed to hear on the news that a target shooter who started a fire west of Yosemite National Park probably would not face charges. Rupp said his parole agent sent him to anger management classes, but that he's not angry. "It causes stress in my life," he said of the case. 'Ignorance is no excuse' In Jones Valley, there are mixed feelings about Rupp, but some fire victims still can't believe he chose to mow that day. Many wish he would apologize. A few hours after Rupp's interview, Doug and Sue Craite pointed out the property where they once lived in a two-story house with a hillside view. All that remains is a concrete foundation and blackened posts from their redwood deck. After they moved to a new house a few miles away, young people started using the lot as a spot to hang out, paint graffiti and drink beer. The couple can't bring themselves to sell the lot because they say they didn't choose to leave it. "Ignorance is no excuse," Doug Craite said of Rupp. But his wife said she was surprised when the fire-starter got prison time. "When you hear prison, you think of really horrific things, like violent crimes," Sue Craite said. Richard Saffen, a retired carpenter, gave a tour of the house he built on the same spot where his old home burned in the Bear Fire. He said he loves it - and that his insurance took care of him - but he misses photographs, high school yearbooks, motorcycles and guns that were torched. He said many of his neighbors weren't as lucky and that Rupp got what he deserved. "I don't know him personally. I just know he turned my life upside down," Saffen said. "Forest fires are a fact of life up here. You just don't go out and mow the weeds when it's 106 degrees." E-mail Demian Bulwa at dbulwa@sfchronicle.com .

July 4, 2008 Offender sentenced for not registering

James Richard Murphy Jr.



A Shasta County man was sentenced Thursday on a felony charge of failing to register as a sex offender and will serve a 25-years-to-life prison term under California's "three strikes" law. James Richard Murphy Jr., 49, pleaded guilty to the charge Wednesday and was sentenced Thursday in Shasta County Superior Court, said a spokesman from the Shasta County district attorney's office. Murphy was convicted in 1992 of molesting a 7-year-old girl. He also was convicted in 1986 and 1997 of residential burglary, the spokesman said. Murphy was arrested in March by Anderson police on suspicion of possessing methamphetamine. He had been living in Redding at the address where he was registered until May 2007, but he failed to notify authorities about his move to Anderson.



No charges planned for Redding defense attorney in dispute By Kimberly Ross

Thursday, July 3, 2008

A Redding defense attorney won't face a charge of domestic violence after his arrest on suspicion of the crime, both his lawyer and Shasta County Assistant District Attorney Dan Flynn said Wednesday. Michael Sharpe was arrested May 22 on suspicion of inflicting corporal injury on a spouse or cohabitant. But his arrest by Redding police inside Shasta County Superior Court led to a mistrial and a tarnished name for Sharpe, said his attorney, John Kucera. "He's got an excellent personal and professional reputation, and they just ruined it, or tried to ruin it," Kucera said. Flynn confirmed Wednesday that his office will not file a domestic violence charge against Sharpe."The evidence was insufficient ... to be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime occurred," Flynn said. Redding Police Chief Leonard Moty said Wednesday that the alleged victim changed her story after showing physical injuries and making serious assault allegations that she had been kicked, punched, pushed and thrown to the floor. "When we have domestic violence cases, we take those very seriously," Moty said. "And we want to make sure that if we err on any side, it's on the side of the victim." Moty agrees with the district attorney's office decision not to prosecute Sharpe, he said Wednesday. He defended his officers' arrest of Sharpe as appropriate. Kucera thinks otherwise. He criticized the Police Department for not investigating enough before arresting Sharpe, who received threatening calls from his alleged victim and injuries that included abrasions and a bite. "She came to his house, attacked him, and he defended himself," Kucera said. "I mean, he's got bite marks." Kucera said the Police Department should pay Sharpe's $5,000 bail bill, and he's consulting with Sharpe about whether to sue. Moty said Kucera is "being ridiculous." "The system allows us to make arrests when we feel it's appropriate ... and you can post bail, or wait (in jail), and that's the way the system is set up," he said.

Public defenders face misdemeanors over actions at Redding bar

By Jim Schultz

Thursday, June 5, 2008

The Shasta County District Attorney's Office has filed misdemeanor charges against three public criminal defense attorneys who were arrested in April on suspicion of starting a drunken ruckus with police officers at a Redding bar. Deputy public defenders Amy Margaret Babbits, 31, Michael Caleb Borges, 27, and Joseph Michael Ahart, 29, are due to be arraigned Monday, as is Ahart's brother, 24-year-old Peter Patrick Ahart of Williams. The complaints against the four were filed Tuesday by the district attorney's office. District Attorney Jerry Benito said that each misdemeanor count carries a maximum sentence of six months in jail. He stressed Wednesday that the three deputy public defenders are not associated with his prosecutor's office. But typically in such cases, he said, it would be highly unlikely for the co-defendants to receive lengthy jail sentences if convicted. Most likely, Benito said, probation, fines and minimal jail sentences would be the result. "The goal is to treat them like any other individuals arrested for the same type of conduct,� he said. But it�s also likely that an out-of-county judge would hear the case to avoid any conflict with Shasta County�s judges because the three attorneys regularly appear before the court, Benito said. Public Defender Neal Pereira said Wednesday that a county investigation is still pending, but that it will be done by an independent investigator and not in-house. That report, which would be confidential, would be reviewed by him and the county counsel�s office to determine what, if any, disciplinary actions might be warranted against the three deputy public defenders, he said. Although any discipline would also be confidential, it could range from a letter of reprimand to job termination, he added. It�s clear that he Pereira hopes it doesn�t come to dismissal because they are valuable and hard-working employees, he said. �They are very good,� he said. �It would be hard to replace them. We�ll see what happens.� Benito has said that the April 26 incident started when police responded to a report of a man, later identified as Peter Ahart, allegedly urinating in the parking lot of Club 151, a nightclub on Bechelli Lane. When police confronted Ahart, the three deputy public defenders came out of the bar and a disturbance ensued that resulted in their arrests, he said. They were all released from jail on their own recognizance. Babbits is being charged with two misdemeanor counts of resisting or obstructing an officer and one count of public intoxication, while Borges is being charged with three counts of resisting or obstructing an officer and one count of public intoxication, electronic Superior Court records show. In addition, Joseph Ahart is being charged with one misdemeanor count of public intoxication and a single count of unreasonable noise, while his younger brother is being charged with a single count of public intoxication and urinating in public, an infraction.

Re-entry dies; broken prison system lives on

Our view: Overcrowding and budget cuts will put more criminals on California�s streets. Voters rendered their nearly unequivocal verdict against the proposed state re-entry facility, and the Board of Supervisors unanimously sentenced it to death. They didn't just kill the plan for a rehabilitation-oriented prison-lite in Redding. They dug a deep grave, tossed the idea down in it, doused the corpse in gasoline and set it on fire, then filled the hole with concrete. However deeply buried this notion is, though, California's prison problems are bound to claw their way out of the ground and haunt the north state. As District Attorney Jerry Benito, who opposed the re-entry facility, told the supervisors and the crowd Tuesday, the state is considering several plans to ease prison overcrowding and cut spending on corrections. Plans vary and all are controversial, but the bottom line is fewer criminals behind bars. And if the state doesn't either release inmates from prisons that are stuffed to double their capacity or put fewer felons behind bars in the first place, a panel of federal judges is threatening to free tens of thousands of prisoners -- the most commonly reported number is 40,000. The alternative was a law passed last year to expand prisons and jails, as well as create the re-entry centers. But just as Shasta County nixed that idea, it's finding few takers around the state. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has done an incompetent job of explaining the plan, shaping its details and working with county officials, which soured even decision-makers who once saw promise in the idea, such as Sheriff Tom Bosenko. That rotten management seems to be standard practice in the Department of Corrections, and it's reaching a crisis point. We won't have a re-entry facility in Shasta County, but as Californians we don't have a ghost of a chance of escaping the consequences of a broken prison system.



January 26, 2008 500 inmates do not add up to 'prison town' Our view: Critics of a proposed state re-entry facility say it would make Redding a �prison town� akin to Susanville. The numbers tell a different story. At meetings this week to discuss a possible state prison re-entry facility in Shasta County, critics of the idea repeated the complaint that the correctional facility would wreck the Redding area's lifestyle and stain its reputation. Like Susanville, some say, we'd be forever marked as a "prison town." Can we talk facts for a minute? The lovely Lassen County city of Susanville has a population of about 18,000 -- of whom more than 11,000 are enjoying the hospitality of the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation at High Desert State Prison and the California Correctional Center. Well over half of the residents of Susanville are inmates, which makes "prison town" not a metaphor but a literal fact. While we're at it, throw in about 1,000 more inmates at the relatively small Federal Correctional Institution at Herlong, in southern Lassen County, and fully one third of the human beings in the county are behind bars. By contrast, state prison officials and Shasta County are discussing a facility with between 200 and 500 beds -- approximately the size of the current Shasta County jail. Even if the state built the largest re-entry center envisioned, those 500 inmates would amount to about one half of one percent of Redding's population. It's doubtful most residents or visitors would even notice the facility if it were built out on Clear Creek Road near the city power plants, the current proposed site. There are a lot of unanswered questions about the plan, and the state needs to address them. But the notion that this re-entry facility would somehow tar Redding's image or transform its residents' lifestyle is preposterous bombast.



Expanded jail a critical need for Shasta County

Leonard F. Moty

Monday, January 14, 2008 A concern facing communities throughout California is the severe overcrowding of prison facilities, as well as what to do with the growing number of people being released on parole. In May 2007, Assembly Bill 900, the Public Safety and Offender Rehabilitation Services Act, was signed by the governor with the primary objective of addressing this issue by funding new beds for rehabilitation purposes and creating "secure reentry facilities." The county has indicated it would be willing to listen and review the various options being proposed by the state; however, much research would be needed prior to considering locating a secure reentry facility within the city limits as part of this program. The specter of a reentry facility in the immediate Redding area has drawn considerable reaction from citizens and will surely intensify if there is a strong commitment to building such a facility. Certainly, there are a number of legitimate questions about a reentry facility, and I have wrestled with the merits of the issue and what effects it might have on the city now or in the future. Frankly, there are advantages to the local reentry facility concept. The state's "carrot" in giving jail funding preference to counties that agree to build such a facility is part of an attempt to reform a prison system plagued by high recidivism rates (70 percent) and legal mandates to reduce its population. In their final year of incarceration, prospective parolees would be placed in a reentry facility in their home community where they would be provided the necessary tools, such as training, rehabilitation and education, to become law-abiding citizens. The principle is to improve public safety by reducing recidivism. These are all laudable objectives that would help solve some of the problems we face. But they are outweighed by my concerns that the state will not fulfill in the future what it is proposing right now. The state's track record, unfortunately, is not the best when it comes to delivering promises. What is to prevent future lawmakers, under different financial circumstances, to change the rules and turn reentry facilities into something never envisioned, such as destinations for non-local inmates (and their families) or higher-risk offenders? What is very clear is that Shasta County must find the means for an expanded jail facility in order to eliminate the need for the early release of inmates. As many as 2,600 inmates were released in 2007 because of capacity demands, putting criminals or prospective criminals on city streets with little or no accountability. And the situation will only get worse given the overcrowding of state prisons. With judicial mandates to reduce prison overcrowding, local communities like Redding may well face the need to house more dangerous offenders. In fact, it is quite possible that the state prisons may release inmates as well as no longer accept prisoners for low-level offenses, and therefore, try to push that responsibility onto local jurisdictions. As a result, more people will be released from jail without facing consequences for their actions. For the safety of our citizens, an expanded jail is crucial. Whether Shasta County can obtain jail-bond funding without agreeing to a reentry facility is debatable. What isn't, however, is the critical need for a new jail, and it would be my hope that the entire community would be united in supporting such a project. Leonard F. Moty is the Redding chief of police.



Vague plans fuel wariness of state �re-entry facility� Our view: The state must flesh out details before the county or the public will bite.

California�s prison system is launching a laudable venture into inmate rehabilitation, planning to build thousands of beds� worth of �re-entry facilities� that aim to help ex-cons become law-abiding citizens upon their release. At least, that�s what corrections officials say they�re planning. When pressed for details, they punt. And the vagueness of the proposals � even as the state is wooing counties to sign up � feeds suspicions. No sensible consumer would buy a new truck without knowing the miles per gallon, the payload and the length of the warranty. How can the state expect county officials to buy a new prison-like facility without a concrete sense of what it would be? Yet the state is offering counties millions of dollars for new jails � with grants in part depending on whether counties will make room for a re-entry facility. And county requests are due by mid-March. Meanwhile, a state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokesman said the agency hopes to have conceptual designs to show counties next month or in February. That could leave as little as a couple of weeks to vet plans before deciding whether to sign up. That�s scant time for such a major decision, and the rush lends an appearance that the state is pushing Redding to make itself, as critics say, �a prison town.� That seems like a gross overstatement. The re-entry facilities are supposed to hold a maximum of 500 inmates � nothing close to the 11,000 inmates in Susanville�s prisons. Further, a re-entry facility in Shasta County would house only offenders who would eventually be paroled to the county anyway. That�s a relatively small population, so even a 500-inmate facility is unlikely. But what�s likely and what�s supposed to happen are a poor basis for a decision. The state�s new-found focus on rehabilitation holds out the promise of cutting both recidivism and the cost of California�s immense prison system. But vague promises won�t be enough for county decision-makers or the public.



With or without help from state, jail is essential Our view: It�s essential to the integrity of the justice system that the supervisors commit to helping the Sheriff�s Department move forward � even if limited money from the state means a new jail must be built in phases. In hindsight, betting that the state would pay the whole cost of a badly needed new Shasta County jail was as naive as laying down 20 bucks on a sidewalk game of three-card monte. Trying to fix a growing problem with early jail releases, the Sheriff's Department has put its hopes on a statewide cell-building blitz designed to ease severe overcrowding in California's prisons. The federal courts are threatening to free tens of thousands inmates if the state doesn't fix the problem, which gives the state some incentive to get moving. But nothing comes free. The state paid for most of the new library but demanded a matching share of local money. The state will likely pay for a new courthouse but insisted that the city or county "donate" the land. Similarly, the state has money to help counties build jails, but it will be rationed out stingily. The county will receive, at best, enough money for a few dozen new jail beds, while Sheriff Tom Bosenko had hoped to double the current capacity of 381. And the county will probably need to scrounge up money for a share of the construction cost. If the county must pitch in a few million dollars, it's worth the money. When courtordered jail sentences become a sham, and especially when the crooks know it, it erodes the integrity of the justice system. However, with little or no state funding, the county would be wise to build the new jail in phases. Simply doubling capacity would be cost-prohibitive, not just for construction but in hiring an expensive new corps of guards. Moving slowly has advantages, as long as plans make room for future expansion. But it's essential that the supervisors commit to helping the Sheriff's Department move forward. The jail is expected to free 2,800 inmates before their terms are up this year -- and the number of offenders catching a break will keep expanding until the jail does.

Woman commits suicide at Shasta County Jail

By Record Searchlight staff

Originally published 02:18 p.m., August 14, 2007

Updated 02:18 p.m., August 14, 2007

An unidentified woman was found unconscious and hanging from a bed sheet in her jail cell at the Shasta County Jail early this morning. A jail correctional officer discovered the woman during a routine cell check at about 1:11 a.m. today, Redding police Sgt. John Ostrowski said. Jail staff, including correctional officers, sheriff�s deputies and medical staff, immediately gave the woman CPR and called a Mercy Medical Center life support unit to the scene, Ostrowski said. Efforts to resuscitate the inmate failed and she died just before 1:30 a.m., he said. Ostrowski said the woman�s name is being withheld until her family is notified. A multi-agency investigation was conducted and investigators think the woman committed suicide, he said. The woman was alone in her jail cell and was found hanging from a bed sheet, which was used as a ligature. Investigators also found several suicide notes and letters in her cell, Ostrowski said. More information was not immediately available.

Sex offender policy targeted

Tehama officials don't want county to be dumping ground for parolees

By Debra Moore (Contact)

Wednesday, April 18, 2007 By the numbers Here's a look at how many registered sex offenders live in north state counties: Shasta County: 506 Redding: 318 Anderson: 66 Cottonwood: 35 Tehama County: 175 Red Bluff: 90 Corning: 39 Los Molinos: 10 Butte County: 464 Oroville: 176 Chico: 126 Glenn County: 55 Orland: 32 Sex offender facts � 63,000 sex offenders are required to register in California on the Megan's Law Web site. � 22,000 sex offenders are not included on the Megan's Law Web site but known to law enforcement. � 9,451 registered sex offenders are on adult parole. � 2,454 parolees are designated as high risk. � 90 percent of child victims know their offender, with almost half of the offenders being a family member. � Most sexual assaults are committed by someone of the same race as the victim.

Because the father worked away from home for stretches of time, the parents were concerned about their daughter's safety. The teen was no longer allowed to be home alone and the family had to substantially alter its routine. Warner was concerned because the teen's family and the sex offender lived on a dead-end road in rural southern Tehama County, a 15- to 20-minute response time for law enforcement. "This is the first time that I had to deal with this," Warner said. "I couldn't believe that the state would parole a sex offender next to a home where a 14-year-old girl lived." He wrote a letter to James Tilton, secretary of the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, that outlined his concerns. He asked that the placement be reconsidered. Within a month he had his reply -- an unsatisfactory one, Warner said. Sharon C. Jackson, the state's regional parole administrator, said the case had been reviewed and she was satisfied that adequate precautions were being taken to assure the safety of those nearby. "In considering this placement decision, as required by California state law, the Division of Adult Parole Operations considered many factors," she wrote. "Our staff placed the greatest weight on the protection of potential victims and the safety of the community." She said parole agents and local law enforcement were closely monitoring the parolee and that numerous special conditions had been placed on his parole. Jackson also responded to another of Warner's objections, that the parolee had not been released into his last county of residence, as required by state law. Citing penal code, Jackson said the offender was released to Tehama County because that is where his parents reside. "His potential for successful reintegration in society is enhanced through the support being offered by family members," she wrote. The situation in Warner's district is one that is at issue across the state and the nation. It was recently reported that five sex offenders are living under a bridge in Miami because there is nowhere else for them to go. A parole agent checks on them daily. Restrictions that keep offenders 2,500 feet from anywhere children might be have made it difficult for cities to house their registered sex offenders. Warner worries that rural areas may become dumping grounds. He, Sheriff Clay Parker and County Counsel William Murphy attended a statewide summit in March to discuss the issue. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger addressed 350 state and local leaders who gathered for the California Summit for Safe Communities: Investigating Collaborative Solutions for Housing High Risk Sex Offenders and Sexually Violent Predators. The day's discussions focused on notification and release protocols, residential facilities, and local and state collaboration. The state is required to give local law enforcement 60 days' notice before a high-risk sex offender is released into a community. A high-risk sex offender is a convicted sex offender who has been deemed by the state to pose a higher risk to commit a new sex offense in the community. Both Warner and Parker want to see the notification period increased to 180 days and communicated that request during the summit. Once the sheriff receives notification, he begins his own process of alerting neighbors and the community. "We have been aggressive in alerting our residents," Parker said. "We have implemented an e-mail alert system that is now being duplicated by other counties." Parker said that Megan's Law, enacted in 1996, allows the public to search a database for sex offenders. Individuals can go to the Megan's Law Web site and enter a city or Zip code and view a listing of all the registered sex offenders in that area. Tehama County residents can go to the sheriff's office Web site and request an e-mail alert when an offender moves into their area. "This prevents the public from having to log on and look on a regular basis," Parker said. "They will be automatically alerted." There are 175 registered sex offenders in Tehama County, with more than half living in Red Bluff. A review of the Megan's Law site reveals that many are grouped in local apartment buildings and hotels. Parker said he prefers it that way because it is easier to do compliance checks and to provide services such as for drug and alcohol abuse and mental health issues. While grouping sex offenders has met with some success locally, it was an issue at the summit. Representatives of the California Apartment Association said their members often are caught in the middle. If they admit sex offenders, they say, they run the risk of losing their regular residents, and if they deny access to sex offenders, they face potential lawsuits. Warner said the message he took from the conference is "We've got to find a place for them to live." In addressing the summit, Schwarzenegger said it would take a collaborative effort of state and local leaders to find a solution. The information collected during the summit will be condensed into a report and sent to all participants. Parker and Warner hope the summit is the beginning of a long-term solution. In the meantime, Warner is still working on behalf of his constituent. "We always talk about protecting the victim, but I want to make sure that we protect (potential) future victims," he said.

Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 7:49 a.m. (Suggest removal) The system doesn't care. How much longer can this go on? Sometimes people in the system try their best and work with what they have, but ultimately there's not a lot of precautions taken. Trying to determine where an offender can live, who is living next door then or might in the future, is probably not easy to deal with, since no one wants (or should have) a sex offender living next to them. The fact is, if they have to register, they are a potential threat and the system knows this. The facts are, and studies and the system's experience with these people, is that it's extremely rare for a sex offender to be rehabilitated. So, the simple question is, why are they released in the first place, ever? When the society come to tolerate it to not keep them locked up indefinitely? What possible good does it do to let them out? If it's about costs of keeping them locked up, it's probably more to watch them and deal with it all, but we should have less (or none) penalties for things like drug arrests if there's not enough room to keep sex offenders/violent criminals locked away for good. Also, I'd be willing to foot a higher tax bill to ensure they stay locked up, and who wouldn't? So, the next question is, why do they allow them to live in areas with any kids, or any sex offender in an area with any women or any potential victim? How is it possible we allow this? There's got to be a better solution. How are the people making these laws not being held accountable? Why are we tolerating this for so long? Posted by ATimeOrTwo on April 18, 2007 at 8:37 a.m. (Suggest removal) I went to the Website for Meagans Law and found out that at the end of my street, there are 3 or more sex offenders living in a newly built halfway house. There are kids ALL over my street, 3 living just next door to me. Its crazy that they allow stuff like this. And to live with another sex offender? That seems like an incentive to me. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 8:54 a.m. (Suggest removal) Check downtown Redding, it looks like a galaxy of stars. I am glad to say that, at least according to that map of registered one's, there's none within a mile of my neighborhood. Of course, that's assuming there's not one that just failed to register their true address, and those are just the one's that were caught, tried and released,m so there's always the danger regardless and people should protect their children, family (and themselves) accordingly fully aware of the unknown danger anyway. A lot of the offenses do happen away from their area so they aren't caught. But, obviously Megan's Law was formed because of the one's that do take advantage of a situation where they live close or work for a company that has their employee's go into potential victim's homes, etc. I just can't fathom how we all tolerate this. Not many people seem to agree with the current system's handling of these people, and for good reason, yet we're not really getting anywhere better in a hurry about the laws either. Posted by Teeny24 on April 18, 2007 at 9:36 a.m. (Suggest removal) Where are these people supposed to go? I can't stand sex offenders anymore than the next person but even they need a place to live. However, I think in the end, this country needs deal with these kinds of crimes differantly. Slapping them on the hand and letting them go obviously hasn't worked! Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 9:42 a.m. (Suggest removal) How about a pine box six feet under.I think that this is the perfect home for every child molester out there. Posted by opinionscount on April 18, 2007 at 9:47 a.m. (Suggest removal) If a person is a convicted child molester then they need to be placed away from children. It should be a parole violation if they live close to children and then they can go back to prison. I'd rather spend my tax dollars to keep my children safe from them than to see them free. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 9:55 a.m. (Suggest removal) Why would you want to waste tax dollars on on someone that cannot be fixed.Rehab doesn't work, castration doesn't work.These are people that are sick;Rope 25 cents a foot,pine box, what about 50 bucks and problem solved.No need to worry about that one coming after any children,and our tax dollars can be spent on something else.(Like maybe our kids educational needs) Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 9:56 a.m. (Suggest removal) Teeny24, everyone's aware they have to live somewhere, they do exist, and they were once people. But, that's the problem and suggestion, of what to do with them where it's not just a matter and debate about where they live. Either some type of community needs to be established to keep them separated from the citizens where they can't be harmed (this is what prison is for), or they need to be kept in the prison they were in. The fact is, if it's a threat, they shouldn't be let out. Prison is intended to not just punish people, but keep people safe from those people. I'm not assuming you disagree with me, or that you do, but I just see there's a problem that needs to be dealt with much better than it is now. What's the point of the system if it's just there to punish by locking them up for some predetermined time, when they'll likely repeat and definitely pose a danger in the time they are out. So, where are they supposed to go? No one has a good answer for that, but I think people should have a right to refuse them in their area. Obviously everyone would refuse them, so they can start their own colony/town somewhere for all I care (and be monitored/tracked). It literally doesn't make sense to have the citizens put in this situation, it's not of sound logic. They really just need to be kept locked up for life (and I'm not talking about some 18 or 19 year old that had sex with a 16 year old and it was consensual, but real, true dangerous offenders that rape and molest people of any age). If these people were facing, literally, life in prison, it also might deter some of these crimes (probably not, but it's possible). The only downside I see with the harsher penalties like that which I'm suggesting, is that some of the offenders might move from rape to rape and murder, for fear of being caught and seeing they have nothing to lose (unlike only a few months or years with today's system). I wish the world was a different place, but we can only work with that we have. At least the offenders in the system now, serious offenders, should never be let out. If it's about taxes and costs and overcrowded jails and prisons, then let the non violent offenders free first to free up some room and costs. Or just put the serious offenders to death. Maybe I should move to Texas, they have the right idea. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 9:58 a.m. (Suggest removal) wildwoman, I completely agree with the death penalty for such offenders. But my suggestion of a tax hike, if needed to keep them in prison, is something I'd agree to, if it kept them in prison. People are less likely to agree to the death penalty, it's less popular of an idea, so if given the choice between things staying the same or a hike in taxes, I'd pay more to ensure they remain locked up. If enough people would agree to impose the death penalty, then that's all good, too! Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 10:06 a.m. (Suggest removal) I just wish it could come to the death penalty for these type of offenders. I would even pull the lever to watch them hang for free.I can actually see other people volunteering to build the pine boxes and dig a holes.The only good use I see for them is becoming fertilizer. Posted by Mom2B on April 18, 2007 at 10:30 a.m. (Suggest removal) There is really no good place for a dangerous sex offender. They can always find another victim. They system can't even keep track of them. Remember that 6 year old little boy that was missing for a week and found dead? The sex offender was ordered to move from his current address because he was too close to a place where children congregated. He moved in with his parents and lured this boy away from his grandmother's house. Not only was the sex offender to blame, but the father and mother took part in it as well. We live in a sad world. If the authorities won't take precautions against repeat offenders, we have to. We have to know where they are and who they are. I moved from downtown Redding a few months ago and I never left my doors unlocked because of the number of sex offenders that lived within 3 blocks of me. I would never go for a walk or jog without my dogs. I am thankful that I moved. I now live a pebbles throw from an elementary school, so I feel a little better that there is no registered sex offenders living around me. We have to protect our children and ourselves. I carry pepper spray. Life isn't the same as it was when we were growing up. I would never let me child walk home alone from school or to/from anywhere. We all have to remember that no one is safe, so the best think to do is be prepared for the worse and hope for the best. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 10:53 a.m. (Suggest removal) Exactly, being an aware, safe and cautious parent (and person if you're a woman) is the key to avoiding these incidents, for the most part at least. Still, it would be nice and appropriate if the system handled the known offenders (more) properly. Posted by Mom2B on April 18, 2007 at 11:07 a.m. (Suggest removal) I say find an unihabited island and ship them all there if they must be released. Posted by BottomLine on April 18, 2007 at 11:25 a.m. (Suggest removal) This really ticks me off... So the offender is suppose to be released in the same county as they were incriminated... that makes most people all warm and fuzzy... NOT ME... Our family was tormented by one of these criminals and he gets to be released in Shasta County in three years... oh that makes me sleep better... I know I get to run into the ******** soon. How fun is that... It's not and it's very scary. My daughter is going to have to live in the same county as the jerk... I worry about who he may live near... I worry deeply. He beats his woman and preenes the young lady in the house. Coming soon to a neighborhood near you in three years... Posted by BottomLine on April 18, 2007 at 11:30 a.m. (Suggest removal) OH and they were going to slap him on the wrist and say "bad boy" until we got up in court and stated what he had done... that wasn't easy. I do appreciate the judge on the case, he knew the family this guy belonged to was prominent in Redding and decided to give the criminal the most he could give on a "first offence" (that we know of) six years. Posted by gamerjohn on April 18, 2007 at 12:09 p.m. (Suggest removal) Moving sex offenders to someplace else is how so many of them got dumped up here. The new law that the State voted in meant that all the perverts in the Bay Area would have to move to more rural places. That's our neck of the woods. Granted that the listing doesn't tell you really what happened in the cases. It could have been a 17 year old boy with a 15 year old girl friend and now they are grandparents, but he was convisted of statutory rape in 1970. It could be a gay guy with another gay guy, but they were arrested for being gay guys. For safety sake, you have to presume that it was a kidnap/rape by a stranger and act with caution. Posted by 2boiz4me on April 18, 2007 at 12:31 p.m. (Suggest removal) One important thing to remember: while Megan's Law site shows all sex offenders in a given area, not ALL of those registered offenders have committed crimes against children. That may be why there are some placed in an area where children are. There are other situations that require offenders to be registered aside from crimes against children. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 12:35 p.m. (Suggest removal) Also remember that on Megan's Law they tell you exactly what crimes they have committed, and if they are in violation. Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 12:39 p.m. (Suggest removal) Since this is a very volatile topic, the first thing we need to understand is that we can't keep going like this. While it's easy to say that we should just kill all the sex offenders, the short answer is that's not going to happen soon unless we have a vigilante in the midst. Barring that, I have a solid, constitutional answer to what to do with registered sex offenders: Ban them to a Sex Offender Colony. Nobody wants sex offenders to live in their neighborhoods, or even their cities. I�m a parent, and I would fight tooth and nail to prevent sex offenders from living anywhere that children may live. Unfortunately, these sex offenders have rights. If they are not in prison, they will probably get the ACLU to sue the city and we will have to spend thousands of dollars defending the restrictions. The ONLY thing, therefore, is to create an amendment to the US Constitution, creating sex offender colonies to restrict where these convicted sex offenders live in the first place. How to do this? The first thing that needs to be done is to create an outline of such an amendment. I looked at the process for how an amendment is created. Here is the process: Under Article V, there are two ways to propose amendments to the Constitution and two ways to ratify them. To propose an amendment 1. Two-thirds of both houses of Congress vote to propose an amendment, or

2. Two-thirds of the state legislatures ask Congress to call a national convention to propose amendments. To ratify an amendment 1. Three-fourths of the state legislatures approve it, or

2. Ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states approve it. I would submit that the state legislature route would probably be more effective, but the congressional method can be tried first. It can effectively be used as a litmus test for voting, i.e., if someone doesn�t want to vote for proposing the amendment in congress, their 2008 opponent can have a field day in saying that the incumbent protects sex offenders at the expense of children�s safety, etc. Such an amendment would solve many problems. First of all, the registry would not exist in its current form. Parents don�t have to worry where the monsters live, as they all would, by law, have to live in the colony. This also eliminates the need for GPS, as the sex offenders would be restricted to the colony in the first place. No worries about convicted child molesters stalking your children�s school or favorite park, or trolling on the Internet. <<continued in next post>> Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 12:41 p.m. (Suggest removal) <<continued from previous post>> Next, registrants would constitutionally have to be subjected to non-court ordered search of their premises within the zone. In addition, all their mail and phone calls would constitutionally be authorized to be monitored for illicit activities. Internet usage would also be strictly regulated, with all file storage for every computer actually done at the server-level. In addition, emails would be assigned by the administration, no Instant messaging or accessing MySpace or other children sites allowed, and all keystrokes and sites visited will be recorded 100%. All costs for such usage would be borne out by the offender, incidentally. All registrants would be required to work, with their paychecks being handled by the administrators. Deductions for medical, rent, all services, and everything else would be done automatically, and any credit the registrant have be used for discretionary income ONLY from the colony store. Also, EVERY registrant will be required to go through treatment appropriate to his crime, and be certified as cured; otherwise, he can be subject to a felony charge and returned to prison. Now, please keep in mind one thing: The sex offender colony is NOT�repeat�NOT a replacement for tough, appropriately long, non-paroleable sentencing guidelines in the first place! THAT IS PARAMOUNT. The colony would exist because society cannot handle the large amounts of offenders in their neighborhoods, with the inherent terror parents have with the knowledge that offenders are around their children. Therefore, the colony is SPECIFICALLY for offenders to spend their entire registration periods in a constitutionally-approved manner, eliminating the need for registries as they exist now. Keep in mind, many offenders also are able to leave the registry for certain crimes after a specified amount of time has passed. Therefore, once a registrant�s time period has expired, he can petition the administration to be relieved of the duty to register and live in the SORERA zone. A panel of professionals, law enforcement individuals, and the offender�s victim representatives, will go over the request. If they feel the offender is ready to join society, then he can leave the zone and live anywhere he wants, although he will have to permanently register with law enforcement wherever he goes for the rest of his life. Bear in mind, also, that any registrant who has to register for life will NEVER get the opportunity to leave the zone. Only the most benign of the registrants will ever be allowed to leave. Incidentally, I am working in conjunction with some of Nancy Grace�s fans and hopefully, she will introduce such an amendment this summer, and hopefully by 2010 we will have established sex offender colonies where EVERYONE who is required to register as a sex offener must live. No registries for me, get the monsters OUTTA here! Contact me at man4theages@hotmail.com if you want to be part of this just cause. Posted by Momofthree on April 18, 2007 at 12:57 p.m. (Suggest removal) I am in total agreement with wildwoman. Pine boxes for all of them. Think about it. They are adults, they prey on children because children are smaller, they can be easily tricked and influenced. They threaten them that if they tell someone, they will kill their families and so the poor little kids are the only ones who suffer. These creeps dont suffer. They shouldnt be allowed anywhere near a child. I like the idea of a sex offender colony where they will have to live. That way we can keep our eyes on them. (Or take them all out in one swoop!) There is absolutely nothing worse than a child molester. NOTHING!!! They are the lowest of the low and should have all of their rights taken away so they can be treated like the garbage dumpster scum that they are. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 1:21 p.m. (Suggest removal) I have told my children exactly that Momofthree, "that if anyone touches you wrong and they tell you that they will hurt or kill anyone of us, don't believe them.You tell me and I will take care of it,and remember no one can hurt Mommy." Do you really think that I would drag it through court.Thank god my children are well informed and protected,truthfully I wouldn't want to have to become a monster myself. Posted by Lee on April 18, 2007 at 1:28 p.m. (Suggest removal) The 8th Amendment states, �Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.� It seems to me this Colony would come under �unusual punishment� in that only sex offenders are targeted. What is next? Should we make another �colony� for meth addicts so that their meth labs no longer endanger us? Maybe we should take a lesson from England, who made a whole country their �penal colony.� We may love what Australia is like now, but back in the early 19th Century it was a very hard place to survive. Another thought: the more we place restrictions on liberties now, the easier it is to do it again to other �undesirables.� Who are the next �undesirables,� ones that follow �this� religion or �that� religion, ones that are �fat� or �skinny?� I do not have an answer to this problem, but restricting Constitution given liberties is NOT the answer. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 1:41 p.m. (Suggest removal) Child molesters,people who are making meth are CRIMINALS they do not deserve any rights.NONE.It's ok for some sick-o to inflict cruel and unusual torture to our children,and then they are protected by the 8th Amendment.That's the first thing that needs amending. Posted by r_swanson on April 18, 2007 at 1:54 p.m. (Suggest removal) Look. If people are so worried about sex offenders reoffending (because they almost always do), why are we reintegrating them into society? If we know they'll be a hazard to others in the community, why unleash them? Most of them can't be fixed and will just reoffend over and over. They don't need to be out on the streets. Period. Posted by Mom2B on April 18, 2007 at 3:03 p.m. (Suggest removal) What about the leper colonies? I think there are still a couple in existence. Was that cruel and unusual? It wouldn't be cruel and unusual. They would have their own society with stores, jobs, parks and everything. They just wouldn't be able to be a part of regular society and be able to attack others. It's a way to keep society safe. It's no more cruel and unusual than sending them to prison. Posted by Mom2B on April 18, 2007 at 3:10 p.m. (Suggest removal) r_

We are all in agreement with that, I'm sure. However, we are not the ones who determine who gets released. If it was up to me, the only criminals that would be released are the non-violent criminals...Burglars, car theives, corporate thieves, scam artists, etc. Violent criminals should remain locked up. Violent criminals, however, should not be released...Sex offenders, murderers, child pornography and kiddie sex organizers, etc. Our penal system needs a lot of work, that's for sure. Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 3:24 p.m. (Suggest removal) First, let's be clear: the 8th amendment does NOT preclude long, harsh sentences for most levels of child molestation. Virtually all sentencing regarding child molestation is now at a level that is horribly LOW. Legislatures are finally getting up to speed creating the appropriate sentencing guidelines for child molestation and sex offenses. But that does NOT mean that sex offenders whove ALREADY been sentenced, served their time, and are free as you and me are any less dangerous than those whom are not being sentenced. The bottom line is this: NO parent wants sex offenders living in their neighborhoods or near where children congregate. The problem we have now is that registered sex offenders, both on parole and clear of the correctional system, cannot be constantly shuttled based on new laws being created on a daily basis. Offenders have been fighting back to restrictions, indeed claiming some of the arguments that Lee had opined in his post. In addition, the first, fourth, and fifth amendments, as well as the ex post facto clause, have been bandied out as defenses by the attorneys of sex offenders. There is NO compromise to this solution. Either the offenders are either integrated into society, or they aren't. Since the vast majority of citizens do NOT believe most molesters can be reintegrated back into the community, the ONLY solution is to create a place where they are segregated from society. However, under the current system of an "arms race" mentality between communities, counties, and even states, there are literally HUNDREDS of ordinances and lawsuits. But simply saying that "we need to put them in pine boxes six feet underground" is not going to do a thing. Nor would other vigilante type statements that only come from emotions, and NOT true community-based policy, help the situation of segregating offenders from children. That is why I proposed a Constitutional Amendment, and I believe ONLY a constitutional amendment is the ONLY legal remedy we can engender for our communities. In short, it takes a constitutional-level amendment to preclude the residency restrictions, gps restrictions, and Internet restriction challenges being made at this time on a piecemeal basis. Once the amendment is in place, it CANNOT be challenged in court. Even the ACLU couldn't do a thing about it. Indeed, Missouri is actually changing THEIR constitution because it currently doesn't allow sex offenders convicted before a certain date to appear on the registry; the new constitutional amendment to the state would allow for that inclusion. So there IS precedence for constitutional challenge and regulation to sex offender issues. In short, it takes a constitutional-level amendment to preclude the residency restrictions, gps restrictions, and Internet restriction challenges being made at this time on a piecemeal basis. Once the amendment is in place, it CANNOT be challenged in court. Even the ACLU couldn't do a thing about it. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 4:57 p.m. (Suggest removal) I still stand my ground,Death sentence. I guess that's why the prison system keeps the child molesters out of there population(society),this is where they need to be integrated. But I guess that because we are so civilized, that we have to build them their own society ,so that they can live out the rest of their lives and ours safely. Of course this is after he/she has destroyed an child's life.Death sentence please how do we go about making that into law. Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 5:39 p.m. (Suggest removal) The only way we can make a death sentence part of the sentence for a child molester is if they have killed the child. But I'll be honest: those cases are few and far between. And if that's the case, I'd prefer to see death sentences handed out to MURDERERS first, no matter what age the victim. Unfortunately, only .02% of all murderers are executed. Until we see a much greater rate of murderers being executed can we thing about injecting the death penalty into non-murdering charges. But even if you kill, say, 20 of all sex offenders, that still leaves over half a million out in society who have already served their time. You just can't go back and kill THEM after the fact. THAT'S why the sex offender colony needs to be seriously considered. AS emotionlly satisfying as it sounds to execute all pedophiles, realistically it won't do a damn bit of good to PREVENT other molestations, and THAT'S the real goal of any policy. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 6:01 p.m. (Suggest removal) Gee Lee, you're right, if we're going to send sex offenders to prison, what's next? Huh? Sendign fat and skinny people to prison, or people we find "undesriable"? Or MAYBE, just maybe, this is being suggested because it's appropriate and it's a way to allow them to be protected, while keeping the innocent citizen of our nation protected. You wouldn't happen to be one of the local sex offenders, would you? If not, explain yourself. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 6:09 p.m. (Suggest removal) Steven this self contained colony, how do you suggest we prevent escapes? Remember, this idea will never fly with the society we live in, or we'd have GPS ships in all their brains already. Anyway, I'm serious, you can see my thoughts from earlier today. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 6:09 p.m. (Suggest removal) Pardon the typos. Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 7:26 p.m. (Suggest removal) Tim, I appreciate the question. The bottom line is that any offender who is not in the zone automatically becomes a federal fugitive, with a sentence of at LEAST ten years, non-paroleable, if it's his first felony, and at LEAST twenty years if it's his second. His third, he goes down for life. (A registrant may only have a misdemeanor, but still be required to live in the zone). Since all registrants will be in zones, then law enforcement won't have the necessity of monitoring their residency in communities. Therefore, there will be the ability to put out a LOT more resources to track down the colony escapee. Now to respond to your question regarding how the colony would "never fly". My contention is that it will not only fly, it will SOAR. Keep in mind that virtually every restriction against sex offenders usually pass at the rate of 80-90% wherever they are proposed. Even California, a so-called liberal blue state, passed at over 77% of the vote restrictions so harsh that it restricts offenders from living in 84% of the populated area of the state, and it mandates EVERY felony sex offender to wear GPS for life. Of course, they never did figure out how in tarnation they were going to PAY for all this monitoring. And that's the beauty of the sex offender colony. It passes on the costs from municipalities to the offenders themselves (colonies would by law have to be self-sustaining), it would suppress ACLU court challenges (and independent challenges) as the constitutional amendment would, indeed be CONSTITUTIONAL (duh!), and if would wipe out virtually every offense that could be committed by a registered sex offender. Now, even laws such as this would have to still undergo other constitutionality challenges. My contention is that these laws are consistent with other laws around the country, such as residency restrictions, buffer zones, and now, Internet restrictions. The colony itself is the LOGICAL and CONSTITUTIONALLY LEGAL outcome of such laws. Incidentally, while I'm NOT concerned about this part, sex offenders THEMSELVES would consider the colonies to be good things. They could live in communities free of potential harassment and also know that they would not automatically be suspect if a child went missing in their area. They could also work without having to worry if they were going to be voted out via residency restriction. In short, it's a win-win situation. Recap: Registered Sex Offenders segregated from our children (no worry about having to consult an internet registry every week or so). Registered Sex Offenders pay for their own existence in the zone (no ongoing cost to taxpayers). No need for GPS for sex offenders in the zone (saves law enforcement resources) No need to worry about internet predation (Internet strictly restricted and costly; no file storage) IN short, this is probably the only idea that would pass muster with the American public short of 100% execution. Posted by wildwoman on April 18, 2007 at 8:47 p.m. (Suggest removal) Steve is this just your solution to the problem or is this actually being debated somewhere else besides on this forum.Personally I really don't see this flying myself either. I don't want to see any of our green earth being wasted on pedophiles, either. No room on this planet for them,but that is through my eyes. Posted by Steven on April 18, 2007 at 9:33 p.m. (Suggest removal) wildwoman, I share your sentiments, emotionally. But I'm someone who is more interested in RESULTS, not in fantasies or emotional outputs. And the harsh reality is that we aren't going to be able to kill pedophiles or send them to the moon. We ARE going to start sending them to prison longer, in some cases for decades, when in the past they got out after a year or two, for starters. However, there are hundreds of thousands of registered sex offenders whom are OUT of prison now. While we can certainly make sentencing laws that would pretty much put them in jail for decades for their next sex crime, the residency restrictions, Internet restrictions, and other civil actions are going to be more and more in vogue. However, such actions only increase the litigation that will be conducted by the ACLU types and even private lawyers hired by convicted child rapists. Therefore, the sex offender colonies not only will fly, it will be constitutionally bulletproof, and we will have final determination on the sex offender issue. Posted by redding_resident on April 18, 2007 at 9:37 p.m. (Suggest removal) That "slippery slope" argument doesn't connect sexual freaks to fat/skinny people. I wonder what the real motive is for someone to defend this group of people. Posted by Tim on April 18, 2007 at 10:14 p.m. (Suggest removal) redding_resident, exactly. That comment from Lee was just off the wall, I can't tell if that person was being a jerk, joking, or if they were just trying to point out that it wouldn't be possible due to those reasons and didn't work it properly, but it seemed pretty sinister to me. Steve, if the world were thinkers like us posting here, we'd not be in the predicament we are now to be the point where we're discussing a colony. I said this in my first post earlier today, I'd be for whatever it takes to keep these people locked up or removed from the innocent society, but as much as we hope, it might not be much more feasible than aiming for that island idea. I'd hope people would be for it, because as I also said earlier today, I don't think the death penalty would fly, but I honestly don't think people would see this as being much different and would be paranoid of "how far would it go" (see Lee's comment for a perfect example). Regardless, anything is worth trying and fighting for, so if this were ever up for any debate, input, etc., I'd be there standing next to you. I've considered getting into law just to do my part to help fix these problems and still might. Posted by wildwoman on April 19, 2007 at 7:20 a.m. (Suggest removal) Well lets put it this way,you figure that when I was growing up we really didn't know (as children)that these type of people were out there.I would say over what the past 20 yrs this has become a reality where everyone is aware. How much longer do you think parents are going to allow this to go on,before it does become a vigilante type scenario. If our law makers don't start protecting our kids parents are going to take into there own hands to make sure that these type of individuals cannot hurt our children. Right now the laws don't protect our kids.Life in prison and integrated into their society in which they wouldn't last long, even our prisoners won't tolerate them,that is why they are not with the population in prison, to protect them.Child molesters do not have a place anywhere,not even on their own island,colony,NO WHERE! It would just be easier to put them to death,then we wouldn't have to put up that individual ever again. It wouldn't stop pedophilia it will never stop,but at least there would be consequences. Posted by Steven on April 19, 2007 at 9:07 a.m. (Suggest removal) Wildwoman, again: I AGREE with your emotional argument that sex offenders should all be put to death immediately. I WISH that the laws were such that this occurred. But the reality is...it's not going to happen. When only .02% of all first-degree MURDERERS are executed, and 99.98% of all first-degree murderers are NOT executed, how in tarnation can we even THINK of applying the death penalty to NON-murder cases? Again, this is a RATIONAL question that cannot be answered truthfully. I am probably in the minority, but I believe that murder is much worse than child molestation. Of COURSE, if I saw a molester attacking child, I'd probably kill him on the spot if I had the ability to do so. But I'd do the same to anyone attacking my adult brother, my parent, or my friend. That's a natural, "heat of the moment" response that would hold up in court. My whole argument for sex offender colonies and creating an amendment is because it is MUCH better than what we have now. As you said, vigilantism is probably going to be the result of current policy, and unless we get the offenders away from the parents and the children in the FIRST place, and do it in a CONSTITUTIONAL manner, we will actually CREATE a much bigger problem, and then we will lose control of the offenders. Frankly, anything less that my proposal is more dangerous to the children, and that will ALWAYS be my bottom line. Preventing attacks is MUCH more preferable to execution of offenders, but most people, emotionally, feel it's the other way around. They do NOT go hand in hand, unfortunately.

Shasta County jail inmate sues over dangerous' care

By Jim Schultz (Contact)

Saturday, January 13, 2007 A 36-year-old inmate at the Shasta County jail has filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court claiming that he received "negligent" and "dangerous" health care at the West Street facility. In a suit filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento on Dec. 18, Everett Joseph Jewett of Happy Valley claims that he hurt his back while in jail, but does not specify how the injury occurred. Jewett's complaint says he was lying on his back in pain on the top bunk in his cell when Dr. Dennis Hawley, who was called to the cell with other jail personnel, tried to remove him from it. "When I told him I could not move, he grabbed me in a headlock' and proceeded to try jerking me off the bunk," Jewett wrote in his lawsuit. "I was then put on the floor (of a medical holding cell) for two days unable to move, (and) my meals were slid into the room next to my head. After two days, I was transported to the (hospital) emergency room." Named as defendants in Jewett's lawsuit are Tennessee-based Prison Health Services Inc., which provides the health care at the jail, on-site program supervisor Sharon Denney, Hawley and the jail. Assistant Shasta County Counsel Mike Ralston said Thursday that he was unaware that the lawsuit had been filed and that county officials have not been served with a copy of it. "I am not in a position to comment on it because I haven't seen it," he said. Ralston said it's likely that the lawsuit, once received, would be handled by Prison Health Services attorneys. Still, he was skeptical of the allegations after portions of the suit were read to him. "I would be real surprised if he was lying on the floor (for two days) having food shoved at him," he said, adding that Jewett may have exaggerated the doctor's actions. According to a Nov. 1 jail incident report included with the suit, Hawley grabbed Jewett by the arm as the inmate was lying in his bunk in an effort to try to pull him closer to the edge, but to no avail. "Dr. Hawley pushed Jewett's knees down to get his legs flat on the bunk and forced Jewett to sit up in his bunk," the report says. "Jewett immediately started to complain (that) his back hurt." "Inmate Jewett eventually stood up on his table and was helped down by officers" who also assisted him into a wheelchair, the report says, adding that he was then escorted via elevator to a medical holding cell. According to the report, Jewett became angry with Hawley during an elevator ride, repeatedly calling him an obscenity. "In the elevator, inmate Hawley stated his legs were numb" and that Jewett became agitated after the doctor said that being numb was not a medical condition, the incident report says. Hawley, who no longer works at the jail, could not be reached Thursday or Friday for comment. Jewett's complaint seeks an independent investigation into health care at the jail and "a monetary sum to be determined at a later time." Capt. Don Van Buskirk, who oversees the jail's administration, said Thursday that he had not seen Jewett's lawsuit and could not speak to its issues. But, he said, the jail has a well qualified medical staff that's responsible to provide health care for the inmates. Jewett remains in jail on a variety of drug charges, including possession of a controlled substance and transportation or selling of controlled substances, according to Shasta County Superior Court records. Records also note that Jewett was sentenced in June 2003 to more than four years in prison after being convicted of assaulting a peace officer, flight from an officer, obstruction and making threats.

Murder suspect commits suicide in jail

By Jim Schultz (Contact)

Originally published 10:13 a.m., December 28, 2006

Updated 10:13 a.m., December 28, 2006 A Jones Valley man accused of murder apparently committed suicide Wednesday night in his Shasta County jail cell by strangling himself with a bed sheet.



James Loren Hesson, 37, was found dead at about 7:10 p.m. by a guard conducting routine cell checks, Redding police and Shasta County sheriff's deputies said. Although correctional officers, deputies and the jail nursing staff administered first-aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation on Hesson, he couldn't be resuscitated. Sgt. Scott Mayberry of the Redding Police Department said this morning that Hesson apparently wrapped a sheet with a knot in it and tightly twisted it like a tourniquet around his neck, strangling himself. Although he did not leave behind a suicide note, he did leave a note asking jailers to notify his mother, said sheriffs Lt. Mike Ashmun. An autopsy is scheduled for Friday. Redding defense attorney Michael Khoronov said this morning that he was notified of his client's death Wednesday night, but could not comment further. Shasta County Deputy District Attorney Stew Jankowitz, the prosecutor in the case, also declined to comment, noting that the death is still being investigated. Ashmun said that Hesson, a Bella Vista native and bricklayer who had been in jail since late April, had not shown any signs that he might try to harm himself. Jailers last had checked on him only 30 minutes earlier, he said. There were no warning signs that popped up, said Ashmun, adding that Hesson had never caused problems at the jail. He's been pretty much a model inmate, he said. But Mayberry and Ashmun said that some fellow inmates indicated Hesson may have despondent over personal issues and his upcoming murder trial. Hesson was immediately arrested after the April 30 shooting death of 46-year-old Donald Lee Zahner of Redding during an alleged dispute over a weed trimmer. Investigators said Hesson shot Zahner once in the abdomen with a 12-gauge shotgun at the Bear Mountain RV Park after Zahner argued with 19-year-old Aaron Daniel Kuska outside the resort's store. Zahner died at the scene. Hesson had been scheduled to be tried for murder on Jan. 23, but the case recently was postponed to collect further evidence and he was scheduled to return to Shasta County Superior Court on Wednesday to receive a new trial date. Hesson's apparent suicide is the second this year at the jail and the fifth since 2000. The last inmate who killed himself was 51-year-old Robert Alfred Ybarra of Redding, who hanged himself with a bed sheet in his cell in June. In that case the sheet had been attached to a vent in the cell. Ybarra was in jail on suspicion of domestic violence and making terrorist threats. Before that, in August 2003, an inmate in jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon also hanged himself with bedding in his cell. But perhaps the most high-profile suicide at the jail was in November 2002 when double-murder suspect Benjamin Matthew Williams killed himself by slashing his neck, arms and legs with a the metal strip from a jail-issued razor wrapped around two parts of a pen. He bled to death. Reporter Jim Schultz can be reached at 225-8223 or at jschultz@redding.com .

Several sex offenders arrested in FBI-led sweep

By Lauren Brooks, Record Searchlight

October 13, 2006 Twenty-three people were arrested in a massive, FBI-sponsored sweep of more than 200 sex offenders in Shasta and Tehama counties, an FBI spokeswoman in Sacramento said Thursday. The sweep included Siskiyou County, but no arrests were made there. Wednesday's arrests led to two federal investigations of offenders who allegedly had child pornography on their computers, spokeswoman Karen Ernst said. The multiagency operation was part of a nationwide initiative by the U.S. Department of Justice called Project Safe Childhood. The Tehama County Sheriff's Department reported that 16 sex offenders -- men and women -- were arrested during the compliance checks. The alleged violations included failing to register as a sex offender or violating parole, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. Seven people from Shasta County were arrested on suspicion of being out of compliance with registration requirements, Shasta County sheriff's Sgt. Jeff Foster said. One of the arrests initiated a federal investigation into possession of child pornography. Foster said it was a sex-related offense similar to the one for which the person previously had been arrested, but declined to be more specific. "It rises to the level of a federal investigation," Foster said. Several people received citations for warrants or on suspicion of possessing drug paraphernalia, he said. The Sheriff's Department performed a large-scale compliance check six months ago and plans to do one every six months, Foster said. "They need to know that we're going to check on them," he said. Wednesday's check was an eight-hour operation in which officers searched offenders' homes for drugs and checked computers for child pornography. Most of the people arrested were sex offenders, but some were parolees visiting friends who were sex offenders, he said. Although 34 compliance checks were made for sex offenders in Siskiyou County, no arrests were made. They were all in compliance, Siskiyou County sheriff's spokeswoman Susan Graven- kamp said. One woman was cited for being in possession of a controlled substance, she said. Agencies participating in the operation included the Shasta, Siskiyou and Tehama sheriff's departments; the Redding, Anderson, Corning, Red Bluff, Weed and Yreka police departments; the Shasta and Tehama county district attorney's offices, the Shasta and Tehama county probation and parole offices, the California Department of Justice, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation; the FBI; the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement; and the U.S. Marshal's Service.

Woman assaulted at jail

Sexual attack reported in a holding cell

INSIDE LOOKING OUT: Correctional

Sgt. Ben Estill stands outside an observation cell

Thursday at the Shasta County jail. A 37-year-old

Redding woman reported being sexually assaulted

by a male inmate in a similar cell Wednesday.

September 15, 2006 A woman was sexually assaulted by a male inmate Wednesday afternoon in the Shasta County jail after she "inadvertently" was placed in a cell with two men, said Shasta County sheriff's Capt. Dave Compomizzo. The woman, who had been arrested on suspicion of being drunk in public, was placed in the observation cell by a female correctional officer around 2 p.m. and left alone with the men for 15 minutes, officials said. Correctional officers discovered the woman during a routine check of the cell, Compomizzo said. She immediately told officers that she had been assaulted, he said. The woman was described as a 37-year-old transient from Redding. Her arrest was the second time that day that she had been picked up on suspicion of being under the influence of alcohol, Compomizzo said. Compomizzo said he would not release the name of the
