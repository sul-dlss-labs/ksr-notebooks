MULLAN, Idaho â€” Officials have released the name of a Montana man who was shot and killed during a struggle over a gun with an Idaho sheriff's deputy.

Alexander L. Mandarino, 26, of Whitefish, Mont., died shortly after being shot along Interstate 90, about 2 miles west of the Idaho-Montana state line, the Kootenai County sheriff's office said in a news release Thursday afternoon.

A Shoshone County deputy responded shortly before noon Wednesday for a welfare check on the driver, whose car was parked in a turnout area near Lookout Pass. An Idaho State Police trooper arrived to assist.

The deputy discovered the man had a gun, and as the two struggled over the weapon, the trooper shot the driver. Neither the deputy nor the trooper was hurt.

Both law enforcement officers were placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.

Mandarino was taken to Shoshone Medical Center in Kellogg, where he was later pronounced dead.

Kootenai County officials said an autopsy was performed Thursday, but the results weren't released. Toxicology tests could take up to two months, officials said.

The Kootenai County sheriff's office is asking anyone who may have witnessed the altercation to call the sheriff's office at 208-446-1300.
