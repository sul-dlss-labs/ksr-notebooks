POOLER, GA (WTOC) - New evidence has surfaced in the shooting death of a Pooler man that occurred early Monday afternoon.

Evidence indicates that Jeffery Adam Beckworth died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. An autopsy conducted by the GBI Crime Lab supports the initial report made at the scene by Chatham County Sheriff's deputies.

Beckworth was being sought by the Chatham County Sheriff's Fugitive Squad because he failed to appear in court for an aggravated battery charge, violation of parole and felony probation violations. Those charges are from events that occurred on Sept. 26, 2010 in Garden City.

When deputies arrived at Beckworth's home in Pooler, he fled and then turned and aimed a handgun at the deputy pursuing him.

The deputy fired one shot that missed Beckworth. Beckworth then took his own life. This was consistent with interviews and physical evidence collected by Pooler Police at the scene.

That evidence has been released to the Crime Lab for further examination.

Beckworth was on felony probation at the time of the event for a prior conviction in Bulloch County. Because of the probation, he was prohibited from owning or possessing firearms.

The investigation continues by both Pooler Police and Chatham County Sheriff's Office.
