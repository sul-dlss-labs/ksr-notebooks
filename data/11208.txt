FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — A suspected gunman died early Tuesday during an officer-involved shooting in Fayetteville.

In a news release, police said a fight led to “an exchange of gunfire” during a party at 26-year-old Roman Lee Drake’s home in the 1500 block of Blan Street around 2:15 a.m.

Drake, the suspected gunman, returned to the scene in a vehicle shortly after officers arrived, police said.

After seeing the officers, police said Drake tried driving away.

While the suspect was trying to drive away, police said he struck one officer’s patrol car and attempted to run another officer over.

“While ordering the suspect to stop, the officers attempted to take cover and responded with gunfire,” police said.

As officers were shooting at Drake’s vehicle, police said it crashed into a house.

Drake was found dead inside with a handgun in his lap, police said.

The officers involved in the shooting were identified as patrol officers Johnathon Fisher, 34, and Sheila Thomas, 40. Fisher has been with the department since April 2008 and Thomas has been with the department since January 2006.

The SBI is investigating the incident and both officers have been placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation.

Police said several young children were inside the home at the time of the shooting, but none were injured.
