MAYES COUNTY, Okla. — A man was shot and killed by a Sportsman Acres officer Wednesday afternoon.

Officers were called to the 100 block of Quail Dr. about a man who had barricaded himself inside a bedroom. He was reportedly making suicidal statements.

Police say 51-year-old Sammy Monroe Echols, Jr. came out of the house with a rifle in his hand.

An officer reportedly told Echols to put the gun down, and he did so. But moments later, he allegedly picked the firearm up again and pointed it at the officer.

That’s when the officer shot him.

Sammy Echols, Jr. was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident. Once a written report is completed, an agent will deliver it to the district attorney who will determine if the shooting was justified.
