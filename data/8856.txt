(WAFF) - The Madison County Deputy Coroner tells us a 37-year-old Huntsville man has been identified as the man who was killed in the accident at the intersection of Pulaski Pike and Mastin Lake Road on Sunday night.

There were two accidents that happened on Sunday, with the first happening late Sunday afternoon and the second occurring around 9:30 p.m., which left 37-year-old Hamilton Palmer dead.

We have learned from Huntsville PD that the latest incident began with a 911 call for domestic violence just before 9:30 p.m. Sunday night.

When an officer arrived at the scene a short time later, Palmer attempted to flee in a sedan.

Police say Palmer hit the officer's patrol car before speeding away with his lights off eastbound on Mastin Lake Road.

At the intersection of Pulaski Pike he struck two additional vehicles, an SUV and a truck, one headed north on Pulaski Pike and the other idling on Mastin Lake Road in the westbound lane.

Palmer was killed in the collision. Three other people were taken to the hospital with injuries that are not believed to be life-threatening.
