GLOUCESTER CITY â€” A city man was shot dead by authorities after he allegedly raised a knife at them, Camden County Prosecutor Warren W. Faulk said. Carl Hurlock, 28, of the 500 block of Dukewood Avenue, was shot multiple times in front of his home.

Police responded to the residence about 6:15 p.m. Friday, for a report of a man with a knife. There they found Hurlock outside threatening to stab himself. Officers engaged in negotiations with Hurlock for approximately an hour, during which time Hurlock entered and exited his residence repeatedly.

About 7 p.m. Hurlock is alleged to have approached officers with the knife raised in a threatening manner. According to officers, Hurlock refused to drop the weapon despite repeated orders that he do so. An officer from Haddon Township and a Gloucester City officer fired their weapons.

Hurlock died from his injuries.

The incident remained under investigation, spokesman for Faulk said. Both officers involved in the shooting are placed on administrative leave, standard procedure whenever an officer discharges his service weapon with the result of injury or death.
