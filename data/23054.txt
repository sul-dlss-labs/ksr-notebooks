A deputy United States Marshall was shot to death after Memphis police say she shot one of their officers.

Investigators say U.S. Deputy Marshal Mary Fisher was behaving irrationally before she turned a gun on two Memphis police officers in the driveway of her home here in Cordova.

Investigators know that Fisher dialed 911 from her home and hung up last night.

When they arrived, a fellow deputy Marshall was at her home and told Sheriff's deputies that she had driven off in her white BMW in a delusional state.

Early this morning, Memphis Police officers spotted the BMW driving wrecklessly.

They say Fisher refused to stop when they put on their blue lights and sirens.

She led the officers to her house. The officers told her to get out of the car. She opened her door, leaned back into the car and the officers say she pulled out a gun and started shooting at them.

At that point, a neighbor phoned the Sheriff's Department and deputies arrived to the Fisher shot and killed and a Memphis police officer injured.

Detectives are trying to figure out what sparked Fisher's behavior.

"Nobody saw this coming. No, there's no prior history that I'm aware of that would have brought this on," said David Jolley a U.S. Marshall spokesperson.

Officer Patrick Taylor is in non-critical condition at the MED.

Both officers are on routine relief of duty while the Sheriff's Department investigates.

This is a very complicated case involving multiple agencies: the U.S. Marshals, Memphis Police and Sheriff's Departments.
