Investigation: Protecting the Shield

Separately, the Attorney General's Office announced an investigation into the death of a motorist following a chase by Gloucester Township police officers.

The motorist, whose name was not released, allegedly fled a hit-and-run accident in Gloucester Township shortly after 10 p.m.

Gloucester Township officers said they had ended a pursuit before the suspect was fatally injured in a four-vehicle collision on Sicklerville Road in Winslow.

The state agency noted a directive requires an investigation of any death that occurs during an encounter with a law enforcement officer acting in the officer’s official capacity or while a person is in custody.
