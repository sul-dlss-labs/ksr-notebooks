LAGUNA PUEBLO, N.M. (KRQE) – New Mexico State Police have identified the suspect who was shot and killed on Laguna Pueblo during an officer-involved shooting on Monday.

Police say 26-year-old Travis Vierra stole a woman’s Ford F-350 from her driveway in Belen around 5 a.m. Monday. A Belen police officer later spotted the stolen vehicle and a pursuit ensued but was discontinued.

About two hours later, Laguna Police Department received a call in reference to a suspicious vehicle located at windmill 9, off of I-40 exit 126 on the Laguna Indian Reservation. Two Laguna Police officers responded to the scene and located the stolen pickup and Vierra, who was armed with a handgun, according to state police.

Police say Vierra fled from officers and fired his handgun at them as they pursued on foot. New Mexico State Police were then called for assistance and after more shots were fired, they fired back, killing Vierra.

State police say Vierra had an extensive prior criminal history and at the time of the incident, was an absconder from the Department of Corrections Probation and Parole and he had two outstanding warrants for his arrest.

The names of the officers involved have not been released.

The incident is still under investigation by New Mexico State Police.
