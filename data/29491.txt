Chesterfield police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that followed a nearly 11-hour standoff early Thursday morning.

Police arrived at a residence in the 17100 block of Lansmill Drive at about 4:15 p.m. Wednesday to serve warrants on a male suspect, Jeffrey D. Kite, 36, for violating a protective order. Kite, who lives at the residence, refused to come out of the home and an adult female also was in the residence.

Police subsequently obtained a search warrant to enter the home and locate the suspect, as well as additional arrest warrants for stalking and violation of a protective order.

After several hours of negotiations with officers, the woman came out of the residence at about 9 p.m. At that point, police say, Kite stopped communicating with them.

For the next several hours, officers made numerous attempts to reestablish contact with the suspect but were unsuccessful.

Shortly before 3 a.m. Thursday, after nearly 11 hours on scene, officers entered the residence to execute the search and arrest warrants. During the search, officers discovered a storage area where Kite was hiding.

Police say Kite produced a weapon and fired shots at the officers, who returned fire and struck the suspect. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Chesterfield County Police Department at 804-748-1251 or Crime Solvers at 804-748-0660 or through the P3 app.
