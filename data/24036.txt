Arkansas State Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that left the subject of a manhunt dead Friday afternoon.

Searcy County sheriff's deputies and officers from the state Department of Correction were pursuing Daniel Allen Yielding, 23, of Paragould, state police said in a statement. The shooting took place around 12:30 p.m. about 2 miles north of Marshall off Arkansas 27, according to the release.

Law enforcement began searching for Yielding on Thursday based on an outstanding warrant for a parole violation and reports that the 23-year-old was seen fleeing a home, state police said.

Deputies and state correction officers spotted Yielding with a knife in a wooded area armed Friday afternoon, the release states. According to authorities, Yielding was ordered to drop the knife but refused to comply and moved toward a correction officer, who fired his gun as the man advanced.

The 23-year-old's body has been sent to the state Crime Lab for an autopsy.

The Arkansas State Police investigation will be submitted to the Searcy County prosecuting attorney, who will determine whether the use of force was consistent with Arkansas law.

Arkansas Department of Correction spokesman Solomon Graves said the officer who fired has been placed on administrative leave pending the results of the investigation, per department policy.
