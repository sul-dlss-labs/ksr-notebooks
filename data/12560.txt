(WMC-TV) - The suspect shot by a Memphis police officer in a Wal-Mart parking lot died.



Memphis police say 42-year-old George Golden died Friday at the hospital.

His cause of death hasn't been determined.

Memphis police officer Leon Dickson is still off the job with pay after police say he fired the weapon that injured George Golden on March 27.

Police say an off-duty MPD officer, Kimberly Houston, caught Golden shoplifting at the Wal-Mart on Austin Peay.

Houston then followed him out of the store.

That is when police say Golden became angry and struggled with the officers Erica Washington and Leon Dickson.

After trying to detain him, police say George Golden reached inside his waistband as if he was concealing a weapon.

Police say Golden then made a sudden movement toward officers. That is when Officer Leon Dickson fired one round, hitting Golden.

Golden was taken to The MED in critical condition where he died.

All officers involved in the shooting are assigned to the Old Allen Station.

Police later determined George Golden was not carrying a weapon.

Action News 5 reached out to George Golden's daughter and sister Tuesday.

Neither of them returned our calls.
