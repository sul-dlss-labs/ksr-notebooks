JASPER COUNTY, Ga. — A suspect is dead after exchanging gunfire with Jasper County deputies, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said.

The GBI was called to the scene on Grandview Road Monday afternoon.

Authorities told Channel 2's Tom Jones that a woman called the sheriff's office just before noon after a man pointed a gun at her and pulled the trigger. The gun didn't go off.

Deputies arrived at the suspect’s home a few minutes later and made contact with him. Authorities said the suspect told them he would not be taken alive and that deputies would have to kill him.

The man then came outside with his weapon and began firing, deputies said. Deputies fired back, killing him. No deputies were injured.
