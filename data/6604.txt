A Bossier Parish Sheriff's Deputy has been placed on leave after he hit and killed a pedestrian Friday evening.

It happened in the 700 block of Highway 80 in Bossier Parish.

My heart goes out to angelique's family. I can only imagine the grief they must feel at a time like this. We are doing everything in our power to help this family in the wake of this tragedy."
