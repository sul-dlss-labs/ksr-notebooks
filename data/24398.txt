Clark County deputies say a domestic violence assault suspect died Sunday after resisting arrest.

Deputies were dispatched about 8 p.m. to the 8700 block of Sorenson Road, between Woodland and Amboy, for the report of an assault, according to a press release from the Clark County Sheriff’s Office.

After an initial investigation, deputies decided to arrest the unidentified suspect.

“As they were attempting to take the suspect into custody, the suspect resisted arrest,” the sheriff’s office said. “The suspect was eventually taken into custody and medics were called to the scene due to the suspect having difficulty breathing.”

Deputies acted to care for the man until the medics arrived, but the suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

The deputies involved in the incident were identified as Scott Kirgiss, a 10-year veteran at the sheriff’s office, and Forrest Cook, who has 2½ years of experience. They were placed on administrative leave, which is typical following the death of a suspect.
