HOLLAND TOWNSHIP, MI -- The Ottawa County prosecutor has determined a police officer-involved shooting of a Holland Township man last month was legally justified.

Deputy Joshua Barton was found to have acted in self-defense when he shot and killed 43-year-old David Leroy Thelen Jr., according to a report issued Friday by Ottawa County Prosecutor Ron Frantz.

As a result, no criminal charges will be filed against Barton.

The incident took place shortly after 8 p.m. Nov. 23, when Barton and an AMR ambulance crew responded to a medical emergency call at Thelen's Beeline Road apartment.

An investigation by Michigan State Police determined that Thelen called 911 to report he "may have temporarily lost consciousness after bumping his head."

Thelen didn't immediately answer the door when police arrived, but was seen moving around the kitchen, police said. When he opened the door, he was holding a 13-inch kitchen knife "in a threatening manner."

The deputies drew their handguns and ordered Thelen to drop the knife. After ignoring "repeated warnings" and continuing to advance toward the officers "aggressively," Thelen was shot three times in the chest area by Barton, authorities said.

Witnesses from the apartment complex and AMR ambulance paramedics confirmed to police that Thelen ignored repeated orders to drop the knife while advancing toward the deputies.

Barton fired the shots from about 10 feet away, according to the report.

Investigation also found that Thelen "suffered from chronic medical and personal issues, had recently been hospitalized, and had a history of making frequent calls to 911."
