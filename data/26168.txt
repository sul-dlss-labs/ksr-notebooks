SPOKANE, Wash. — One person is dead after shots were fired inside a home in Ferry County on Friday morning while Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife officers were attempting to serve a warrant.

Law enforcement officials previously said shots were fired at an officer, but WDFW has since clarified that the shooting did not involve law enforcement.

Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife Spokesperson Staci Lehman said in a statement that WDFW officers were serving a warrant for wildlife trafficking and illegal hunting violations at a home in Ferry County, north of Republic, at 10 a.m.

Officers had information there were weapons inside the residence. When officers arrived they tried to call the people outside using a PA system.

Officials said one woman came outside while the male inside barricaded himself in the home. Then, officers heard what they believed to be a gunshot inside the home.

WDFW officers confirmed a man was found dead in the home around 5 p.m. The WSP/WDFW chaplain and Ferry county coroner are on scene. Investigators did not say how he died.

Officials are now searching the home for animal remains and conducting a search warrant on the property. According to Washington state law, it’s unlawful to buy, sell, or trade or barter wildlife parts. It is a felony.

Ferry County requested the help of Spokane County's SWAT. A helicopter and armored vehicle were also sent to the scene, Spokane County Sheriff Ozzie Knezovich said.
