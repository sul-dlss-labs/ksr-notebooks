The shooting victim from Monday’s homicide in Kevin and a suspect who died after reportedly opening fire on officers have been identified.

The Toole County Sheriff’s Office has identified 43-year-old Jeromy Wade Bryant of Kevin as the victim in the Kevin shooting, according to a release, as well as homicide and kidnapping suspect Richard Allen Moench, 50, of Shelby.

The Toole County Sheriff’s Office responded to a report of a shooting in Kevin, around 20 miles north of Shelby, on Monday morning.

Responding deputies found Bryant dead at a home and also learned that a suspect had taken an unnamed woman at gunpoint from Kevin to his home in Shelby and had barricaded himself and the hostage inside.

Deputies sealed off the area and Toole County Sheriff Donna Whitt requested the assistance of the Great Falls Police Department’s High Risk Unit as well as a negotiator from the Conrad Police Department.

Officials managed to negotiate the release of the female hostage and continued to speak with Moench, the release states. Moench reportedly later shot at officers from inside his home and they returned fire. He was later pronounced dead, but the release did not indicate if he died from officers' gunfire.

Whitt has requested that the Montana Department of Justice’s Division of Criminal Investigation continue the inquiry into the incident, and more information will be released as it becomes available, the release states.
