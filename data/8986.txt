HUNTSVILLE, AL -- A man who shot his stepson in Meridianville then took a woman hostage and shot her as she jumped out of the truck on Green Mountain has been shot and killed by police, according to Madison County Sheriff's Investigator Chad Brooks.

Brooks said at about 7 a.m. the sheriff's department received a call from a man in his 20s who said his stepfather had shot him in the back at a home on Fox Run Trail and then taken his mother hostage.

The woman who was taken hostage called 911 and kept her cell phone open while the truck headed south, calling out street names so that police could locate the truck, Brooks said. That allowed an officer with Owens Cross Roads Police to locate the truck and begin a low-speed pursuit onto South Shawdee Road on Green Mountain, Brooks said.

When the truck turned off South Shawdee onto River View Drive, the woman jumped out of the truck, and the man driving shot her in the shoulder, Brooks said. A Madison County Sheriff's Investigator that was in pursuit saw the woman jump out and stopped to attend to her as other officers continued to pursue the shooter.

Brooks said the man drove about a mile down River View, then jumped out of the truck and "made threatening motions toward officers with his weapon," and was shot and killed by an officer.

Brooks said the stepson was in critical condition at Huntsville Hospital and the woman was talking and conscious when HEMSI ambulance took her to the hospital. Brooks said the bullet went through the woman's shoulder and she also had injuries from jumping out of the moving truck.

The names of the people involved in the incident weren't immediately released.
