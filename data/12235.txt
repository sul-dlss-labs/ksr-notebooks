The Sheriff's Office says deputies who received an alert about the suspects possibly heading to Pennsylvania spotted their vehicle headed north after 9 p.m. Sunday and began to follow it. Deputies chased the vehicle north on I-95 for about 15 miles before the vehicle crashed in the median.

"We had two deputies sitting out looking for the vehicle," said William Terrell, public information officer for the Camden County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies said the driver, a 15-year-old girl whose name was not released, escaped with only minor injuries and was taken into custody. The passenger and murder suspect, Christian Murphy (pictured, above), died at the scene.

Titusville police say a body believed to be that of 41-year-old Michelle Chappell (pictured, left) was found Sunday afternoon in a home on Avilez Boulevard. Police say she was beheaded and her remains placed in containers.

The gold Nissan chased and wrecked in Georgia was reported missing from Chappell's Titusville home by homicide investigators.

"We don't know what the relationship between the two is," said Lt. Cleyton Brey of the Titusville Police Department.

The teen driver could be charged with vehicular manslaughter in the chase and crash, along with a possible murder charge in Brevard County. She's being held in juvenile jail.
