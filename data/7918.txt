Victoria Fox, a 53-year-old white woman, was shot by police officers and died Friday, March 6, 2009, after she barricaded herself in her home in the 8400 block of La Tuna Canyon Road in Sun Valley, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

The standoff began about 7:30 p.m. Thursday, when police received a telephone call from inside the residence saying that a woman was threatening to shoot and kill herself, according to Sgt. Gil Serafin of the LAPD's Foothill Division.

Two men inside the home tried to talk the woman into giving up, but failed and were evacuated once officers arrived, Serafin said.

Fox, who police officials said appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, fired two shots inside the home, hitting the ceiling, he said. As a precaution, neighbors were evacuated. Police closed off a stretch of La Tuna Canyon Road from Elben Avenue to the Foothill Freeway during the incident.

After more than 16 hours, Fox stepped outside the home about 12:30 p.m., raised a handgun and was shot by an officer, according to Los Angeles Police Department Officer Rosario Herrera.

She was taken to a nearby hospital where she died hours later, police said.
