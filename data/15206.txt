South Tucson Police Department identified the man who was shot and killed after firing at a police officer multiple times with a high-powered rifle.

At around 1:27 a.m. on Oct. 10, South Tucson police responded to an area near South 10th Avenue and West 38th Street to investigate a report of shots being fired, according to a news release from the department.

At the scene, officers encountered Frank R. Kerr, 40, walking on a sidewalk west of West 39th Street.

As an officer approached, the man faced him and fired his rifle several times, hitting the patrol car, the news release said. The officer fired back and struck Kerr, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

Pima County Sheriff’s Homicide Unit is investigating the shooting, which the police said is “standard protocol for an officer involved shooting.”
