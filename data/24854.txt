A suspected DUI driver died after crashing into a tree and retaining wall on Jamacha Road near E. Main Street in an attempt to evade police early Saturday morning, CHP said.

CHP officers attempted to pull over the driver just after 2 a.m. after noticing he was speeding and weaving on Interstate 8 eastbound near Severin Drive.

The driver sped away and exited on 2nd Street at an extremely high rate of speed - at times driving more than 100 mph, CHP said.

The driver lost control of the car before hitting the tree. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Resident Salam Al Abbo Ksaj, who was passing by the scene, was shocked by the crash.

â€œTo see something like that happening here in El Cajon, everyone wants to live in peace. You don't want to see a body in the middle of the street. There is family here, there is kids," he said.

The driver has not been identified.
