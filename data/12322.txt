LIMESTONE COUNTY, Alabama - A man who rammed a patrol car and attempted to run over officers during a police chase in January has not been charged because he was paralyzed from the neck down by officers' bullets, said Sheriff Mike Blakely.

Dexter Lee Fair, 21, of 158 McKee Road in Harvest remains on a ventilator and is being treated at a medical facility in Tennessee, the sheriff said. He was in Huntsville Hospital for about a month before being transferred, Blakely said.

"He's still getting medical attention so at this time no charges have been filed," the sheriff said.

Blakely said Fair was shot by Limestone County deputies on Jan. 31 after Fair attempted to run over officers with his car. Fair had been cornered after the high-speed chase, which began in Limestone County and ended on Jeff Road in Madison County.

If Fair's condition changes, pending charges could be filed in Limestone County, including burglary and attempting to elude police.

Evidence of a burglary was discovered in Fair's car after the chase, the sheriff said.

Blakely said the chase began after a resident on Mooresville Road called to say she saw someone peering into the window of a nearby home.

Because of recent burglaries in the area, deputies were making additional patrols and quickly spotted Fair in the neighborhood. When he saw police, he "jumped in car and took off," the sheriff said.

Items found in Fair's car belonged to residents of a Limestone County home that had been recently burglarized, Blakely said. The victims' home was a few miles from where Fair was seen looking in a window, he said.
