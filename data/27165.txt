Honolulu police fatally shot a man who was suspected of stealing a moped and repeatedly refused to comply with the officer’s order to put his knife down early today in Campbell Industrial Park.

He was the second man killed by Honolulu police officers in less than 24 hours.

Emergency Medical Services personnel responded to Barbers Point Deep Draft Harbor at about 12:45 a.m.

A 27-year-old man sustained two gunshot wounds to his upper chest and another gunshot wound to his upper abdomen area, according to EMS.

He was taken in “extremely critical condition” to The Queen’s Medical Center-West Oahu where he later died, according to the Medical Examiner’s office.

The Honolulu Police Department released the officer’s bod-cam video today. In the video the officer repeatedly tells the suspect to “put the knife down,” but the man ignores him.

The officer uses his Taser but it did not appear to have any effect on the suspect.

The officer continues to tell the man to put the knife down. When the man tried to start the moped, the officer approaches him.

Police Chief Susan Ballard said the man then lunged with the knife at the officer, who then shot the suspect.

On Monday morning outside a car dealership in Kalihi, officers fatally shot a 34-year-old man who they said shot at the officers during a chase.
