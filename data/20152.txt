Former aldermanic candidate Michael Lutz died early Sunday morning of an apparent suicide, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office.

Lutz, 44, a former Milwaukee police officer, suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound "while in the presence of Menomonee Falls tactical officers after a brief tactical situation," the medical examiner's office said in a release issued Sunday.

Lutz was pronounced dead in the 12300 block of W. Mill Road in Milwaukee at 4:05 a.m., the release said. An autopsy is scheduled for Monday.

Menomonee Falls police are investigating the incident.

Lutz finished fourth in Tuesday's primary in the 11th Aldermanic District to fill the Common Council seat left vacant by the death of Joe Dudzik. He received 426 votes out of 4,155 ballots cast.

He retired from the Milwaukee Police Department after 17 years, initially receiving taxpayer-funded duty disability pay for post-traumatic stress disorder. His pay was later converted to a regular retirement.

In 2005, Lutz was shot in the arm after he and his partner chased a suspected drug dealer into a house on the city's near south side. He never returned to active duty.

Lutz later became a criminal defense attorney and was the anonymous source for a series of stories last year critical of Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm.

Lutz suggested that Chisholm, a Democrat, had a political agenda in overseeing a John Doe investigation of aides and associates of Republican Gov. Scott Walker during his time as Milwaukee County executive and in initiating a separate probe of Walker's campaign.

A John Doe investigation is a secret proceeding into a potentially criminal matter.
