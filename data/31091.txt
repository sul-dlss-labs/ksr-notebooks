A 35-year-old man was fatally shot by law enforcement officers early Friday morning after their efforts to serve warrants at a Salcha residence resulted in an exchange of gunfire, Alaska State Troopers wrote in an online alert.

When a team of Alaska State Troopers and local law enforcement officers arrived at the home around 7 a.m., Scott W. Hottinger left the home while armed and started to shout, troopers said.

When Hottinger moved toward the officers, they identified themselves as law enforcement, according to troopers. Hottinger fired a gun and law enforcement then returned fire, killing Hottinger, troopers said.

No officers or others were injured, troopers said.

Hottinger had an outstanding no-bail felony probation violation arrest warrant stemming from a kidnapping charge, as well as an outstanding felony arrest warrant for a domestic violence assault and an outstanding misdemeanor arrest warrant from a previous assault, troopers said.

The law enforcement officer or officers who fired on Hottinger will be placed on administrative leave for 72 hours and identified after 72 hours, troopers said. Austin McDaniel, a spokesman for the Alaska State Troopers said Friday he did not have any information regarding how many members discharged their firearms but that it would be released in 72 hours.

The officers who served the warrants were part of the Northern and Southcentral Special Emergency Reaction Teams, which include state troopers, Fairbanks Police Department officers, North Slope Borough police officers and Alaska Wildlife Troopers.

An investigation into the incident will be conducted by the Alaska Bureau of Investigation. Upon completion, the investigation will be reviewed by the Office of Special Prosecutions, troopers said.
