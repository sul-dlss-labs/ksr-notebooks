A motorcyclist was killed when he collided with a car while fleeing from a Texas state trooper during a chase Sunday morning near Horizon City, officials said.

The Texas Department of Public Safety said that Raymond Harley Saenz, 29, of Clint, was killed when he hit a car at the intersection of Horizon Boulevard and Gateway West.

The chase began at about 5:30 a.m. when a state trooper saw Saenz on a 2016 Kawasaki ZX1 allegedly speeding southbound on Horizon Boulevard heading toward the Gateway running along Interstate 10, DPS said.

The trooper attempted to pull over the motorcycle, but it "accelerated to a higher speed," DPS said in a statement. The speed limit is 45 mph in that area.

DPS said that the motorcycle then ran a red light at the Gateway intersection. While running the stop light, the motorcycle collided with a Chevrolet Cruze.

Saenz, who was wearing a helmet, died at the scene, officials said..

The Chevrolet's driver, Esmeralda Reyes, 18, of El Paso, was taken to Del Sol Medical Center with injuries that were not believed to be life threatening, DPS said.
