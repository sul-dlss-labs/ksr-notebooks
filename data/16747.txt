A man driving a motorcycle led Topeka police on a pursuit late Friday that led to him colliding with a pole, killing him.

The motorcyclist was identified as Joseph A. Thomas, 42, Lt. Joe Perry said in a news release.

Police attempted to stop Thomas at 10:26 p.m. in the 2400 block of S.E. Adams for a turn violation. He accelerated away, initiating a pursuit. At 10:27 p.m., officers terminated the chase as Thomas passed Interstate 70 northbound, driving more than 80 mph.

Less than a minute later, they discovered the motorcycle had collided with a light pole at Overton and Branner, Perry said.

Police called first responders, and Thomas was transported to a local hospital with life-threatening injuries. He was declared dead by emergency room doctors at 10:59 p.m.

S.E. Branner Trafficway was blocked off from its Interstate 70 exit ramp north to its intersection with S.E. Washington Street on Friday night as police reconstructed the accident and investigated.

A motorcycle could be seen lying in a grassy area just west of S.E. Overton and Branner as American Medical Response ambulance workers used a stretcher to move the patient to their ambulance, which then left the scene.

Police appeared to be using their flashlights to search the area around the motorcycle.
