Live by the sword, die by the cops.



A Glenview, Illinois man a was fatally shot by police Sunday evening after he charged at them with a sword, according to the Chicago Tribune.



Arturas Kolgavas was apparently involved in domestic dispute at the 12 Oaks apartment building in unincorporated Glenview, when cops arrived.



The man barricaded himself into the second floor apartment at around 4 p.m. and threatened to hurt himself and police. The building was evacuated and a terrorist team was called in to negotiate.



After about an hour, Kogavas exited the apartment brandishing a large sword and approached police in a threatening manner.



One police officer then shot him in the chest.



He was taken to Lutheran General Hospital where he died.



The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Unit plans to investigate.
