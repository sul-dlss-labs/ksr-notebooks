A man who was shot and killed by Oceanside officers last year reported a “suicidal friend” to summon police before the fatal shooting, according to an autopsy report released Monday.

Officers were sent to a shopping center on Marron Road near College Boulevard after someone called 911 about a suicidal person on Sept. 22, 2017, about 12:30 a.m.

When police arrived, they found Alexander Sergio Ochoa behind a Kohl’s department store. Investigators later determined Ochoa had made the call.

The 26-year-old man was armed with a knife and refused repeated orders to drop it, police had said. Officers then shot him several times with bean-bag rounds and sent two police dogs after him, which knocked him to the ground.

Ochoa let go of the knife, but then reached into his pants and pulled out what looked like a gun, police said.

Three officers opened fire, killing him. The officers were identified as Johann Ravesi, then a 14-year veteran, Billy Walker, who had been with the department for two years, and Dustin Schmidt, who had four years experience.

Police later determined Ochoa’s weapon was a pellet gun.

According to the man’s autopsy, he had previously threatened suicide.

His cause of death was listed as a gunshot wound to the chest, and the manner of death was homicide.
