The police said the gunman’s motive was not known yet.

The gunman who killed nine people, including his sister, early Sunday morning in Dayton, Ohio, wore a mask, body armor and hearing protection, and he possessed a high-capacity magazine capable of holding 100 rounds, the police said.

The gunman, identified as Connor Betts, 24, used what the police described as an “assault-style rifle” when he opened fire in a busy entertainment district in Dayton. A shotgun was also found in Mr. Betts’s car. Both guns were purchased legally, the police said.

The authorities said they still had not established a motive for the shooting. They said Mr. Betts arrived in the entertainment district Saturday evening with his sister, Megan K. Betts, 22, and another “companion.” Mr. Betts then split from the rest of the group for a period of time before opening fire, the authorities said.

Ms. Betts was not the first person killed in the assault, and it remained unclear whether Mr. Betts had sought to kill her, the police said. The companion was one of 27 people wounded in the attack, and the police said they had spoken to him.
