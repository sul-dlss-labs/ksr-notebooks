Alfred Pouliot, a 27-year-old Latino, died Wednesday, May 26, six days after he was shot by Covina police in the 400 block of Potrero Grande in Monterey Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Pouliot was wanted for a series of violent crimes throughout the area, according to a news release from the Sheriff's Department.

Covina police officers, part of a multi-agency task force pursuing Pouliot, located him at a hotel about 3 p.m. on May 20. They set up a surveillance operation and observed him leave and enter a white pickup truck, according sheriff's officials investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Pouliot saw the officers in their vehicle and, according to the Sheriff's Department, intentionally rammed his truck into the officers' vehicle.

Pouliot then stepped out of the truck and allegedly pointed a handgun at the two officers, authorities said.

At that point, at least one officer shot Pouliot several times, sheriff's officials said. He was taken to a hospital, where he died six days later from complications from his injuries. One officer had minor cuts and bruising from the crash, authorities said.

Sheriff's officials did not identify the officers involved in the shooting.
