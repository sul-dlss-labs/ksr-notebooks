Suspect shot and killed by police in Southwest Philadelphia

SOUTHWEST PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia Police shot and killed a suspect just after 2:45 a.m. Friday in Southwest Philadelphia.

The officer-involved shooting happened at a rooming house on the 1200 block of South 51st Street.

Action News is told police initially went to the home at 1:30 a.m. to serve a warrant to the 51-year-old man who ended up dead.

The man left but returned again at 2:45 a.m. and was in violation of the order.

When officers went back to the scene, investigators say the suspect lunged at them with a 10-inch knife.

One of the officers used a Taser on the suspect.

"He recovers very quickly, lunges at both officers again with knife," said Philadelphia Police Captain Sekou Kinebrew. "The other officer then discharges his weapon."

The suspect was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead at 3:30 a.m.

No officers involved in the incident were hurt.

The officer whose weapon was discharged, a 3-year veteran of the Philadelphia Police Dept., has been placed on administrative leave as the investigation unfolds, which is standard procedure.
