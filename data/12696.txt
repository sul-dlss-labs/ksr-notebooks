Felipe Corrales, a 45-year-old Latino was fatally shot on Thursday April 25, in the 900 block of Truman Street in San Fernando, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Corrales was wielding a tree branch the size of a baseball bat when he was shot and killed by police, authorities said.

Officers from the San Fernando Police Department responded to the scene early Thursday morning "regarding a possible battery assault call for service," according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which is assisting in the investigation.

When the officers arrived about 5:40 a.m., authorities said Corrales attacked at least one of them with the branch.

"The suspect tried to hit the officer with the tree branch but instead hit the officer's patrol vehicle. The officer deployed less lethal force device, however, the Taser had no effect due to the layers of clothing the suspect was wearing," according to a news release from the Sheriff's Department.

The man again approached the police officer, who shot him. Authorities said Corrales was taken to a hospital, where he later died.
