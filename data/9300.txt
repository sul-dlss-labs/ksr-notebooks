A Torrance man riding a stolen motorcycle died early Friday when he crashed into a concrete bridge wall during a police pursuit in Glendale, police said.

The 51-year-old man failed to pull over after passing by a patrol officer at a high rate of speed, said Sgt. Tom Lorenz of the Glendale Police Department.

He also put his feet in the air and rode without holding onto the handlebars during the chase, Lorenz said. The rider lost control on a curve, jumped the curb and was launched headfirst into the wall near Canada Boulevard and Towne Street, Lorenz said.

Although he was wearing a helmet, the man was pronounced dead at the scene at about 12:45 a.m., according to coroner’s officials. His identity has not been released pending notification of next of kin.

The man was arrested two months ago on suspicion of arson by Los Angeles police, Lorenz said. The motorcycle was reported stolen out of El Segundo.
