A man was killed in a crash after allegedly fleeing a traffic stop Sunday in west suburban Aurora.

Authorities tired to pull a vehicle over after seeing it run a red light about 2 a.m. at Broadway and Ashland Avenue, according to the Kane County sheriff’s office.

The driver, 47-year-old Mark Brown, accelerated and didn’t stop when a deputy activated a squad car’s emergency lights and siren, the sheriff’s office said. The deputy ended the pursuit a short time later, and Brown’s vehicle eventually struck another vehicle more than a mile away at the intersection of Broadway and Benton Street.

Brown, was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash, the sheriff’s office said. No other injuries were reported.

The Kane County Major Crimes Unit and Aurora police are investigating.
