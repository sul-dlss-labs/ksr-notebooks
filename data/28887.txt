MANHATTAN — The Manhattan man wounded in Wednesday's officer-involved shooting has died.

Jarred Kemp, 41, was shot during the incident in the 4600 block of Freeman Road in Manhattan, according to Police Lieutenant David Ernst with the Lawrence Police Department. They are the agency investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Just before 8p.m. Wednesday p.m., the Riley County Emergency Communications Center received a 911 call from a man stating a family member discharged a firearm and was threatening to shoot the caller, according to police spokesperson Rachel Pate.

Officers arrived on scene and determined the man was experiencing a mental health crisis. A Mental Health Co-Responder was requested to respond and arrived around 9 p.m. At that time, the public was notified to avoid the area to protect any residents nearby. Riley County EMS, the RCPD Emergency Response Unit, and representatives from Fort Riley responded to the scene.

Crisis negotiators spoke with the man in attempts to peacefully resolve the incident. A little after midnight it was determined the situation had deescalated and emergency responders began leaving the scene. At approximately 12:32 a.m., an officer still on scene reported the suspect fired his weapon again, prompting another elevated police response.

At 1:00 a.m., officers left the immediate scene for a second time in an effort to deescalate the situation but remained in the area to ensure the safety of others, including representatives from Fort Riley that stayed on scene to continue assisting us in our efforts to safely resolve the incident for all involved. At 1:38 a.m. the suspect threatened the family member with his weapon again. Two RCPD officers then shot at the suspect.

Kenp was transported to Via Christi in Manhattan then life-flighted to Topeka for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Per department policy, the two officers directly involved have been placed on administrative leave. To ensure transparency and an impartial investigation, the Lawrence Kansas Police Department will be the lead agency investigating the case.

RCPD Director Dennis Butler expressed his condolences to all those involved. "I am saddened by the news of Mr. Kemp's death. This is a tragedy for so many reasons and I wish to offer my personal condolences to his family, friends, and fellow soldiers at Ft. Riley and elsewhere. Moreover, I offer these condolences on behalf of the men and women of the Riley County Police Department and our Pawnee Mental Health Crisis co-responders who worked so hard for a safe outcome."
