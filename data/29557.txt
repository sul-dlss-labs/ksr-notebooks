HOMELAND, CA â€” A man who reportedly threatened his estranged wife at gunpoint while her two children were present in her home was shot and killed by a deputy in Homeland Tuesday night.

The man, whose identity has not been released, died at the residence in the 26000 block of Steinhoff Avenue in the unincorporated area between Hemet and Perris. According to a report released by Sheriff's Sgt. Lionel Murphy, deputies received information that the man had made threats to kill his estranged wife and he was armed with a handgun.

When deputies got to the home, the suspect fired at them, Murphy said. "At that time, a deputy-involved shooting occurred," he said. "The suspect was struck by the deputy's gunfire and ultimately succumbed to his injuries despite life-saving attempts performed by the deputies and AMR personnel."

The suspect's gun was recovered, Murphy said. No others were injured during the gunfire.
