The man shot and killed by a Department of Natural Resources officer in Dakota City has been identified.

Shane Allen Jensen, 20, of Humboldt, was fatally shot Saturday afternoon after firing a 9mm handgun into the air and then pointing it at officers, according to a Sunday press release from the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation.

According to the release, Jensen's family said he expressed thoughts of "suicide by cop" to them before stealing a vehicle.

When officers arrived on the scene, Jensen shot the gun into the air then pointed it at the officers. A DNR official shot Jensen, fatally wounding him.

The shooting is still being investigated.
