Family members protest case outside ACSO Published 12:10 am Tuesday, April 29, 2014

NATCHEZ — Family members of a Natchez man who died last week shortly after being tazed by an Adams County Sheriff’s Office deputy staged a protest Monday afternoon.

Betty Lou Davis, the mother of Tyrone Davis, held up a sign reading “No justice, no peace” at cars passing on State Street in front of the sheriff’s office Monday hoping to inform passersby of the incident that took her son’s life.

“We want justice, and we want the truth,” Betty Lou Davis said. “They killed my son.”

Tyrone Davis, 43, allegedly failed to comply with an ACSO deputy during a traffic stop near Robert Lewis Middle School at approximately 9 p.m. April 23, Sheriff Chuck Mayfield said at the time of the incident resulting in Davis being tazed.

Davis was transported to a hospital shortly after the incident and died later.

Mayfield said Friday the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation was investigating the incident, and also said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was notified.

Mayfield said he wouldn’t release further details regarding the incident until the full investigation was complete.

Don Barnes, Tyrone Davis’ brother-in-law who also participated in the protest, said the details of the incident didn’t add up to him.

“He was not driving the car, he was a passenger of the car, and the driver told us the deputies had said he was free to go,” Barnes said. “How do you go from getting let go to getting shocked to death?

“Resisting (arrest) doesn’t give you the right to take a life.”

Jimmie Davis, Tyrone Davis’ father, said he and others would continue seeking answers regarding his son’s death.

“We’re not going to let this go away,” Jimmie Davis said. “I want justice for my son.

“We’re going to get answers.”

Attempts to reach Mississippi Bureau of Investigation spokesman Warren Strain were unsuccessful Monday.
