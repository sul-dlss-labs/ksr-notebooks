Police responding to several calls for a person with a gun shot and killed a 33-year-old man in North Philadelphia after he allegedly pointed a gun at them late Thursday night.

Chief Inspector Scott Small said two responding officers from the 25th District, headquartered on Whitaker Avenue near Erie, spotted a man matching the description of the man with the weapon at 10th and Ontario streets shortly after 11:30 p.m. He was carrying a .357 Magnum revolver with a long barrel in his waistband, police said.

When the cops approached the man, he pulled the revolver out and pointed it at them, Small said. The officers ordered him to drop it several times before they both fired at him at least three times, hitting him in the chest and legs.

Investigators said even after the man was shot and dropped to the ground, he refused to drop his weapon. Police had to "pry" the gun out of his hand, cops said.

The man was rushed to Temple University Hospital in critical condition and was later pronounced dead at 1:03 a.m.

Police were on the scene, where a pool of blood on the street and the man's black sneaker marked the spot on the street where he fell.

Investigators do not believe the man fired any shots at the officers, and they were not injured in the confrontation.

At least five witnesses to the shooting were taken to speak with police, and cops from the Internal Affairs Division were on-scene to investigate.

As is standard protocol with police-involved shootings, both officers who fired their weapons were taken to Internal Affairs to give statements and will be placed on administrative duty pending outcome of the investigation.

The police-involved shooting happened at the same intersection as the crash at the end of a police pursuit in late March in which a suspect's car T-boned another vehicle, killing Danny Irizarry Roman.
