A 39-year-old man who was shot and killed by Milwaukee police Saturday was identified by a department spokeswoman Monday as Lon E. Paul.

Paul was wielding a knife and charging at two uniformed officers in the hallway of a rooming house in the 4500 block of N. 31st St. when he was shot shortly before 6 p.m., police spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz said.

Paul did not follow the officers' orders to drop his knife, Schwartz said. The officers tried to use their Tasers against him before he was shot, she said.

The officers had been called to the rooming house to investigate a report that a man was armed with a knife and that another person had already been injured, Schwartz said.

Neither officer was injured. Both officers - a 27-year-old man with two years of service and a 34-year-old man with eight years of service - have been placed on administrative duty, which is standard procedure after officers are involved in shootings.

The officers' names have not been released.
