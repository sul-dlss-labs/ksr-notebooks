Agents from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation say they are investigating an officer-involved shooting that left a 20-year-old woman dead and a suspect still at-large.

According to the TBI, Grundy County Sheriff's deputies tried to stop a vehicle Saturday night in rural Grundy County on B Mine Road, a rural road between Coalmont and Tracy City.

The driver of the vehicle pointed a gun at the deputy, who then fired several shots into the vehicle. The vehicle, which was facing the deputy's vehicle, then sped away, sideswiping the cruiser, according to the TBI.

The TBI initially identified a man they believed to be the driver. He was later determined to not be involved. Grundy County deputies continue searching for the driver.

About 20 minutes after the shooting, a citizen saw the driver and the vehicle crashed off the side of B Mine Road, and the driver told the citizen that he had been shot and needed help, according to the news release.

The driver asked for the citizen's vehicle, who drove away and called authorities.

When officers arrived, they found Shelby Comer in the vehicle. An autopsy will be conducted in Nashville to determine cause of death, the release said.

TBI agents investigate officer-involved shootings. District attorneys general file charges, if they feel there is enough evidence, the release said.
