Illinois State Police have been asked to help investigate the death of a 21-year-old man in a shootout with Maywood police.

Maywood police said Pierre M. Jackson, of the 1700 block of South 2nd Avenue, was shot Monday night near 5th Avenue and Van Buren Street after he fired at officers responding to a call of a shooting.

Maywood police declined to comment Tuesday. Illinois State Police Trooper Michelle Tufenkjian said she could not discuss the case other than to confirm that the agency was asked to help with the investigation.

Jackson's sister, Violet Jackson, said Maywood police told her they were unsure whether he was killed by police bullets or by someone else.

She said her brother was recently engaged to be married and was less than two weeks away from completing a sentence of house arrest for a minor conviction. He aspired toward a career in music, she said from her mother's home in Cicero.

Friends and family said Jackson was known by the nickname "The Grinch" because of his huge smile.

"I think the police were wrong to say he fired first," said lifelong friend Jason Sanders, 21. "Would you fire at somebody first if you had 10 days left on house arrest? Plus, it wasn't his character [to be violent]. I think he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time."

Sanders and other neighbors gathered outside Jackson's home Tuesday morning.

"We all grew up on this block together," said Lisa Edwards, 23. "It was hard for me to come out this morning and not see him."
