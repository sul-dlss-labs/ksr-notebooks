CHANHASSEN, Minn. -- A 17-year-old Hopkins boy died Friday when the vehicle he was driving crashed into another in Chanhassen after he apparently fled from a traffic stop.

Jordan Caplan was driving south on Hwy. 41 and going fast when his car hit another vehicle at Hwy. 5 at about 11:30 p.m., said South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Bryan Litsey.

A South Lake Minnetonka police officer clocked the youth's vehicle going about 90 mph in a 50 mph zone shortly after 11 p.m., Litsey said. The officer followed the vehicle before pulling it over on southbound Hwy. 41.

As the officer walked toward the stopped vehicle, the teen sped away, authorities said. The officer then lost sight of the vehicle near the intersection of the accident. When he arrived, he saw the wreckage.
