ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Bernalillo County authorities say a fugitive wanted in Colorado has died after he shot himself to avoid capture.

Sheriff's Capt. Joshua Kingsbury says deputies and U.S. marshals found 32-year-old Brandon Ledbetter in a stolen vehicle Saturday in northeast Albuquerque.

Kingsbury says Ledbetter, who was wanted on a parole violation, suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Kingsbury says two women and two men were also in the vehicle but were uninjured.

He says all four, who range in age from 22 to 32, also have outstanding warrants.

They have been booked on those warrants and additional charges related to vehicle theft.

Investigators are trying to determine their connection to Ledbetter.

A gun was also recovered from the scene.
