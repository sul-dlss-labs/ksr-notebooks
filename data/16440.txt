The deputy, Tiffany Oakley, was working the 7 p.m to 7 a.m. shift overnight and had gone home for her lunch break when "someone stepped out of the shadows and accosted her," Bradley County Sheriff's Office spokesman Ed Ramsey said this morning.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has identified the man shot as 23-year-old Allan F. White III.

Oakley's husband was not at home at the time.

The incident has been turned over to the TBI. The shooting happened in Cleveland in the 1400 block of Oak Tree Lane Southeast, TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said in a statement.

"The deputy tried to apprehend the subject and during the course of events fired her weapon at him. He later died at a local hospital," DeVine said.

Ramsey said the deputy was "all right" and was being checked out at a local hospital.

"It was a pretty strenuous fight and she was bruised up pretty good. From what I heard, he was out to do her in it surely sounded like," he said.

Ramsey said White was unknown to Oakley.

Oakley has been with the sheriff's office for two years, according to Sheriff Eric Watson. She has been placed on administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the TBI investigation, officials said

The TBI will release any further details on the attack, Ramsey said.

"Our agents are working to collect evidence and conduct any and all relevant interviews as the investigation progresses," DeVine said.
