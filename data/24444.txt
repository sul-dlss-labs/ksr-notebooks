TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - A man died in an officer-involved shooting on Tucson's east side early Sunday, July 8.

The Tucson Police Department said Craig Yelton, 34, was shot several times after he confronted officers while carrying a handgun.

The TPD said the incident began in the 100 block of North Understory Lane around midnight.

Officers were called to the scene for a fight involving weapons.

Yelton was armed and allegedly threatening neighbors he thought were responsible for loud music.

"Officers arrived on scene and made contact with the reporting party and also attempted to make contact with (Yelton)," the TPD said in a news release.

Officers then tried to get Yelton to come out of his home.

"A short time later, (Yelton) exited the residence and confronted the officers while armed with a handgun," the TPD said. "Four officers discharged their weapons."

Those four officers were:

Officer Ronald Engelkes, a 7-year veteran of the Tucson Police Department

Officer Colin Roberts, a 4 1/2-year veteran of the Tucson Police Department

Officer Kyle Walker, a 3-year veteran of the Tucson Police Department

Officer Peter Valenzuela, a 3-year veteran of the Tucson Police Department

Officers rendered first aid and called the paramedics, but Yelton was pronounced dead at the scene.

As with any officer-involved shooting, the TPD's Office of Professional Standards is investigating the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to call 88-CRIME.
