One man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in Laurel County.

Police say it happened Sunday afternoon on Highway 229, south of London.

Kentucky State Police say deputies were called out to the scene for reports of a man firing a gun outside of a home. When Laurel County deputies arrived, KSP says that man, 45-year-old Anthony McDonald, fired shots toward the deputies, with bullets hitting two cruisers.

Police say deputies fired back at McDonald, shooting and killing him.

"Anytime a law enforcement officer has to take another life, it's hard," Trooper Lloyd Cochran said. "Your alarm bells do go off when you respond to a call where officers are being told someone does have a firearm, so you are a little more prepared, but you just never know what's going to happen."

Three Laurel County Sheriff's deputies have been placed on administrative leave while the investigation is conducted. Police have not released their names.

"We want to remember them in prayer, for the people who were involved, the one who got killed and for the police department. You feel for them because you know they didn't want to do that," Robert Amburgey, who lives nearby, said.
