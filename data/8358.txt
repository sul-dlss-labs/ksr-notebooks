A Cleveland woman who was a passenger on a motorcycle being chased early Monday by police died when the driver apparently lost control and crashed.

Staci Elder, 37, was pronounced dead at Fairview Hospital.

The motorcycle was traveling around 95 mph on Interstate 480 when it passed Brook Park officer George Kosakowski, said Brook Park police Lt. Jim Foster.

Kosakowski, with lights and sirens on, followed the motorcycle, which exited at West 150th Street. The officer stopped the pursuit just south of Lorain Road and lost sight of the vehicle.

Kosakowski, who was unaware there was a passenger on the motorcycle, soon discovered it on the side of Warren Road in Cleveland, Foster said.

Cleveland police identified the driver as John Zurlo, 42. He was taken to MetroHealth Medical Center, where he was being treated.

No other vehicles appeared to be involved, and the Cleveland Police Department's Accident Investigation Unit is reviewing the incident, Foster said. He did not know whether the two were wearing helmets.

"There are a lot of unanswered questions right now," Foster said. "We're just trying to put the pieces together now."
