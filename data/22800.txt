A Henrico County man who died after crashing into a guardrail Saturday was one of three motorcyclists who eluded police on Interstate 95 while racing in and out of traffic at more than 100 mph, authorities disclosed today.

Erwin Brower, 27, of the 4400 block of Foxtail Lane died at the scene after crashing his Suzuki GSX-R600 racing bike on the ramp leading from southbound Chippenham Parkway to northbound I-95, said state police Sgt. Thomas Molnar.

A companion riding another bike, identified as Anthony L. Forbes, 25, also of Foxtail Lane, was arrested later at his home and charged with felony eluding police and reckless driving/racing. Molnar said the trooper chasing Forbes lost him during the pursuit but obtained his license plate number.

Brower and Forbes were in a group of three motorcyclists who were clocked by radar traveling more than 100 mph on northbound I-95, just south of the Chester exit, Molnar said.

"There were three bikes racing in and out of traffic," Molnar said.

A trooper was in pursuit but one of the three was able to escape without being identified. Forbes also managed to get away but not before the trooper got his license number.

The trooper chased Brower about 10 minutes from I-95 onto northbound Chippenham Parkway before the motorcyclist circled back and headed south on Chippenham towards I-95.

"When he entered the curve [on the ramp] at a high rate of speed, he lost control . . . and crashed into the guardrail there," Molnar said.

The pursuing trooper struck debris from the wrecked motorcycle but didn't hit Brower, Molnar said. Forbes is scheduled to appear Jan. 26 in Colonial Heights General District Court.
