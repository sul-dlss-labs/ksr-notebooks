LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — The Clark County Coroner identified Giovanni Cedano-Amaro, 21, as the suspect shot and killed by North Las Vegas Police on July 29. His death was ruled a homicide, caused by multiple gunshot wounds.

It happened just after 2 a.m. near Tonopah Avenue and Bruce Street. Officers responded to the area after receiving multiple reports that a man was walking in the streets with a gun.

Police were in the area questioning someone when they saw another person that fit the description of the armed man.

Officers approached Cedano-Amaro and saw that he was carrying a machete, according to North Las Vegas Police.

The officers gave him verbal commands, but he refused to comply and “lunged at the officers with the machete raised,” NLVPD stated in a news release.

Four officers fired and struck Cedano-Amaro multiple times. Officers immediately provided aid, according to the agency, and then he was transported to University Medical Center. He later succumbed to his injuries.

None of the officers were injured in the incident. The following officers involved include:

Forrest Walker, been with NLVPD for two years

Laura Meza, been with NLVPD for one year

Tyler Edwards, been with NLVPD for three years

Collin Francis — been with NLVPD for one year

The four officers are on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
