A Grants Pass man was fatally shot by an Oregon State Police trooper along Interstate 5 near Salem after authorities say he aimed a gun at troopers following a car chase.



Senior Trooper Jason Perrizo shortly after 5:30 p.m. Wednesday fired one shot at 35-year-old Jasper Levi Adams, who died at the scene, said Marion County Sheriff's Lt. Chris Baldridge. No one else was injured.



According to Baldridge, a trooper tried pulling over Adams' Ford Bronco on I-5 south of Woodburn, and a pursuit ensued when the driver didn't yield. The chase ended when the SUV went off the roadway south of Kuebler Road.



When Perrizo and at least one other trooper walked to the SUV, Adams aimed a loaded handgun at them, and Perrizo fired, Baldridge said.



What led to the traffic stop and further details of the case are not yet being released, Baldridge said. An autopsy for Adams will be done Friday. An investigation of the shooting is ongoing.



Court records show Adams was convicted of driving under the influence of intoxicants in Jackson County in 2004 and other minor traffic violations in Jackson and Josephine counties between 2001 and 2011. He also has other traffic violations in Washington between 2011 and 2015.

Adams' death was the first of two fatal shootings involving Oregon State Police troopers on Wednesday. Authorities say police fired on 36-year-old Andrew G. Dehart after he shot at law enforcement officers during a 17-mile chase along U.S. 26 in Washington County.
