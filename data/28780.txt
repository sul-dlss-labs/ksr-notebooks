GRAHAM, N.C. â€” Graham police made an arrest Thursday following a deadly crash in September, according to investigators.

Police said Davonn Bunting, 32, from Graham was arrested and charged with second degree murder and felony operating a motor vehicle while fleeing law enforcement after a 33-year-old woman died.

Graham police said Bunting was sent to the hospital September 13, following the police chase.

Detectives said Kalani Graves of Graham died after being trapped in the front passenger area of the car.

Police said Bunting was ejected from the car and suffered serious injuries.

Officers responded to a call of multiple gunshots fired near West Harden Street and Oneida Street.

Police said as they were pursuing the call, a dark Dodge passenger car passed one of the officers traveling at almost 70 miles per hour.

Due to the proximity of the shots fired call, it was believed the car may have been involved.

An officer tried to stop the car and the driver refused to stop, resulting in a chase. Investigators said the car continued through Graham and entered Burlington city limits on South Sellars Mill Road.

Almost a minute after the officer tried to stop the driver, they sped north through the intersection of South Sellars Mill and North Church Street losing control hitting a utility pole, multiple trees and a fence before stopping.

Investigators said both Graves and Bunting were taken to a trauma center.

Police said Graves unfortunately did not survive her injuries and died a short time after arriving to the hospital.

Bunting was treated for his injuries.
