CAMP PENDLETON – A police pursuit on southbound I-5 ended in a crash with the driver dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.

The California Highway Patrol has issued a SigAlert on the southbound lanes of the freeway near the San Onofre Border Patrol inspection facility as authorities investigate the crash and death.

The pursuit started near Doheny State Beach in Dana Point after the Orange County Sheriff’s Department received a report of a despondent woman in the area, Lt. Jeff Hallock said.

Officials were told the woman had made comments to her boyfriend threatening suicide, he said.

A deputy on patrol spotted the woman’s vehicle, but the driver took off, heading south on the freeway, Hallock said.

The driver lost control of the vehicle for an unknown reason and crashed near the San Onofre inspection facility.

The CHP issued a SigAlert at 1:30 p.m. for the two right southbound lanes, CHP officer Mary Bailey said.

A deputy approached the crashed vehicle and found the female driver dead from an apparent gunshot wound, Hallock said.

Sheriff’s officials are coordinating with San Diego officials to investigate the incident, he said.

Public transportation in San Diego County was also affected because of the incident.

The North County Transit District in San Diego County sent an alert via Twitter that tracks were closed between Oceanside and San Clemente because of police activity.

The woman’s identity has not been released.
