Before you throw out that old couch, consider donating it to Barnstable High School's prom committee for tomorrow's "after prom party."

The prom committee is looking for old sofas — about 10 — for partying prom attendees to have something to lounge or even sleep on at the Kennedy Rink recreation center in Hyannis.

"We're looking for unwanted couches but ones in fairly good condition," committee co-chair Carol Delaney said yesterday.

The post-prom party, which runs from 11 p.m. until 4 a.m., is an alcohol- and drug-free event chaperoned by teacher and parent volunteers.

"It's an effort to get (students) to stay all night so they're safe," Delaney said, noting that buses are being made available for students who may need a ride home from the rink.

Couch donors are being asked to call either Delaney at 508-737-4147 or committee co-chair Fran Paseo at 508-360-1202 to set up sofa drop-off arrangements.
