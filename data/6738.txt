Incident at 1400 Chenevert December 9, 2007 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of a robbery suspect at 1400 Chenevert about 2 p.m. on Saturday (Dec. 8) and asking for the public’s assistance in locating a second robbery suspect who fled the scene. The deceased suspect is identified as David Lee King Jr. (b/m, DOB 9-23-88). He suffered at least one gunshot wound and was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital where he was pronounced dead. A second suspect, Byron Ray Thomas (b/m, DOB 8-29-88), fled in a silver, four-door, late 90s model Ford Taurus that had partial license plate numbers of 890 as its last three numbers. Thomas has been charged with robbery - bodily injury in the 351st State District Court. The victim who shot the suspect was an off-duty Harris County Precinct 1 reserve deputy constable, Richard Jue, 49. He suffered bumps and contusions on his head, but did not require medical attention. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant G. Gonzales and Senior Police Officer R. Moreno reported: Mr. Jue was working as an attendant in a parking lot at 1400 Chenevert when he was approached by a suspect asking if he had change for a $100 bill. When Jue said he did not have change, the suspect left. The same suspect, along with another male, came back a short time later and parked in the lot and paid Jue with a $100 bill. Jue gave the suspect change and then walked away to use his cell phone. As Jue was on the phone, one of the suspects told him they didn’t want to park there and wanted their money back. Both suspects then began to strike Jue on his head and body, and pulled Jue’s reflective vest over his head. As Jue began to lose consciousness from the blows, he feared for his life and pulled a weapon from his waistband and fired shots, striking one of the suspects (King) in the torso area. The second suspect (Thomas) got into the silver Taurus and fled the scene. The wounded suspect managed to make his way across the street from the parking lot where he collapsed. Paramedics were called and transported him to the hospital. Mr. Jue said all money inside of his pocket was stolen during the robbery. Anyone with information on the whereabouts of suspect Byron Ray Thomas is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600 or Crime Stoppers at 713-222-TIPS. JFC 12-9-07
