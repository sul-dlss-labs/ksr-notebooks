A man suspected of killing his ex-wife and her male companion took his own life with a drug overdose, said Jackson County Coroner Vicki Broadus. The body of Edward Tanner was found Monday on his skiff after authorities chased him into the marsh between the two Pascagoula rivers. It was one of two manhunts handled by the Jackson County Sheriff's Department on Monday. In the other, investigators were still looking for a Florida man wanted for questioning in the stabbing death of an Escatawpa man on Sunday night.

Authorities spent more than 15 hours searching for Tanner. He was suspected in the shooting death of Lisa Tanner, 36, around 8 p.m. Sunday outside her mobile home in the Three Rivers community. He also is believed to have shot and killed Jimmy Piechocki, 28, of Indiana, who was with her, said Jackson County Sheriff Mike Byrd. Inside was the 14-year-old daughter of Lisa Tanner, investigators said. Authorities believe Tanner was armed when he fled in a skiff on Sunday night. Investigators followed, but called off the search because of fog on the water. They resumed on Monday, and Byrd, a deputy and two Pascagoula police officers found Tanner's boat at about 12:30 p.m. with his body draped over the bow.

Authorities have not yet released the identity of the stabbing victim. Authorities said they are searching for Donald Hughes of Florida, who left the victim's house in an SUV or minivan.
