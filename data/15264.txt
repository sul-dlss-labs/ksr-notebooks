A man armed with a handgun was fatally shot by a police officer in Huntington Beach on Saturday, officials said.

Following reports of a reckless driver in a dark-colored SUV who may have been forcing other vehicles off the road, officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop about 5:30 p.m. near the intersection of Gothard Street and Ernest Drive (map), said Lt. Kent Ferrin of the Huntington Beach Police Department.

After being involved in a minor collision at the intersection, a man carrying a gun exited the vehicle he was driving and walked up the driveway of a residence, Ferrin said.

According to officials, when police ordered the suspect to stop, he turned and pointed the gun at an officer.

The officer fired multiple rounds, striking the suspect at least once, Ferrin said. No one else was injured.

Police administered first aid to the wounded man before paramedics arrived and transported him to UCI Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said. He was later identified by the Orange County coroner’s office as Daniel Walsh, 27, of Huntington Beach.

The name of the officer who opened fire was not immediately released.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Department was investigating the shooting, in accordance with standard procedure. Anyone with information is asked to call the OCSD’s Homicide Division at 714-647-7055.
