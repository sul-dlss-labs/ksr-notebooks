Officers responded to a call about an attempted carjacking in the 400 block of Fairview Street about 1:30 p.m., Chief Neil Noakes said at a news conference Monday afternoon.

Responding officers later found the suspect in the 3600 block of Race Street, Noakes said.

The suspect pulled a gun when one of the officers approached and ignored repeated orders to drop the weapon, Noakes said.

The officer shot the suspect, a 31-year-old Black man, who later died at a hospital. The Tarrant County medical examiner’s office identified him as Ryan Oneal Williams.

The video shows the officer getting out of his car and running towards Williams, who was on the sidewalk next to a car. The officer then yells “put the gun down, put it down” before six gunshots are heard.

A version of the video that was slowed down showed that Williams was turned slightly and his right arm was extended towards the officer. Noakes said a witness told police that the man had a gun in his right hand and pointed it at the officer.

The man may have fired his gun once, Noakes said, but further investigation will be needed.

The officer, who has not been publicly identified, has been employed with the department for four years.

Noakes said the officer will be on administrative leave while the department investigates, which is routine in police-involved shootings.

“At the Fort Worth Police Department, we greatly appreciate and understand the sanctity of all human life,” the chief said. “We also understand the trust that we need to build and continue to enhance with the community we serve. This investigation will be one that’s conducted with transparency so we can continue to work on that trust.”
