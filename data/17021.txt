By Staff Reports

The Ventura County Sheriff's Office identified Monday the deputy who shot and killed a Camarillo man during an altercation last week.

Deputy Leon Mah has been with the agency for more than nine years. He has been assigned to the Ojai patrol station since November 2010, officials said.

He was working overtime Wednesday, filling a Camarillo shift, when he shot and killed Bryant Neil Duncan, 23. Like Ojai, Camarillo contracts with the Sheriff's Office to provide law enforcement.

Officials said Monday that Mah became certified in crisis intervention in 2013 after completing a 40-hour course.

Duncan took a cordless phone from the 7-Eleven store at Carmen and Daily drives about 11:50 a.m. and called 911 to say a crime was going to happen and he wanted police to kill him, sheriff's officials said.

Duncan crossed Carmen Drive, and then the deputy pulled up in his patrol car. With the phone in one hand and the knife in the other, Duncan told Mah he wanted to be killed and repeatedly asked to be shot.

The deputy kept his distance and asked Duncan to put down the knife, but the man kept coming at him, officials said. As Duncan got 2 or 3 feet away, the deputy feared for his life and shot the man multiple times, authorities said.

Duncan was taken to Los Robles Hospital & Medical Center in Thousand Oaks and later died.

Mah was treated for scrapes at the scene and not taken to a hospital.

He now is on administrative leave, which is standard practice after an officer-involved shooting, but is expected to return to work later this week, officials said.
