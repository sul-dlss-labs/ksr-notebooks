NEW ORLEANS (WVUE) - Two teenagers killed after a police chase and crash into a Central City beauty salon have been identified.

Byron Wilson, Jr., 16 and Chimelu Collins, 14, both died of “thermal injuries” brought on by the fiery crash, according to the Orleans Parish Coroner’s Office.

The fire started after police tried to stop Wilson and Collins, who were driving a suspected stolen car.

New Orleans Police Chief Sean Ferguson said instead of pulling over, the car tried to flee, speeding away and ultimately hitting a tree before crashing into Unity-1.

The fire ignited soon after, gutting the insides of the neighborhood institution.

Both the boys inside the car were killed in the crash.

Schwann Herbert, 54, was also killed. A longtime customer of the salon, Schwann was on the second floor getting her hair done when the flames erupted.

Other people in the salon, including two children were rescued by first responders or able to escape on their own.

The crash happened on March 20 near the corner of Washington Ave. and South White St.
