SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) – A spokesman for the Santa Fe County Sheriff’s Office says an armed man has taken his own life after being confronted by law enforcement in the Rancho Viejo area on the southern outskirts of Santa Fe.

Sheriff’s Office spokesman Juan Rios said an armed man took his life in an open field near the Santa Maria de la Paz church on Friday evening at about the time the sun was setting. Deputies had shut down roads in the area as they responded to a report of a distraught, armed man.

Rios says a helicopter from the Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Department assisted in the response by law enforcement. He declined to release more information about the identity of the man who died or how police were alerted to the situation.
