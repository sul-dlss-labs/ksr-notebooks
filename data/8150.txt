A Maywood man who was shot by Chicago police in June after he tried to run three officers down with a car died today, authorities said.



Mario Johnson, 30, of the 700 block of South 8th Avenue was pronounced dead at 5:47 a.m. at Kindred Hospital, a long-term care facility, a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said.



Johnson died of gunshot wounds he sustained in June. Johnson was shot on the 2300 block of West Madison Street after police said he struck three narcotics officers with his vehicle. An autopsy is scheduled for Sunday.



An investigation into Johnson's shooting and now his death has not concluded and is ongoing, said Mark Payne, a spokesman for the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates all police-involved shootings.
