The Providence County Grand Jury today concluded its investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the shooting death of Jamie Coyle, with a last known address of Attleboro, MA, by two officers of the Pawtucket Police Department on May 2, 2012. The Providence County Grand Jury declined to return indictments against any member of the Pawtucket Police Department.

The Providence County Grand Jury found that the actions of the officers were legally justified.

Consistent with the practice in cases of this kind, the Office of Attorney General brought the matter before a Grand Jury to promote integrity in the process and trust in the outcome. It is the responsibility of the Grand Jury to determine the facts, apply the law to those facts and to decide whether anyone may be charged with criminal wrongdoing.

The Office of Attorney General cannot release further details surrounding the Grand Jury as disclosure is prohibited by law.
