Mr. Branch was involved in “a prior relationship” with the woman he shot, Patricia Mohammed, said Robert K. Boyce, the chief of detectives for the New York Police Department.

In the minutes after the shooting, Mr. Branch sent a series of harassing text messages to a man who was with Ms. Mohammed just before the shooting, but who was not injured, Chief Boyce said. In those messages Mr. Branch referred to himself as “the grim reaper,” the chief said. He also called relatives of Ms. Mohammed, “taunting them as well,” he said.

Chief Boyce provided details as he stood near the location of the Brooklyn shooting, on Pennsylvania Avenue, near a rented white Dodge Charger he said Mr. Branch had been driving.

Retracing the events of the morning, the chief said 911 callers alerted the police to the shooting at the casino, near the Aqueduct racetrack, around 2:20 a.m.

There, in the casino’s parking lot, Mr. Branch pulled up to Ms. Mohammed and the 51-year-old man, who were standing outside her black Chrysler, speaking.
