Crime & Safety Man Killed by Deputy While Stabbing Wife on Courthouse Steps Identified Police released the name of a 55-year-old man who was shot as he chased and stabbed his estranged wife up the courthouse steps. Reply

CHATSWORTH, CA -- Authorities Tuesday released the name of a man who was fatally shot at the Chatsworth courthouse by a sheriff's deputy after repeatedly stabbing his estranged wife, who remains hospitalized.

The shooting occurred about noon Monday and forced the closure of the courthouse at 9425 Penfield Ave. for the rest of the day. Jose Armando Cueva, 55, died at a hospital, said coroner's Assistant Chief Ed Winter. His home town was not known.

Upon their arrival at the courthouse in a black Audi sedan, the two got into "a verbal altercation" while still in the car, said Deputy Kimberly Alexander of the Sheriff's Information Bureau. "The victim was driving when the suspect stabbed her," Alexander said. "The victim was able to exit the vehicle and run toward the courthouse entrance doors."

Cueva caught up with his wife as she climbed the courthouse steps "and continued to stab her with a large knife," Alexander said. "A deputy and a security officer confronted the suspect and ordered him to drop the weapon," Alexander said. "The suspect did not comply and a deputy-involved shooting occurred."
