Videotape Shows Man Killed In KC Police Shooting Was Armed

Police in Kansas City have gone public with a videotape shot from a police car that shows a man running away from a wrecked car with a gun in his hand. A short time later, out of camera range, a policeman shot the man who said he had turned on him with the gun. Police say Juan Jacquez was driving a car that left the scene of an accident and was pursued by a police car until Jacquez stopped, jumped out and ran. Officers later determined the gun he had was not loaded.
