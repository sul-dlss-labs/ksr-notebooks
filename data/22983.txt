Cincinnati police have identified three men killed in a crash after fleeing a traffic stop.It started just after midnight on Wednesday with an attempted traffic stop near Caldwell Drive and Vine Street in Springfield Township.Officers said they tried to stop a car driven by 36-year-old Mussah Pierre after spotting a lane violation. Police then ran the car's license plate, which pointed to multiple driving suspensions.When police tried to pull Pierre over, he took off with two other men in the car, 35-year-old John Edwards and 21-year-old Jermaine Tucker.One officer also said one of the passengers threw something out one of the car's windows.Police said because Pierre's car was going so fast on North Bend Road, the officers didn't chase it.About a mile later, the car went airborne, clipping a car parked in Kimberly Stall's driveway before hitting her neighbor's pine tree in Carthage."It sounded like something exploded," Stall said. "Everybody ran down here and (saw) the car there. We didn't know how many people was in it. It was awful."Stall's next door neighbor Bob Guth said he's never seen such a bad crash."Nothing like this," he said. "They said they were going over a hundred miles an hour when they hit the tracks. And somebody was coming this way and seen it and said they went airborne when they went over the tracks and then lost it and you can see the skid marks. Looks like they were already, you know, skidding on their side when they came into here. Knocked the window out of the house. Knocked the windows out of the car. ... It's terrible."On Wednesday afternoon, three men showed up at the scene of the crash and said they lost a brother when Pierre, nicknamed Bear, died."Bear was a good guy," one of the men said, declining to share his name. "He was trying to get his life together. (You) know what I mean? You know, we all go through stuff. But he was progressing. It's just a sad day for our family, bro. Just need everybody to keep my aunt and her kids in prayers."Police said none of the crash victims was wearing a seat belt and said excessive speed was a factor.Also, police in Springfield Township said officers found multiple handguns and marijuana in the car that crashed.
