An Androscoggin County teen was killed early Friday morning when the car she was in crashed in Turner during a police chase.

Julie Beaucage, 18, of Turner, was a passenger who died when a Honda Accord came off Route 4 near North Shore Drive and hit a utility pole, Androscoggin County sheriffs said Friday afternoon.

An Androscoggin sheriffâ€™s deputy spotted a speeding vehicle heading southbound on Route 4 in Turner and passing other vehicles about 2:50 a.m., according to Chief Deputy William Gagne.

The deputy flashed his lights but the vehicle sped away and almost struck a northbound Maine State Police cruiser, Gagne said.

The driver lost control of the vehicle near North Shore Drive and left the road before striking a utility pole, according to Gagne.

Beaucage died at the scene. The driver, 19-year-old Spencer Dowd of Auburn, and passenger Keegan Pelletietier, 19 of Auburn, were extricated from the vehicle and taken to Central Maine Medical Center in Lewiston.

The crash remains under investigation.
