Two Sacramento police officers involved in the February shooting death of an unarmed African American man will not face criminal charges, Sacramento County district attorney officials said.

Donald “D.J.” Venerable, 33, was shot while clutching a cell phone after officers responded to a domestic dispute, according to police.

The shooting was a “reasonable response” to Venerable’s “violent conduct before he was shot,” said Assistant Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Alpert Locher.

The shooting has drawn criticism from civil rights groups, which say it was a result of over-aggressive police tactics that target minorities.
