A person died Thursday after a pursuit by Garden Grove police into Westminster led to an officer-involved shooting.

The shooting occurred about 3:40 p.m. in the 10000 block of Bolsa Avenue, near Brookhurst Street. Westminster police responded to the location to assist Garden Grove officers, Westminster Police Department Cmdr. Alan Iwashita said.

Garden Grove police told reporters at the scene detectives had been investigating in the area prior to the shooting.

The SUV smashed into a brick wall near a church after the shooting and at least two unmarked police vehicles were damaged in the pursuit, according reports from the scene.

A church security guard told reporters he heard at least five gunshots, then a crash.

No officers were injured and the shooting was under investigation by the Orange County District Attorney's Office Investigations Bureau, Iwashita said.

The name of the person killed was not disclosed.
