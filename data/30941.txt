PHOENIX â€” A man died in police custody early Friday morning after being handcuffed and restrained by officers, the Phoenix Police Department said.

Police got calls saying a man was reportedly walking in a roadway naked around 1 a.m., the department's public information officer said. The man started "acting erratically" and speaking in a way officers couldn't understand when police arrived.

Officers handcuffed him, put him on the ground and turned him on his side before he died, police said. The man lost consciousness when Phoenix Fire Department personnel were beginning their medical evaluation at the scene.

He was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead, officers said.
