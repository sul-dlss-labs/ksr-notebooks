Police say a robbery suspect died after being shot by an off-duty SWAT officer in Philadelphia's Olney section.

OLNEY (WPVI) -- Investigators tell Action News the deadly shooting of a robbery suspect by an off-duty Philadelphia SWAT officer Saturday was justified.

Viewer video shows the aftermath of the police-involved shooting.

The incident happened around 2:20 p.m. Saturday on the 5700 block of Park Avenue.

Police say the officer intervened when he saw the armed suspect robbing an elderly citizen. After identifying himself as police, the officer ordered the suspect to drop his weapon.

The alleged robber then pointed a gun at the officer who fired his weapon, police say. The suspect fled on foot with the officer in pursuit.

Police say during the foot chase, the suspect fired his gun at the officer and the officer returned fire.

The suspect eventually collapsed in front of a mobile phone store on Broad and Chew streets where witness Bryan Hines was watching.

"You could see where he got shot at on the hip," said Hines. "He wasn't moving. He kept saying don't move, but we knew he wasn't going to move."

Police backup arrived, and an officer quickly removed an object from the suspect.

"I watched them take the gun off him," said Hines. "He had like a .32 chrome revolver."

Police picked up the suspect and placed him in an SUV, which took him to Einstein Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 3:06 p.m.

Police say the robbery victim was roughed up, but will be OK.

The officer's name is not being released, but police say he was not hurt.
