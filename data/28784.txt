MCRAE-HELENA, Ga. — The GBI is investigating after a Ben Hill County murder suspect killed himself following a police chase.

According to a news release from the GBI, their Eastman office was requested by Georgia State Patrol and the Telfair County Sheriff’s Office Sunday to investigate the death of Keith Wendell Wilcox, 43.

Their preliminary investigation shows a BOLO was issued for a suspect in a shooting investigation in Fitzgerald that happened around 6:45 p.m.

McRae-Helena Police Chief Glenn Giles told 13WMAZ that shooting left one person dead and another injured.

The GBI says Telfair County deputies saw the vehicle from the BOLO on Highway 441 near Workmore.

The deputy tried to stop the vehicle and a chase started.

The GBI says that, during the chase, two children that were inside the vehicle were dropped off at a family member’s home in McRae-Helena.

A GSP Trooper ended the chase by conducting a PIT maneuver on the vehicle near Highway 341 around 7:15 p.m.

The GBI says Wilcox got out of the vehicle with a handgun and shot himself. He died at the scene.

Wilcox’s body will be taken to the GBI Crime Lab for an autopsy.
