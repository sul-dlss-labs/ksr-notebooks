A 33-year-old motorcyclist died last night while cops were following a group of reckless motorcyclists in Brooklyn, police sources said.

The man was riding on Jamaica Avenue in East New York at around 8:30 p.m. with a number of other motorcyclists when he skidded out and slammed into the back of a parked car, sources said.

A police car was following the group without lights and sirens because they were allegedly driving erratically, according to the source. That’s when a man identified as Eric Zaman, 33, of Queens skidded out and slammed into the back of a parked Honda Accord, cops said.

Witnesses at the scene told The Post that the officer’s vehicle clipped Zaman’s motorcycle, sending skidding out of control.

Police, however, maintain that Zaman lost control because he was speeding and said the police car never struck his 2001 Yamaha motorcycle, sources said.

The investigation is ongoing.

Last August in the Bronx, a cruiser slammed into two men riding a dirtbike, killing one.
