A man who fled police Sunday afternoon fatally shot himself in the head in the Back of Yards neighborhood.

Just after 1 p.m., 30-year-old Denell Edmondson was driving and police attempted to pull him over, but he drove off and crashed into a parked vehicle, according to Chicago police and the Cook County medical examiner’s office.

Edmondson exited his vehicle in the 4900 block of South Marshfield Avenue, took out a handgun and shot himself in the head, authorities said.

About 10 minutes later, he was pronounced dead at the scene, and a weapon was recovered, authorities said.

An autopsy Monday found Edmondson died of a gunshot wound to the head and his death was ruled a suicide, according to the medical examiner’s office. He lived in the Washington Park neighborhood.

Police said Sunday evening that the shooting was being investigated by the Civilian Office of Police Accountability and Area Central detectives.
