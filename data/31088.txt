NATIONAL CITY, Calif. â€” A man who police say was armed with a machete was killed Friday morning when two officers shot him in National City.

The National City Police Department said its officers were called around 4:20 a.m. to a self-storage facility off Highway 54. Someone at the business told police there was a man on the property who was armed with a knife.

Officers got the area and found a man with a machete, according to NCPD. Officers tried to detain the man but he refused, which led them to use a taser. An NCPD spokesperson said the man then threatened officers, leading two officers to shoot him near 33rd Street and Hoover Avenue.

Onscene.TV video showed first responders tending to the man down on the sidewalk with a large knife on the ground nearby. A police spokesperson said in an 8:30 a.m. update that the man died after being shot despite life-saving efforts.

Neither officer involved was hurt, and both were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard protocol when an officer fires their weapon.

The NCPD spokesperson said what led up to the shooting is still under investigation.
