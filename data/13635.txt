Virginia Beach, Va. - Virginia Beach Police are now investigating after a man was shot and killed by police during a barricade situation on Wednesday night.

They say this happened in the 500 block of Bay Cove Quay.

Police say they were dispatched to the residence after a woman called to report that her husband had locked himself in the bathroom and threatened to harm himself.

When officers arrived at the time, the woman and her 5-year-old had left the house.

The man inside the home, identified as 30-year-old Shane Whitworth, told police that he had weapons and was not coming out. Officers also say they heard the slide of a firearm being racked.

Whitworth eventually left the house through the back door, armed with a handgun. He fired the gun once before hiding under a trampoline. He then got a ladder and climbed over the back fence.

Once he got over the fence, still armed with a gun, officers fired at him.

"I heard gunshots and then ambulances rushing in, I guess to take care of whatever was going on with the police department," says Dale Lamayine, a witness.

Witnesses say they heard multiple gunshots, police won't say how many times the man was hit by police.

Once the scene was safe, the officers and paramedics immediately began rescue efforts and CPR, but they were unsuccessful. Whitworth was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police won't specify the relationship Whitworth had with the woman or child, only that they are now safe.

As is standard in all officer-involved shootings, the Virginia Beach Police Department’s Investigative Division and the Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney, as well as the Office of Internal Affairs, are continuing their investigations into this incident.

In accordance with department policy, the involved officer has been placed on administrative assignment, pending the outcome of this investigation.
