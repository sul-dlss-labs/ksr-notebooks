SPOKANE — Three Spokane police officers who killed a homicide suspect in April will not face criminal charges.

The Spokane County Prosecutor’s Office made that announcement Monday.

37-year-old Jeremy Arnold appeared at his home moments after authorities concluded a news conference about a body discovered at the home.

While a television crew filmed the encounter, Arnold left his truck with what appeared to be a gun in his hand and was shot dead by police. Police say Arnold was actually carrying a metallic pellet gun.

Authorities later identified Arnold as a person of interest in the death of the woman who was found dead in Arnold’s home.
