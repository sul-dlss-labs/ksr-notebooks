The man who killed himself in front of a Gwinnett police officer Nov. 25 was identified Monday as 61-year-old Heping Sheng of unincorporated Lawrenceville.

Officers responded to a Resthaven Drive home shortly after 2 p.m. due to a residential alarm, according to Cpl. Jake Smith with Gwinnett County police. Sheng opened the door and answered an officer’s questions before pulling out a gun, according to police.

“After a few seconds the male produced a handgun and committed suicide,” Smith said in an emailed statement. “The male did not attempt to engage the officer before shooting himself.”

Inside the home, officers found the body of Sheng’s wife, 58-year-old Fu Li. She appeared to have been shot to death.

Investigators have not determined a motive.

The couple is survived by a daughter, Christy Sheng, of Lawrenceville.
