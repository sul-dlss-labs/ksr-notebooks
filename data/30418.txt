The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating the death of a man who died Monday while in Mt. Juliet police custody.

The death occurred after officers responded to a report of an "unruly guest" at a home in the 3100 block of West Division Street and used a stun gun on a man.

A distraught woman called 911 saying an unknown man was in her home, Mt. Juliet police said.

The man was sweating, destroying property and not speaking clearly, according to police.

Officers believed the man showed indications of a substance overdose and impairment. The man became combative toward two officers who used compliance techniques to try and gain control, which included use of a stun gun on his leg, according to police.

The man stopped being combative and officers were able to handcuff him, police said.

An officer noticed the man was not breathing while handcuffed. Officers removed the handcuffs and began CPR. The man was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Mt. Juliet Police requested the TBI investigation through District Attorney's office, Mt. Juliet Police Capt. Tyler Chandler said.

An autopsy will be included, District Attorney General Jason Lawson said.

Officers involved are placed "routine administrative leave," Mt. Juliet Chief of Police James Hambrick said.

No further information was immediately released.
