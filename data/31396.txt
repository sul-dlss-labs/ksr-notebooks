DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — A suspect died and an officer chasing him across a Des Moines street was injured when both were hit by a car, police said.

The incident began Monday night when the officer spotted a van driving in reverse on a city street, then pull into a parking lot, police said in a news release. Police said the officer stopped and questioned the van’s driver, who reportedly gave a false name and then fled on foot.

The officer gave chase, and a struggle between two men occurred, investigators believe.

The crash happened just before 8 p.m. Monday after the officer radioed for help, saying he was involved in a violent encounter with a suspect. Police say that about a minute after that call, emergency dispatchers began receiving calls that an officer and a man he was chasing had been hit by a car.

Police said investigators believe that as the two struggled, the 31-year-old suspect ran into SE 14th Street, followed by the officer, and both men were hit by a vehicle. Both were rushed to a hospital, where the suspect died. The 48-year-old officer remained hospitalized Tuesday.
