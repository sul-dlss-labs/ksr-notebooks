Police in Detroit say a man was fatally shot at the end of a car chase that began when crime suspects refused to stop.

Officer Dan Donakowski says shots were fired Monday when a man started to drive toward officers after the car was surrounded. One person was killed and another was wounded. The chase included a pursuit on Interstate 75.

The Wayne County Medical Examiner identified the man killed as 41-year-old Kevin Pudlik, a passenger in the vehicle.

Police Chief James Craig says two guns were recovered from the car. He says the vehicle was involved in a weekend shooting that was under investigation.

The chase started around 2:30 p.m. on I-75 and Michigan State Police and Detroit police chased the vehicle on and off the highway.

A police car eventually used the “pit maneuver” on the vehicle, but the suspect managed to gain control of his vehicle. He was boxed in by multiple police cars – but still managed to get away.

After taking the sidewalk, officers managed to do the pit maneuver on the vehicle, and successfully pinning his vehicle in between numerous police cruisers.

Despite being pinned in a final time, the suspect tried ramming into officers. Officers fired shots at the car, forcing the man to surrender.
