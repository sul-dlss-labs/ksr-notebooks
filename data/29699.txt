ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – Police are currently investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting in northeast Albuquerque Saturday. Roadways are currently closed at the intersection of San Mateo and Copper NE and officials say will most likely be closed the rest of the evening.

Officials say officers responded to calls of a man walking in the street on San Mateo near Copper. When police arrived, they attempted to get the suspect out of the roadway but he wouldn’t cooperate.

Officers deployed a taser at the suspect and that’s when the suspect reportedly charged at police and the officers shot at the suspect. Police say the suspect was transported to a hospital but died from their wounds.

An officer suffered a minor laceration and was treated at the scene. A knife was also found at the scene.

“One of our officers did sustain a superficial wound and a knife was recovered at the scene,” said Interim APD Chief Harold Medina. “We don’t know the exact circumstances and we haven’t spoken to the officers.”

What exactly led up to the shooting is still under investigation. No other information has been released at this time.
