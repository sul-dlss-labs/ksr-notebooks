POMPANO BEACH, Fla. â€“ A suspect in a Port St. Lucie bank robbery is dead after a deputy-involved shooting in Pompano Beach.

The fatal shooting happened just before 9 a.m. Thursday at 1347 Sample Road.

Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel said deputies received a tip from the FBI and Port St. Lucie police that the suspect, identified as Charles Allen Ziegler, 40, was at a home in Pompano Beach. Members of the Broward Sheriff's Office violence intervention proactive enforcement response team found Ziegler's white Lexus at a nearby home and followed him to the parking lot of Mission Critical Systems, where they attempted to arrest him.

Israel said Ziegler got into a struggle with the deputies, broke free and reached under the floorboard of the car and pulled out a .44 Magnum revolver.

"Four deputies fired simultaneously," Israel said. "Tragically, the suspect succumbed to his wounds."

Ziegler is believed to be responsible for a Wednesday morning robbery at a Wells Fargo bank branch in Port St. Lucie.

Israel said a woman in the car was not hurt. The sheriff didn't say what her relationship was to Ziegler, but she was being questioned by detectives.

"At this time we have no reason to believe she was involved," Israel said.

No deputies were injured in the shooting.

Sample Road was closed between Federal and Dixie highways during the investigation.

The four deputies who fired their weapons will be on administrative leave for at least three days per standard protocol as the investigation is conducted.
