POUGHKEEPSIE >> A four-year veteran of the city police department was the officer who fired the shots that killed an armed suspect this week, the department said on Wednesday in releasing the identities of both men.

Police identified the officer as Anthony Vigna and the deceased as William L. Daniels, 29.

Daniels was killed late Monday after confronting police officers responding to a 911 call from a woman at 12 S. Clinton St. who said a man in her apartment had smoked angel dust and was really “messed up and tripping” and acting violently, police said.

When officers arrived, the police department said, Daniels lunged at them with a knife, ignored orders to stop and withstood the use of a Taser and baton. He then lunged toward one officer with the knife again and was shot twice by Vigna, the department said.

Daniels was treated at the scene and then taken to a hospital, where he died, police said.

The Poughkeepsie Journal has reported the three officers involved in the incident have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such matters.

The Dutchess County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the case.
