The L.A. Sheriff's Department says Jose Toloza ran from sheriff's deputies after they confronted him on a Compton Street Wednesday around 7:40pm.

After a foot pursuit, says public information officer Deputy Peter Gomez, Toloza fought with deputies and tried to grab one of their guns. At least one deputy shot Toloza and he died at the scene.

Coroner's officials said Friday that an autopsy has not been conducted. Toloza, 35, lived in Paramount.

The sheriff's department declined to say why deputies approached Toloza to begin with.

Investigators from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, L.A. County District Attorney's Office, and Office of Independent Review plan to review the circumstances of Toloza's death.
