SPICELAND, Ind. (ADAMS) – It looks like the man who shot at Henry County deputies after a domestic violence call took his own life. Investigators say 77-year-old Leslie Odier barricaded himself in a back bedroom of his house Wednesday.

Around 7 p.m. Henry County Deputies responded to a home in the 2200 block of CR 700 South, just east of the town of Spiceland, for a domestic situation between an elderly male and his wife. As deputies arrived an elderly male armed with handguns exited the home, fired shots then went back inside. The man’s wife was able to leave the home prior to officers arriving.

Henry County SWAT arrived at the home to assist deputies. At some point the male exited the home again pointing and firing a handgun at deputies, who returned fire. The man fled back into the home and a short time later officers heard a single gunshot inside the home.

Indiana State Police SWAT and Negotiators were sent to the scene. After numerous failed attempts to contact the man, Indiana State Police SWAT made entry into the home around 11:00 p.m. and found the man, Leslie Odier, age 77, deceased. At that time the Henry County Sheriff’s Department asked the Indiana State Police Pendleton District to take over the investigation.

The investigation remains ongoing, and there is no further information to release at this time. An autopsy will be performed to determine Mr. Odier’s exact cause of death.
