BOONE, Iowa — The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is handling the investigation into an officer-involved shooting that left one man dead in Boone late Monday night.

Boone County law enforcement says the shooting happened near 332 W. 2nd Street. Officers were called to respond around 10:15 p.m. on a report of a man with a gun threatening people.

When officers arrived they found a man who matched the suspect’s description. While talking with him, officers say the man took a gun out of his waistband. Officers ordered him to drop the gun but he refused and raised it, pointing the weapon at officers and walking toward them.

Officers then fired on the suspect. He was taken to a local hospital where he died from his injuries.

An autopsy is being performed Tuesday at the State Medical Examiner’s Office in Ankeny.

The name of the man, nor the name of the officers involved in the shooting, are being released at this time.

The officers have been placed on paid administrative leave until the DCI’s investigation into the incident is complete.
