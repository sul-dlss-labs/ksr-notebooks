DENVER (AP) â€” Prosecutors say they won't file charges against an Adams County deputy who shot and killed a 17-year-old suspect because the teen had pointed a handgun at the officer.

In a report released Friday, District Attorney Dave Young said Deputy Isaiah Acosta believed his life was in danger when he shot Adrian Emmanuel Martinez 13 times on July 7.

The Denver Post reports that deputies were investigating a party when Martinez and others fled, first in a car and then on foot after the car crashed.

Acosta was in a patrol car when he spotted Martinez on foot. Authorities say Martinez fell, and Acosta ordered him to stay on the ground, but Martinez pulled a handgun as he got back to his feet.

Authorities say that's when Acosta shot Martinez.
