Despite hospital swine flu, babies will not be treated

FAYETTEVILLE — A hospital spokeswoman says babies in the neonatal intensive care unit at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center won’t receive antiviral drugs, although an employee has tested positive for swine flu.

The Fayetteville Observer reports that spokeswoman Janet Conway says doctors believe the babies’ risk for contact with the virus is extremely low. She says doctors also considered the risk of side effects to the babies from the antiviral drugs. Conway couldn’t say what the employee does specifically. She says staff members are at a greater risk of catching the flu and are being treated.
