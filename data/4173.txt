ASHVILLE, Ala. (AP)_St. Clair County Sheriff Terry Surles says a second deputy will be assigned for long distance trips with inmates. The escape of a twice-convicted murderer, who was killed in a shootout in Montgomery, prompted the policy change.

Ronald Stallworth escaped May fifth while being taken by a deputy from Holman Prison in Atmore to St. Clair County for a court hearing. Stallworth stole Deputy Glenn Wilson's car and gun on Alabama 145 in Chilton County. He fled south on Interstate 65 and was shot to death in a gunbattle on the interstate.

Surles said the Alabama Department of Corrections should be responsible for taking inmates to court hearings and he plans to study the issue to see if an agreement could be reached for the state to handle more transports.

Department of Corrections spokesman Brian Corbett said he didn't know if the prison system would be willing or able to take on that responsibility.

In 1989, Stallworth pleaded guilty to the murders of two women in Macon County. He was charged with killing an inmate in St. Clair Correctional Facility in 2003.
