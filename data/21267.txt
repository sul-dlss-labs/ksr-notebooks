BATTLE CREEK, Mich. — A Battle Creek man shot and killed himself after a Calhoun County deputy stopped his car for a traffic violation early Monday morning.

William Cook, 23, of Battle Creek, held a stolen .45-caliber handgun to his head and pulled the trigger at the end of a two-minute standoff with the deputy, according to Capt. Matt Saxton of the Calhoun County Sheriff Department.

Saxton said the 10-year deputy, whose name was not released, stopped Cook about 3 a.m. at the intersection of Wagner Drive and Roosevelt Avenue on the south side of Bailey Park in Pennfield Township. Captain Matt Saxton said a deputy stopped the driver for erratic driving and found the man did not have a driver’s license. The deputy also smelled marijuana.
