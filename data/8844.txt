Oregon State Police said a Roseburg officer tried to stop a 1997 Honda Civic for a traffic violation traveling northbound on Northeast Stephens Street near Northwest Garden Valley Boulevard about 10:45 p.m. Sunday. The car sped up and lost control after about a mile, crashing into another Roseburg officer's car that was traveling southbound with its emergency lights on.

The driver, identified by police as 31-year-old Nathan W. Lubken of Roseburg, was pronounced dead at Mercy Medical Center in Roseburg.

A passenger in the Honda, identified as 27-year-old Holly Cherie Sullivan of Eugene, was in serious condition at Legacy Emanuel Hospital in Portland as of about 4 p.m., according to hospital spokeswoman Amber Shoebridge.

Police said the officer in the crash received minor injuries and is in good condition at Mercy Medical Center.

The driver and the officer were wearing seat belts and but it is unclear if the passenger was, police said.
