A man was shot to death by Tucson police officers at a South Side home Sunday morning, an official said.

Officers went to the home in the 5100 block of South 17th Avenue at 6:20 a.m. in response to a 911 call about gunshots being fired in the area, said Officer Charles Rydzak, a department spokesman.

At the home, near West Irvington Road, officers saw 19-year-old Juan Buelna Jr. inside with a handgun, Rydzak said.

The two officers — two-year veteran Travis Eygabroad and six-year veteran Eric Evans — ordered him to drop the gun, but Buelna put the gun in his front waistband.

He was then ordered to get on the floor and to not touch the gun; instead, he pulled the gun out of his waistband and was, in turn, shot by the officers, police said.

Buelna was pronounced dead at the scene, Rydzak said.

It is unclear how many shots were fired, Rydzak said.

The officers were outside the home when they shot Buelna.

Officers found several other people inside the home; none of them was injured.

Neither officer was injured.

This was the second fatal shooting involving a Tucson police officer in less than two weeks.

On June 24, Paul J. Hoppler, 28, was shot and killed by an off-duty officer after pulling a pellet gun that resembled a pistol and pointing it at the officer. The officer had stopped to help what he thought was a motorist who had crashed his vehicle.
