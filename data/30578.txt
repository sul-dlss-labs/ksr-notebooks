It began around noon near the UMaine Presque Isle campus.

The Presque Isle Police Department tells us they responded to a report of a male individual with a handgun behind a building on Main Street.

The Maine Attorney Generalâ€™s Office confirmed the suspect was 53-year-old Shannon Wilcox of Presque Isle.

Officers say they witnessed the suspect fire rounds into the air and ground, refusing to drop the weapon or speak with police.

After about 50 minutes of negotiating, officials say the suspect actively threatened the officers on scene with the firearm.

He was shot and killed by a Deputy in response.

The case is currently under investigation.
