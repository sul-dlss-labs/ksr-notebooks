A man wanted for questioning in connection with a Samson shooting death was captured Sunday night and then died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office said.

“He was taken into custody an hour ago (about 5:30 p.m.) on Interstate 65 at Exit 168 and was transported to a hospital for treatment of a self-inflicted gunshot wound,” said Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office Captain George Beaudry. “The hospital has pronounced him dead.”

James Chadwick Green was pronounced dead at about 6:20 p.m., Beaudry told AL.com. Green is believed to be a former Samson police officer, Beaudry said.

Alabama law enforcement officers began searching for him after a Samson woman, Sarah Cooper, died from injuries sustained in a shooting.

Authorities received a call about the suspect vehicle, a red 2017 Toyota truck, on Interstate 85 southbound near Taylor Road and a deputy followed him; the vehicled did not pull over and a chase began.

The chase ended on Interstate 65 southbound at South Boulevard.

Samson is a city of just under 2,000 population in Geneva County, part of the Dothan metro area.
