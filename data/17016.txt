Authorities have released the name of the man who apparently killed himself in an Ozark townhouse Monday while police were trying to arrest him on suspicion of distributing child pornography.

Jacob Ciprian, 25, committed suicide while police came to his home to execute a federal arrest warrant, according to U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman Don Ledford.

Ciprian was indicted last week on a federal charge of receiving and distributing child porn, according to court documents that were unsealed on Tuesday.

Receiving and distributing child porn is a Class B felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine up to $250,000.

Ozark Police Chief Tim Clothier said police went to the residence on the 3200 block of North 21st Street at about 7 a.m. Monday to serve a federal arrest warrant when they ran into some issues.

Clothier said the suspect looked out the window and made eye contact with officers and then disappeared out of eyesight.

A short time later, the man's girlfriend came out of the apartment and told officers the man — later identified as Ciprian — had asked her to leave, Clothier said.

Police then heard a single gunshot so they evacuated nearby residences, according to Clothier.

Officers from multiple agencies were pulled in to assist, and police eventually entered the residence to find the suspect deceased of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Clothier.

The federal indictment does not provide many details about Ciprian's alleged crimes, only that the infractions were committed on or about July 22 in Christian County.

The indictment also contains a forfeiture allegation saying Ciprian would have to give up property used to commit the crimes, including two SD cards, a flash drive, a laptop computer and a desktop computer tower.
