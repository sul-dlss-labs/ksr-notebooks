Police in Northern California shot and killed a woman after she struck an officer with car, trapping him under a tire, authorities said Thursday.

Officers were called to the Discovery Village shopping center in Redding Wednesday evening, where a 62-year-old woman was yelling and cursing at patrons of a pizza parlor, a police statement said.

The woman finally left but continued to cause a disturbance in the parking lot for about 20 minutes before a security guard who had confronted her called police, the statement said.

Arriving officers found the woman in a car. In trying to leave, she nearly hit an officer, then backed up, hitting an officer with a front tire. He fell down and was pinned under the tire, police said.

To keep the car from moving, the other officer shot out a tire, then shot at the woman and fatally wounded her, police said.

She was from Yuba County but her name wasnâ€™t immediately released.

The officer who was struck by her car was treated at a hospital. He was released and is expected to make a full recovery, police said.
