The video shows the second suspect, 26-year-old Chauncey Reed (black shirt), retrieving a weapon from inside the vehicle and pointing it at the officer. The officer is also seen firing at the vehicle and shattering the driver's side window.

Police say Elliot Reed was hit multiple times and died at the hospital.

Chauncey Reed is charged with aggravated assault on a police officer and capital murder. Police say his actions during the incident led to the murder charge.

On Thursday, Chauncey Reed was mistakenly released from the Hinds County Detention Center. Hinds County Investigators, along with Jackson police and U.S. Marshals, were able to get him back in custody hours later and he was taken to the Madison County Detention Center.
