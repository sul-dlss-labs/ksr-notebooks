On August 27, 2015, the complainant Florence Garcia called the police and advised them that her boyfriend Silvestre Garcia (suspect) assaulted her by punching her repeatedly in the face. Florence Garcia also stated her boyfriend was destroying her residence, was now walking down the street completely naked and was high on cocaine.

Officers made contact with Silvestre Garcia down the street where he was found naked and appeared to be under the influence of something. The officers attempted to take him into custody by placing handcuffs on him and Silvestre Garcia put up some passive resistance. The Officers made the decision to not use their Tasers because of the report of the suspect being high on cocaine. After placing handcuffs on the suspect he appeared to become unresponsive. SAFD was requested and EMS transported the suspect to the hospital where he passed away 3 days later.
