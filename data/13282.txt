Jefferson City Police Chief Kenneth Davis and one of his detectives were identified as the officers involved in a shooting Monday that killed a knife-wielding suspect.

Davis and Detective Michael Stallings have been placed on administrative leave with pay, pending the outcome of state authorities’ investigation, according to a news release from the Jefferson City Police Department on Tuesday.

Tracy Lynn Daniel, 51, refused to drop his knife when confronted by officers who responded Monday morning to a report of a man threatening another with a knife at 1026 Martha Glass Drive, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

Officers at the scene attempted to subdue Daniel with a TASER, as well as multiple shots from a nonlethal bean-bag weapon, “which had no effect on the suspect,” the release states.

“The suspect then charged officers with the knife, leaving officers no choice but to discharge their weapons to stop his attack,” it reads.

Daniel’s body was taken to the Regional Forensic Center at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville. The results of the TBI probe will be forwarded to the district attorney general’s office for review.
