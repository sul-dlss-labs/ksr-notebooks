A man who shot three people outside a Roebuck methadone clinic before taking his own life has been identified as Darol Wayne Odell, said Jefferson County, Alabama, Chief Deputy Coroner Pat Curry.

Odell, 42, opened fire about 8:30 a.m. today outside the Tri County Treatment Center at 1101 East Park Drive off Gadsden Highway in what appeared to be a "love triangle" dispute, said Birmingham police spokesman Sgt. Johnny Williams Jr. Investigators said Odell was waiting at the clinic for his girlfriend and her new boyfriend to arrive. When they did, Odell fired at the girlfriend but instead struck three others, police said.

David Dewayne Martin, 44, of Fultondale, was pronounced dead on the scene from a gunshot wound to the chest. Two other people going into the clinic -- a man and a women -- were wounded by gunfire. The woman remained hospitalized this afternoon. The man was treated at the scene. The girlfriend was not injured.

After the shootings, Odell left the scene in a car where police began pursuing him along Alabama 79 just north of Tarrant, police said.

He refused to stop, and turned left onto Industrial Drive.

When he reached the intersection of Pine Hill Road and Tarrant Road, he shot himself in the head, authorities said. He then wrecked at 313 Springdale Road. He was pronounced dead on the scene.

Williams said investigators believe the shooting was the result of a domestic dispute.

A woman at the scene at did not see the shooting but said she arrived moments after it happened. "Thank God, I wasn't inside," said Diana Green.
