UNION COUNTY, NC (WBTV) - A man is dead and three officers are on administrative leave following a shooting Thursday evening.

Union County Chief Deputy Ben Bailey told WBTV that deputies received a call about a woman being assaulted at a home along the 3200-block of Wolf Pond Road around 8 p.m. Thursday evening.

After visiting the home, deputies returned three hours later to serve a warrant for an arrest of a man wanted in the incident. That man was later identified as 49-year-old Brent Taylor Catoe.

When deputies arrived, they went to a house next door, looking for Catoe.

That's when deputies say Catoe grabbed a pistol and ashotgun and ran into the woods. Three officers and a police dog went after him.

After tracking down Catoe in the woods, deputies say he pointed at least one of the guns at them.

Catoe reportedly refused to answer repeated calls to drop the weapon. WBTV has learned at least one deputy fired a shot, hitting Catoe.

Catoe was pronounced dead a short time later.

Deputies say the woman hurt in the alleged assault was treated by medics. She is expected to be okay.

Deputies say both Catoe and the woman lived inside the same home on Wolf Pond Road, but their relationship is unclear.

All three deputies involved in the incident are on administrative leave, which is standard procedure for an incident like this.

"Officers receive training. They have agency policy to guide them and they have state law behind them. In this particular case it appears preliminarily that they were consistent with all three," Deputy Chief Bailey said.
