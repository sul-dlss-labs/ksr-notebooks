MUSKOGEE, Oklahoma â€“ Charges will not be filed against a Muskogee Police officer involved in a fatal shooting earlier this month, the Muskogee County District Attorney's office said Thursday.

Officer Ginny Bemo shot and killed 38-year-old Letha Adams on October 1, 2010, after Adams got into a scuffle with Officer Perry Galvin and tried to take his gun.

Officer Galvin was responding to a domestic disturbance call after Adams and her mother got into an argument at a home in Muskogee.

The Muskogee County District Attorney said Adams "physically attacked" Officer Galvin when he tried to "remove her from the residence." The DA went on to say Officer Bemo shot Adams after she refused "to let go of Officer's Galvin's gun."

The D.A. described the officer's action as "reasonable under the circumstances, necessary to preserve human life and was justifiable."

The department says both officers will return to duty as soon as they complete their mandatory counseling.
