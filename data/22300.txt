HOBART | A Valparaiso man was killed in a Sunday night police chase while he fled from police.

Delbert Clem, 27, of 449 E. 300 N. was pronounced dead at 4:05 a.m. at St. Mary Medical Center in Hobart, according to the Lake County coroner's office. Clem died as a result of blunt force trauma to the body.

The accident occurred as a Lake Station police officer pursued Clem south on Ind. 51 through the Route 6 intersection at a high rate of speed about 11:22 p.m., Hobart Police Det. Jeff White said.

Clem apparently lost control of his vehicle, left the roadway and hit a curb, several signs and two poles, White said. The vehicle then flipped over and landed on its roof on top of several vehicles in the Paul Heuring Ford used car lot, White said.

Clem had to be extricated from his 2000 Dodge Stratus and was transported by Hobart ambulance to St. Mary Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead several hours later.

White said it was unclear how fast Clem was going when the accident was reported. It was unclear whether Clem was wearing a seatbelt.

No other injuries were reported.
