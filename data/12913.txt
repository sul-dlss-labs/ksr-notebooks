Overview

The officer shot Friday night on Tara Boulevard at Upper Riverdale Road has been released from the hospital, according to Clayton County police.

The shooting happened after a man and woman in separate cars were having an argument as they drove down the road around 10:15 p.m.

Clayton County Officer Melvin Snell was stopped at a traffic light when the car driven by the female struck his cruiser. Snell exited his patrol car to investigate. The female driver in the second car told Snell that she was being followed by the father of her children. At that moment, the woman's car was struck by the man she identified as the children's father.



The man pulled the gun and fired at Snell. At least one bullet hit Snell in the shoulder.

When the third driver got out of his vehicle, he began to attack the woman, according to police.

During the altercation, a second Clayton County officer had arrived on the scene. Snell separated himself from the gunman. At that point the second officer fatally shot the gunman, according to police.

The gunman's family told CBS Atlanta News their brother, 34-year-old Seon Rose, wasn't himself.

Rose's sister, Vanessa Stanford-Rose, said she wasn't sure what's more shocking, her brother's untimely death, or that the Army National Guard reservist would engage in a gun battle with police.

"Shocked, surprised, shocked - I didn't expect this," said Stanford-Rose. "If he was in his right frame of mind, I don't think he would have done that. And I'm deeply sorry to the family of the police officer."

She said her younger brother hasn't been himself for a few years now following a tour in Iraq. He certainly wasn't the brother she knew on Friday night.
