Oliver, 25, of the 700 block of East 69th Street, was pronounced dead at the scene about 11:30 a.m., according to the medical examiner's office.

Police spokeswoman Monique Bond said Oliver, an ex-boyfriend of the woman, had a conviction for a domestic battery.

Court records show Oliver was charged with domestic battery and aggravated assault with a weapon in January. He pleaded guilty in April and was sentenced to 120 days in Cook County Jail.

He also had domestic battery arrests in 2004, 2005 and 2006, according to court records.
