A Marysville man injured in a motorcycle accident in Arlington July 26 died at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle July 31.

Detectives want to speak with anyone who may have witnessed the accident or the chase from Marysville to Arlington that preceded it, a Washington State Patrol news release says.

Garrett Olson, 23, of Marysville died, but there was another motorcyclist involved in the chase who is still unknown.

The riders were traveling at speeds up to 100 mph on Interstate 5. Troopers in aircraft and on the ground were in pursuit.

The riders exited at Smokey Point and split up.

Troopers quit chasing Olson when he went through a red light. He crashed a short time later when he tried to pass vehicles on Highway 531 on the right where there was no shoulder.

Anyone with information is asked to call detective Charles Sletten at 360-654-1144.
