A 27-year veteran of the New Orleans Police Department has been booked with vehicular homicide after an investigation determined she was under the influence of alcohol when her car collided with another vehicle, killing the driver.

Sergeant Virginia Danton, who had been assigned to the Public Integrity Bureau, also faces charges of first-degree vehicular negligent injuring and vehicular injuring.

The accident happened July 6th. Three people were traveling on Earhart Expressway when the driver, who was speeding, lost control and hit a guardrail.

The vehicle came to a stop and was resting horizontally on the expressway when Danton ran into its side with her vehicle. Police say she was off-duty at the time.

The driver died a short time later and the two passengers were injured. After the crash, Danton was reassigned and placed on administrative duty.

The Fatality Unit later concluded that Danton's blood alcohol level was at the legal limit and she surrendered Wednesday. Danton was immediately suspended without pay.

Superintendent Eddie Compass says that even though Danton's blood alcohol level was not over the legal limit, it was still a serious offense.
