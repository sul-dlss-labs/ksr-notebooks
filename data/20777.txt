NORRISTOWN, Pa. (CBS) -- A former Pennsylvania state trooper who was off duty and drunk behind the wheel will spend at least six months behind bars in connection with a fiery fatal crash on the Pennsylvania Turnpike, near Plymouth Meeting, nearly two years ago.

Barry Searfoss has pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and DUI, and was sentenced to 6-23 months in prison. Prosecutors say the 42-year-old Coatesville man had a blood-alcohol level more than twice the legal limit when he collided with a car driven by 21-year-old Robin Williams. The car exploded and she was killed.

Defense attorney Christian Hoey says he and his client are pleased with the outcome of today's proceedings.

"It doesn't mitigate, of course, the loss the Williams family sustained," he said afterward. "We're very saddened by that loss. But in the courtroom, I think we all got it correct, and I think we got the best result possible for everybody involved."

Prosecutors say there were challenges because the car suffered a catastrophic engine failure causing it to slow down, and there was a faulty gas tank.

Police say Searfoss had been drinking beer for several hours at a charity golf outing designed to raise money for a scholarship named for a woman killed by a drunk driver.
