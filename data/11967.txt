NEW ORLEANS, LA (WWL-TV) - A chase in which a New Orleans Police officer Tazed a man, leading to a standoff with the man inside a Mid-City house, ended with the man's suicide early Sunday, police said.



The man's name was not released but police said he was 27 years old.



The incident began before 1 a.m. Sunday, when an officer on patrol pulled over the man, who was driving at a high rate of speed on Banks St., according to Officer Garry Flot, a police spokesman.



The driver turned onto the 400 block of S. Genois and stopped in a driveway. During questioning by the officer, the man allegedly pushed the officer and fled on foot.



After the officer caught up with the man, a struggle followed. The officer activated his Tazer on the man, who continued to resist and eventually got away, police said. He ran to the rear of a house in the block, where he apparently lived, knocking on the door before breaking glass and entering the house.



A man identified as the suspect's roommate came outside of the house and tried to talk the man out of the house, police said. He also told police that there were several guns and ammunition inside.



The SWAT team was called and a short time later police said they heard one gunshot. Later, the man was found inside with a gunshot wound to the head. He was pronounced dead on the scene, Flot said.



The officer involved in the struggle and initial chase suffered minor injuries, Flot said.
