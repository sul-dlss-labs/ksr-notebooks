SPARTA, N.C. — A man wielding a machete was killed after he walked into a North Carolina sheriff’s office overnight and allegedly charged at a deputy.

Authorities said a deputy with the Alleghany County Sheriff’s Office received a call from the communications office about a person in the lobby requesting to speak with an officer.

The deputy found 39-year-old Chad Eric Montgomery waiting in the lobby.

Deputies said Montgomery immediately pulled a large, machete-style weapon and charged at the deputy.

After ignoring verbal commands to drop the weapon, the deputy opened fire.

“It was very traumatic. It was very traumatic for everyone involved,” Sheriff Bryan Maines said.

The deputy involved was not harmed and is on administrative leave.

The incident was captured on the deputy’s body camera and the sheriff’s office’s security cameras.

The State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the case, which is standard procedure.
