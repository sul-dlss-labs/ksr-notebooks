Phoenix police have identified a 44-year-old man killed in an officer-involved shooting Tuesday as Jose Aaron Gonzalez.

According to police, at 6:30 a.m. officers were called to a home near 31st Avenue and Roosevelt Street to serve a search warrant for the Arizona Department of Transportation regarding an investigation into identity theft and forgery.

Officers reportedly made contact with a woman and three children inside the home, who exited the residence without incident.

Police say they then saw Gonzalez flee down the hallway where he hid in a back room, where he stayed inside a closet armed with a handgun.

As officers were still outside the home, Gonzalez reportedly left his hiding location and confronted officers, pointing a gun at them from the hallway.

Police say three officers then shot Gonzalez, ending the threat. He was pronounced dead at the scene

No additional suspects were located.

Police say they will be conducting standard criminal and internal inquiries into the shooting and ADOT will be continuing their investigation as well.
