Kids Come First Daycare and Preschool returned to its original building at 900 E. First St. on Aug 5 following seven weeks of renovation and reconstruction after a ceiling fire on June 14.

Shandi Swaim said the fire was started by a power surge from outside the building.

“The fire was contained in the ceiling,” Swaim said, “but the inside of the building had to be gutted due to the smoke damage.”

Renovation began June 17, the Monday following the Friday fire. During the renovation Kids Come First temporarily moved into Washington Elementary School.

Swain said Kids Come First was not closed a single operating day during the original building’s renovation.

Swaim is gracious to the parents and others that have supported Kids Come First through the last two troubled months.

“The parents are very appreciative that we’ve kept the doors open, and Associate Superintendent Chris Ruder was super to work with during our time at Washington Elementary,” Swaim said. “In fact, we haven’t lost any kids, we’ve actually gained kids.”

MaDonna Dammann, lead teacher for 3-to-4-year-olds and a parent to two children attending Kids Come First, said she’s relieved to finally be back on track in their own building.

“It’s nice being back to normal,” Dammann said.
