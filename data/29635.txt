A suspect was killed after a shootout with Seattle police near the Northwest African American Museum in the Central District Tuesday night. One victim shot by the suspect died on her way to the hospital. The second shooting victim is expected to survive her injuries.

On Wednesday night, police released footage of the shooting from private surveillance cameras and police body cameras.

Assistant Police Chief Deanna Nollette said officers responded to reports of a shooting near 24th Avenue South and South Massachusetts Street just after 9:15 p.m. Tuesday.

When officers arrived on the scene, they heard multiple shots being fired. Nollette said a suspect came around the corner of the parking lot of the museum, raised his firearm and started shooting at the responding officers.

Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. First responders gave the suspect medical aid, but he was pronounced dead at the scene.

Nollette said two shooting victims were found in a vehicle in a parking lot of 2300 South Massachusetts Street. Both victims were taken to Harborview Medical Center with life-threatening injuries.

Seattle police said one victim died on the way to the hospital. The second victim was in satisfactory condition early Wednesday morning.

Police believe the suspect knew the victims. Information was not immediately available about what led to the incident.

Nollette said the investigation into the incident would be conducted by the Seattle Police Department's Force Investigation Unit with oversight from the Office of Professional Accountability and the Office of the Inspector General and possibly reviewed by the King County Sheriff's Office.
