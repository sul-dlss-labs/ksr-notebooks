Two police officers in Irving are on administrative leave after shooting and killing a man in a hotel parking lot Sunday evening after he tried to flee, authorities said.

The man was identified Monday as Ashif Anwar, 38, a Bangladeshi national. He died of a single gunshot wound, police said an autopsy showed, and his immigration status was not immediately known.

Irving police officials said the shooting happened at The Crossroads Hotel and Suites at 3135 E. John Carpenter Freeway at about 6:30 p.m.

Police said an officer initially noticed the car linked to a man wanted on several felony warrants at about 1 p.m. Because of the man's history, the officers called in a SWAT team and began working on a plan to arrest him, according to Irving Police Department spokesman James McLellan.

"We needed to do this methodically and carefully, so there was no danger to anyone else," McLellan said. "But unfortunately, while they were formulating the plan to arrest him, that kind of escalated the situation."

Sometime after 6 p.m., police said the man left the hotel, entered the vehicle and tried to maneuver it around a SWAT vehicle. The SWAT vehicle and another vehicle were hit.

"The suspect attempted to flee, putting the officers in danger, and they were forced to fire upon the suspect, which killed him at the scene," said McLellan.

McLellan said the officers feared for their safety.

"I just saw them pointing the guns at whoever was over there, and then I was just scared," Evelyn Rivera said. "I didn't want to get shot."

The man's warrants were for identity theft, evading arrest with a vehicle, possession of a firearm by felon and â€Žmanufacturing or delivery of a controlled substance, according to police.
