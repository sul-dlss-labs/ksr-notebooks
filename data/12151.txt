OAKLAND — A woman who was killed when a man fleeing police caused a two-car crash last week has been identified, police said Thursday.

Brianna Elaine Carmina Ford, 21, of Georgia was a passenger in a 2001 Lincoln Continental that was hit by a BMW driven by Saint Dewan Moore, 34, of Oakland, police said.

California Highway Patrol officers tried to stop Moore’s 2007 BMW at the intersection of 90th and Bancroft avenues last Thursday night. He pulled the car over about 11:20 p.m., but as officers got out and walked toward the BMW, the car sped away, according to the CHP.

The BMW made a U-turn, drove up 90th Avenue onto MacArthur Boulevard, then turned onto 98th Avenue where it struck the Lincoln between Stanley Avenue and Golf Links Road, police said.

The woman was killed and four other passengers in the Lincoln were taken to hospitals with moderate to major injures, police said. Police said Moore ran away but was caught not far from the crash scene and arrested on suspicion of evading arrest and vehicular manslaughter.

Anyone with information about the crash is asked to contact CHP at 510-286-6923.
