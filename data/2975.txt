A Chicago police officer working off-duty at a McDonald's in the Hyde Park neighborhood shot and killed an unarmed 21-year-old man Tuesday night after a confrontation outside the restaurant, authorities said.

Steven Curry, 21, was killed by a single gunshot wound to the chest after he and three others allegedly threatened and confronted an off-duty officer at the McDonald's at 1344 E. 53rd St. Tuesday night.

The police officer, whose name was not released, was confronted by three patrons causing a disturbance at the restaurant about 8 p.m. Tuesday, police said. The three threatened the officer as he escorted them from the restaurant, police spokesman Sgt. Edward Alonzo said Wednesday.

The three returned to the restaurant with another person about 10:30 p.m., police said. A scuffle started between the officer and the group outside the restaurant, authorities said.

During the confrontation, police said, Curry grabbed at his waistband. Alonzo said the officer feared for his life and fired several shots at Curry, hitting him once in the chest.

Curry, whose address is unknown, was pronounced dead by the Cook County medical examiner's office at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday. Alonzo said that no weapon was found on Curry.

The officer was not injured, police said.

Alonzo said Wednesday that the officer's use of deadly force seemed to be in compliance with department guidelines. The department's Office of Professional Standards is investigating the shooting.

Two of those involved--Dion C. Bufkin, 26, of the 900 block of East 52nd Street, and a 16-year-old boy--were charged Wednesday with aggravated battery of a police officer, authorities said.
