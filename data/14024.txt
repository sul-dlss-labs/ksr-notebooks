LOUISVILLE, KY (WAVE) - We are getting new details about the man who died after leading police on a chase through two counties.

On February 1, a chase through Mount Washington ended in Jefferson County at Bardstown Road and Waterford when the driver crashed into some trees. The man that led the chase was Jeffrey Lykins, 47, a teacher for the Jefferson County Public Schools who taught at Rangeland Elementary.

According to the Mt. Washington Police report, Officer Charles Ballard, the officer who followed Lykins, said someone initially called him in panic around 5:50 p.m. The caller told Ballard they were behind a Buick that veered off the side of the road a couple of times and hit some objects at Kings Church Road and Highway 44 East. Ballard told the caller to call 911 and he would meet up with them.

At a stoplight in front of Kroger on the Bardstown Road bypass Ballard noticed the Buick had a severely cracked windshield. When the light turned green, Ballard noticed Lykins was heading for the median. When he flipped on his emergency lights, Ballard said Lykins fled down Bardstown Road.

The report says Lykins was weaving into other lanes, going through medians and in to opposing traffic. Lykins went up an embankment and crashed into cedar trees before crashing to his death.

The toxicology reports have not come back yet. The case has been turned over to Louisville Metro Police
