PHOENIX — A man identified as a suspect in a fatal shooting outside a Wal-Mart in eastern Arizona killed himself after being pulled over by an officer, New Mexico State Police said Wednesday.

Donald Belanger, 55, of Heber, killed himself Tuesday after being stopped by a state police sergeant who saw him driving 45 mph on Interstate 25 near Isleta south of Albuquerque, police spokesman Peter Olson said.

The sergeant was nearly stopped behind Belanger’s car when he saw the man raise his arm to his head with something in his hand, Olson said. The officer saw a flash and a puff of smoke, and once he got to the car, he found Heber had shot himself, he said.

The man had no pulse by the time the sergeant got to him, Olson said.

Two handguns and what Olson described as “some sort of suicide note” were inside the vehicle.

Olson said he did not know what the note said, and did not know the caliber of the guns.

New Mexico authorities discovered later in the day that Belanger was wanted in Arizona, he said.

Belanger was suspected in a shooting Monday outside a Wal-Mart in Show Low that left an elderly woman dead and her husband critically wounded. Police say the husband was recovering at a Phoenix-area hospital.
