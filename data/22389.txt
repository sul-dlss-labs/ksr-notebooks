The investigation into the shooting deaths of Officer Ryan E. Cappelletty and Francho S. Bradley reiterates that Officer Steve A. Bracciodieta was justified in shooting Bradley and his actions on May 28 were necessary and appropriate, according to a release issued this evening by the Chesterfield Police Department.

This comes upon the completion of a three-month internal investigation into the incident. Physical evidence and witness statements support that Bradley shot and fatally wounded Officer Cappelletty on May 28. That same evidence clearly exhibits that Officer Steve A. Bracciodieta acted in accordance with all of the departments training guidelines, policies and procedures. The investigation further indicated that both Cappelletty and Bracciodietas lives were in immediate danger. The Office of the Commonwealths Attorney concurs with these findings, according to the statement.
