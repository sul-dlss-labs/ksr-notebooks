The man shot by police in Rosebud earlier this year died from a gunshot wound and neck injury, according to his death certificate.

Jacob Archambault, a 25-year-old from St. Francis, died Jan. 27 from a gunshot wound to the chest, orthopedic decapitation and a car crash, according to the death certificate. An orthopedic decapitation occurs when the skull separates from the spinal column.

While it was clear that the Rosebud Sioux Tribe Law Enforcement Services shot at Archambault, it wasn't initially clear whether he was hit or how he died until the Journal obtained his death certificate.

Soon after the shooting, FBI spokesman Kevin Smith said Archambault "died as the result of a tribal officer-involved shooting." RST Police Chief Marlin Enno said it was unclear if the man was hit, and, if so, if he died from the shooting or the impact of the car crash.

Archambault died around 7:08 p.m. inside his car on Spotted Tail Lane in Rosebud, the certificate says. His manner of death was ruled a homicide — meaning he was killed by another person — and he was injured due to the police pursuit and gunfire, the documents says. Not all homicides — such as certain accidents and self-defense killings — are criminal.
