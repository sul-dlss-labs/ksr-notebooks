A Tulsa police officer shot and killed a naked man who reportedly pointed a gun at him Monday afternoon.

The fatal shooting occurred while police were responding to a report of a disturbance with a weapon in the 1100 block of South Wheeling Avenue about 3:45 p.m., Capt. Mike Williams said.

The identities of the individuals involved have not been released, but the officer who fired the shots has been placed on routine administrative leave while detectives investigate the shooting. The names of officers involved in shootings typically are released by the Tulsa Police Department within a few days of the incident.

Monday’s events began when a neighbor called police to say the man pointed a gun at him, Williams said. The neighbor reported that the man has caused several disturbances in the past.

When the officer arrived in the neighborhood, he was confronted by the naked man, who either ran out of a home or appeared from between two homes, carrying a gun.

Williams said the man was given several commands to put the gun down, but he “continued to aggress” the officer, who fired multiple shots. The man was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The encounter lasted “a matter of seconds,” the captain said.

Detectives did not yet know whether the man had a mental issue or was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Police closed off the street for several hours as they investigated the shooting and began attempting to locate the deceased man’s next of kin. Blood could be seen on the street at the location.

Williams said the incident occurring on Christmas did not impede the police department’s response time to the shooting.

With six days left in the year as of Tuesday, the shooting is the city’s 81st homicide of 2017. It’s one short of tying the all-time record for a year, set last year.
