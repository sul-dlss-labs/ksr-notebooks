A four-year-old Luling girl died Friday, six days after being struck by a stolen car fleeing police. Kylin woods died Friday afternoon at the Medical Center of Louisiana in New Orleans.

An arrest warrant has been issued for 17-year-old Matthew Barra, the young man allegedly driving the stolen car that hit Kylin. Police said officers saw someone in a stolen red Chevrolet Camaro, spinning its tires and driving erratically last Saturday. Before they could react, the car sped away and hit Kylin, who was in the street.

The warrant sworn out Wednesday accuses Barra of felony hit and run, reckless driving and negligent injury. Police said they also planned to file a charge of possessing stolen property.
