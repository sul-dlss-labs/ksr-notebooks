The chase began in Detroit, when 42-year-old Brian Keith Boling sped away during a traffic stop.

Police believe Boling -- who had warrants out for driving with a suspended licence, indecent exposure and three drunk driving charges -- may have been drinking and reached speeds of around 50 mph during the chase.

Warren police joined the pursuit when Boling crossed into the suburb, following him down the dead end where he eventually collided with the cyclone fence.

Boling died on the spot and a toxicology report is pending.

"The odds of this happening is probably a billion to one," Dwyer said. "Certainly it wasn't worth his life to flee from police."
