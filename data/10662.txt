A man who died in police custody choked to death on a "foreign body" after a drug arrest in the East Garfield Park neigborhood Wednesday, the Cook County medical examiner's office found following an autopsy today.

Kevin Davis, 47, had been arrested in the 500 block of North St. Louis Avenue about 7:40 p.m. Wednesday on a drug charge.

At some point, Davis tried to swallow a packet of drugs and started to choke on them, police said. An ambulance was called and Davis, whose last known address was on South Grant Avenue in North Aurora, was taken to Saints Mary and Elizabeth Medical Center, police said. Davis was pronounced dead at the hospital at 8:28 p.m., according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

The medical examiner's office ruled Davis's death an accident, determining following an autopsy that he had suffered asphyxia after choking on a "foreign body," according to a summary of the medical examiner's findings.

Davis has a long list of arrests dating back to the early 1990s and several felony convictions for dealing drugs and armed robbery, according to court records.

On Tuesday, the Tribune published an article by reporter Steve Mills detailing how deaths in police custody can often lead to civil lawsuits and expensive court settlements. Attorneys representing the families of those who've died in police custody complained that officers didn't act quickly enough in seeking medical attention for their loved ones.
