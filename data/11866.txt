HAYWARD — Authorities have released the identity of a man who police say fatally shot himself in the head Monday while running from police.

Eric Mandell, 45, of unincorporated Hayward, died at a hospital Monday night after the shooting in the 2200 block of Montgomery Street, an Alameda County Coroner’s Office spokeswoman said Thursday.

Officers responded to Montgomery Street and Sunset Boulevard after reports of shots fired just before 4 p.m., Lt. Roger Keener said.

A preliminary investigation revealed an officer tried to contact Mandell, who instead ran away.

Mandell ran down Montgomery Street toward Simon Boulevard before rounding a turn and going out of officers’ sight, Keener said. At that point, police say Mandell pulled out a gun and shot himself in the head, he said.

As of Thursday the incident remained under investigation and authorities had not released a motive for the shooting.
