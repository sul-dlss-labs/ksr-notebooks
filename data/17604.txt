Sheriff's Sgt. Spencer Cannon said that just before noon, the deputy had been looking for 33-year-old Mark Daniel Bess  who was wanted on drug-related felony and misdemeanor warrants and a traffic-related warrant  when he learned Bess had been spotted near 4500 South and 3200 West, where he had recently lived.
