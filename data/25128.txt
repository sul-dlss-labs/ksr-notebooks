ORIGINAL STORY

Police in a Salt Lake City suburb say an officer has died after being intentionally struck by a car driven by a fleeing burglary suspect.

Authorities say the driver was shot by police and died, and an accomplice was arrested.

South Salt Lake Police Chief Jack Carruth says officer David Romrell died Saturday night. The 31-year-old Marine Corps veteran is survived by his wife and 4-month-old child.

Carruth says Romrell and another officer responded to a burglary call at a business and came across two men trying to flee.

The officers got out of their patrol vehicles and ordered the men to stop. Instead, police say the driver accelerated and struck Romrell.

Officers fired at the fleeting vehicle and fatally struck the driver.
