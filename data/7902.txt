SAN BERNARDINO – A man who stripped off his clothes and got into a fight with several San Bernardino police officers at Seccombe Lake Park died while in custody due to an enlarged heart and obesity, prosecutors said Tuesday.

Prosecutors cleared the officers of criminal charges in the March incident, saying the amount of force they used to arrest 22-year-old Terry Wayne Jackson was justified.

Jackson, who was under the influence of methamphetamine and marijuana, asked officers if they could `see the dragons’ before he was taken into custody. Police had to use a Taser gun on him several times before they got him handcuffed.

Police initially came to the park near the corner of Fifth Street and Sierra Way at 1:15 p.m. on a report of a man who appeared to be exposing himself to people in the park.

An officer said the man was walking around the park with a wide-eyed stare and was sweating profusely. He climbed over a railing and walked into the lake when more officers arrived.

“The subject was incoherent and kept repeating the same phrase, `The dragons, the dragons,’ the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office wrote in a report.

Prosecutors said the man bit an officer, and kicked, head-butted and struggled with police while being taken into custody. While sitting in the back of a patrol car, officers discovered the man had no pulse and called for paramedics.

Jackson’s mother told police her son had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic several years ago and was taking medication to control his mental illness.

“If he did not take his medication, he would start talking to aliens and become schizophrenic,” prosecutors wrote in the report.
