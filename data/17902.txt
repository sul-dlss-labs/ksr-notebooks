A man crashed a pickup truck, cut his wrists, threatened deputies with a knife and yelled "shoot me" before he was killed by law enforcement last year in Cordova, according to a letter clearing the officers.

Two Shelby County Sheriff's deputies won't be charged in the shooting of 46-year-old Edmond Otis Studdard, who was shot in July 2016 and later died, according to the office of the Shelby County District Attorney General. The redacted Tennessee Bureau of Investigation file on the shooting was posted online Monday.

Law enforcement was called around 1 p.m. July 7, 2016 to the 1100 block of Big Orange Cove. Studdard began acting erratically at work and got into an argument with his father at the business, A & H Iron Works. Studdard got into a pickup truck and drove around in fast circles, before crashing into his father's Corvette, according to the file.

Studdard then went into a bathroom at the business, cut his wrists, walked into the woods and then began walking north on Big Orange Cove.

Deputies arrived to the scene where Studdard refused to drop the knife and yelled "Shoot me. Shoot me," according to the file.

A deputy said she fired at him when Studdard was about 7-to-10 feet away because "he was coming at me with a weapon."

Another deputy also said he fired from about 7 to 10 feet away when he "felt myself and my partners were in fear of our life."

Studdard was struck in the neck and right arm and died of complications from the gunshot wounds in September.
