Two Shakopee police officers shot and killed a man after an alleged stabbing and carjacking this morning.

The two officers were responding to reports of a stabbing at 8:15 a.m. when their squad car was rammed by another vehicle. Police say that car was being driven by the suspect in the stabbing.

Officers pursued the 34-year-old man, and caught him on the northbound ramp from state Highway 169 onto Marschall Road. Police say they shot and killed the man. A portion of Highway 169 was closed for two hours this morning.

The stabbing victim was a 30-year-old Shakopee woman who was taken to St. Francis Regional Medical Center with critical injuries. She has since died.

Police say the man who was killed is also a suspect in a burglary that took place in Shakopee yesterday, and in a carjacking in Plymouth this morning.

Officers involved in the shooting have been placed on standard administrative leave. The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension is investigating.
