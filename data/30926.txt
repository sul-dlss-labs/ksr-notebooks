Federal agents said Thomas was wanted for an armed robbery in Danville, Virginia, when U.S. marshals and other members of the Northern Ohio Violent Task Force surrounded a house in the 1700 block of Regent Avenue NE, where he was staying.

The agents were there to serve an arrest warrant.

U.S. Marshal Peter J. Elliott said on March 24 that when officers arrived, Thomas yelled that he wanted to be killed by police and came outside firing. Thomas and one of the U.S. marshals exchanged shots and both were injured.
