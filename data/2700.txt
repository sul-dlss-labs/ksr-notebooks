AKRON, Ohio (AP) - A 16-year-old Akron-area boy who killed a woman in a car crash will be jailed for at least a year and possibly until he's 21.

Anthony Brennan, of Stow, was sentenced on Wednesday in Summit County Juvenile Court after accepting charges of aggravated vehicular homicide and aggravated vehicular assault.

Juvenile Court Judge Linda Tucci Teodosio told Brennan he won't be allowed to get his driver's license until he reaches 21 and he has to write a paper about his role in the crash.

The paper is due June 21, which would have been the 22nd birthday of his victim, Melissa "Missy" Sadlowski, of Stow.

On Aug. 8, Brennan crashed into Sadlowski's car while fleeing police with his headlights turned off.

The crash devastated the Stow community, as was evident by the crowd of people packed into the courtroom.

Family members of both Sadlowski and Brennan, and the judge, all attend the same church in Stow.
