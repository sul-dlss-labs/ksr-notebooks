RADCLIFF, KY (WAVE) â€“ A confrontation quickly escalated when police in Radcliff went to a man's apartment to question him about a burglary in the area.

It happened at the Foxwood Apartments off of Seminole Road and North Woodland Drive around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday.

The suspect wasn't happy to see officers.



"He told them he didn't want to talk to them and that he didn't want them in his residence. Our officers told him we are officially asking you to come to the police department with us and make a statement," said Bryce Shumate with the Radcliff Police Department.



After the man had calmed down he agreed to go with the officers, or so it seemed.



"He said okay I need to come in and get my shoes on. As officers followed him back to his bedroom to get shoes, he was able to get a pistol. When he got that pistol, he fired rounds at our officers. Our officers returned fire," Shumate said.



The suspect died at the scene. Radcliff Sgt. Jeremy Davis was nearly hurt in the exchange of gunfire.



"A round struck his ankle. Thank goodness it didn't penetrate the boot," Shumate said. The officer wasn't hurt.



Neighboring apartments were evacuated, with residents taken somewhere warm to avoid the freezing temperatures that moved in Wednesday evening.

The suspects name wasn't immediately available, as the Coroner's Office worked to make sure his family has all been notified.

Thursday afternoon, the Coroner identified the suspect as Michael Strand, 47, of Radcliff. Despite his alleged involvement in a shoot-out with police, detectives say he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.



Strand's criminal history in Kentucky contained a DUI.
