Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 11200 Fondren

May 21, 2012 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed suspect by an HPD officer at 11200 Fondren about 12:45 p.m. last Friday (May 18).



The suspect, Jason Aaron Pierce (b/m, DOB: 7-3-87), of Houston, was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.



Sergeant K. Johnson, who discharged his duty weapon, was not injured in this incident. Sergeant Johnson was sworn in as an officer in May 1984 and is assigned to the South Gessner Patrol Division.



HPD Homicide Division Sergeants A. Carrillo and C. Howard reported:



Pierce was riding a Metro bus when he became involved in a confrontation with another male passenger and pulled a knife and threatened that passenger. The bus driver then stopped at 11200 Fondren and everyone exited the bus except the suspect and the other male passenger. Pierce then held the male at knife point while HPD and Metro officers arrived and set up a perimeter around the outside of the bus. Officers attempted to communicate with the suspect and gave him multiple verbal commands for him to drop the knife, which he ignored and became increasingly agitated with. When officers observed Pierce attempt to stab the other passenger, Sergeant Johnson boarded the bus and, in fear of his safety and for the safety of the other male passenger, discharged his duty weapon. Pierce was wounded and was transported to the hospital.



As is customary in HPD officer-involved shooting incidents in the city limits, this case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District District Attorney's Office.
