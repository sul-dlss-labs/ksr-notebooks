The results of toxicology tests may explain the death of a 33-year-old man in a police holding cell on the Northwest Side after an autopsy was inconclusive, a spokeswoman with the Cook County medical examiner's office said Thursday.

Joseph Yetter, of the 7500 block of Halesia Court in Orland Park, was found unresponsive just before 10 p.m. Wednesday in a holding cell at the Shakespeare District station, 2150 N. California Ave., according to police spokesman Officer Matthew Jackson.

Yetter had been cited for driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs and with leaving the scene of an accident after hitting eight parked cars, Jackson said.

He was taken to St. Elizabeth's Hospital, where he admitted using alcohol and cocaine. He was treated and then hospital officials told police he could be taken to the lockup, Jackson said.

Shortly after arrival at the Shakespeare station, the lockup keeper found Yetter unresponsive in a holding cell. He was pronounced dead at 12:23 a.m. Thursday, said the medical examiner's spokeswoman.

The results of toxicology tests may take a few weeks, she said.

A police spokeswoman said the incident is under investigation.
