A proposed merger of the Missouri State Water Patrol into the Missouri State Highway Patrol needs two key actions before it would become official.

The plan to merge the departments has been added to the omnibus Senate Bill 887 sponsored by Sen. Kurt Schaefer (R-Columbia).

Schaefer initially sponsored a simple bill crafted to ban synthetic forms of marijuana. Through the process of Senate and House committee approval, the bill has ballooned.

SB 887

-merges the Water Patrol with the Highway Patrol

-increases the dollar amount of assessed valuation a county must maintain in order to move up in classification

-allows any county to set a curfew for children under the age of 17

-allows counties to seek voter approval for taxes to be extended beyond their initial term

-allows the Department of Economic Development to offer 10-year tax credits to developers who build in designated enhanced enterprise zones

-allows ambulance districts to impose a sales tax, with voter approval, in lieu of a property tax

-classifies certain forms of cannibis (K2 or “spice”) as marijuana

-allows the Department of Natural Resources to establish minimum requirements for material recovery facilities

-creates the crime of endangering emergency personnel or emergency responders for traffic violations in emergency zones

-allows pharmacies to keep electronic records

-prohibits children under the age of 18 from riding on machinery or heavy equipment not designed for passengers (certain exceptions for farm machinery are included)

The House Public Safety Committee substitute for the omnibus bill requires a third and final vote in the House.

The bill would then require a conference, where members of the House and Senate committees that approved the bill would iron out and approve any changes before the bill would go up for final passage in the Senate.

The Missouri State Water Patrol notified 10 civilian employees that their jobs would be cut as of June 15. The Water Patrol will keep one civilian employee to handle buoy permit and regatta permit requests.
