GRANITE BAY (CBS13) -- One man is dead after a Placer County Sheriff's deputy opened fire at the man outside of a drug store in Granite Bay.

There are still plenty of unanswered questions. But we know the deputy stopped for a bottle of water at the am/pm at Douglas Boulevard and Sierra College Drive at about 10:30 Monday night. The deputy says he heard loud music coming from a car parked behind the Walgreens next door.

Deputies say the store was closed, but employees were still inside.

The deputy thought the circumstances were suspicious and decided to check it out. Investigators say that as the deputy made contact with the man, Robert Sean Clifford, 33, inside the car, he noticed a gun sitting within Clifford's reach on the passenger side.

The deputy called for backup, and as he waited for more officers to arrive, Clifford allegedly reached for his weapon, forcing the deputy to shoot, hitting him multiple times.

CPR was performed on Clifford and he was taken to the Sutter Roseville Medical Center where he later died.

The big question for detectives: what was Clifford doing in the parking lot, and why he have a gun?

The deputy is a 16-year veteran and is now on paid administrative leave, which is standard in these types of situations.
