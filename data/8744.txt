Man fatally shot by police in Calumet City

Authorities in the southern Chicago suburb of Calumet City say a 32-year-old Chicago man was shot and killed by a police officer during an altercation outside the Thornton Fractional High School District Board of Education office.

Calumet City Police Chief Ed Gilmore says two officers were hospitalized from injuries they suffered when allegedly attacked by the man identified as Prince Alima Bantu Akbar.

Gilmore said a male and female officer went to the board of education building in response to 911 calls about a disturbance there. They encountered Akbar, who reportedly attacked them without apparent cause. An effort to subdue Akbar with a Tazer failed, and he knocked both officers to the ground before the male officer managed to shoot him two times.
