A young Houston-area girl and her boyfriend are dead after the pair attempted to run away together in a stolen vehicle.

Last week, 14-year-olds Skyla Nuncio and Justin Henry died after the vehicle they were in crashed as they attempted to flee police.

Nuncio’s mother, Monica Vickous, said she received a call on January 10, informing her that her daughter’s boyfriend, Henry, had been suspended from school. Henry was known to be a troubled boy, but Vickous said she was unable to keep her daughter away from him.

‘She wanted him to feel loved,’ Vickous told KHOU11, ‘And she gave every ounce of love that she had to that young boy.”

Just 15 minutes after receiving the call about Henry, Vickous received another call, this time from her mother who said Nuncio had not gotten off the bus.

Nuncio and Henry were labeled as runaways and police began the search for the missing teens.

On Monday, January 14, a car reported stolen was spotted going the wrong way on a one-way street. Officers were able to identify the driver as Henry and his passenger as Nuncio. At first, a police officer gave chase onto Highway 225, but worried for the children’s safety as the Impala they were driving began swerving while going a high rate of speed. The officer, who can be heard on a recording of the incident, backed off but continued to follow the teens.

As they exited the highway, however, they struck the barrier of an off ramp. Nuncio was ejected from the vehicle. Both she and Henry were pronounced dead at the scene – neither was wearing a seat belt.

Nuncio was 9th grader at Cy-Fair High School, while Henry was in 8th grade at Campbell Middle School
