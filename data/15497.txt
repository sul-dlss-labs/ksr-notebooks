A toddler in the car at the time of the pursuit and crash was listed in critical but stable condition Sunday night at Children’s Hospital in Birmingham, Thornton added. Another occupant of the vehicle, an adult man, received serious but injuries that were not considered life-threatening, he said.

The incident began in the 2700 block of Zelda Road on Dec. 16 when officers responded to a shots-fired call, said Sgt. Denise Barnes, spokeswoman for the MPD. Officers pursued two suspected vehicles, the Ford and a pickup. The Ford collided with an Infiniti vehicle in the 2100 block of Woodley Road.

ALEA is investigating the crash, and MPD is investigating the shooting, Thornton said. No one was injured in the shooting.
