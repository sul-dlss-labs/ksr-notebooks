KNOXVILLE (AP) — Police shot and killed an armed man after they stopped the car he was driving for having a vehicle registration sticker on the wrong license plate, police said Friday.

A Knoxville police officer tried to stop the car about 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, but a chase began when the driver did not pull over, police Chief Dan Losada said.

He said the chase ended about 3 miles later when the car, which is registered to someone else, had a flat tire. The officer approached the car and ordered the driver to get out. The officer saw the man turn in his seat and point a revolver at him, Losada said.

The officer fired his own gun as the man got out of the car and ran off, Losada said.

Two Marion County sheriff’s deputies joined in the foot case, which ended when a police officer and a deputy confronted the man in a yard of a local residence. The man refused to drop his gun and the officers opened fire, striking the man once, Losada said.

The man was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Police identified the man as Frederick Dean Wright, 51, of Des Moines.

Losada said officers also found an explosive device the car and evacuated residents within a one-block radius of the car. Bomb technicians from the state fire marshal’s office were called in and defused the device.

Residents were allowed to return to their homes about 11 p.m.

Losada did not give further details about the device.

A check of Wright’s gun showed that one round had been fired and that he tried to fire five other rounds but the gun failed.

Two police officers and the sheriff’s deputy have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
