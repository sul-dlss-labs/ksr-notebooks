The suspect in Saturday’s officer-involved shooting near Eustis died Monday at Orlando Regional Medical Center, according to a Lake County Sheriff’s Office official.

Pamela Edwards, 40, was driving a Ford Mustang just before 12:30 p.m. Saturday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. The Eustis woman was heading east on Orange Avenue when she made a left onto County Road 44 Bypass while speeding.

The Mustang lost control and struck the front of a van that was stopped at the intersection, then struck it again as the Mustang accelerated and spun out of control, Sgt. Kim Montes said in a release.

Edwards fled north on County Road 44 Bypass to her home at the 2300 block of Grant Avenue, Montes said, but a witness followed and watched her step out of the car and into her house.

Two Lake County Sheriff’s deputies and one Eustis officer arrived at the house to investigate, Lt. John Herrell, a Lake County Sheriff spokesman said, adding that “the suspect produced a handgun and threatened the officers with it.”

Authorities have not specified which officer fired and struck Edwards, Herrell said.

The officers involved were not injured in the incident, he said. All three were placed on administrative leave, pending a preliminary review of the incident.

The driver of the van, Billy Lawless, 30, of Eustis, was not injured. None of the five passengers in the van were injured either, Montes said.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.

The officer and deputies involved are on standard administrative leave.
