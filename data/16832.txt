A Cherokee County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a knife-wielding man who stabbed four other patients at a drug rehabilitation center west of Fort Gibson on Friday evening, the Sheriff’s Office confirmed.

Sheriff’s deputies responded about 7:15 p.m. to a 911 call reporting that a patient at Faith Based Therapeutic Community Corp. had stabbed four other patients and had set a barn on fire, Undersheriff Jason Chennault said.

When deputies arrived at the facility in Norwood, between Fort Gibson and Tahlequah, the assailant was hiding at the back of the property and fled as soon as he saw them. The deputies found him hiding in an outbuilding, shined their lights on him and told him to get down, but he advanced toward them with a knife in his hand, Chennault said.

One deputy opened fire, fatally shooting the man, the undersheriff said. He was pronounced dead at the scene by an ambulance crew that was already there to treat the patients who had been stabbed, he said.

Three of them were taken to a Muskogee hospital, but the fourth person wasn’t hurt badly enough to be transported, Chennault said. He didn’t know the conditions of those who were taken to the hospital.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation was called in to investigate the shooting.

The identities of the deputy who fired the shots and the person who was killed had not been released by authorities as of Saturday evening.
