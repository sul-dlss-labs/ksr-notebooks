East Precinct conducted another successful Stolen Vehicle Operation (SVO) this weekend.



On Saturday, July 29, 2023, members of East Precinct were joined by the Port of Portland Police, Gresham Police, Multnomah County Parole and Probation, and the Multnomah County District Attorneyâ€™s Office, as they sought to find and arrest people who were actively driving stolen vehicles in our community. In keeping with their goal of conducting fewer traffic stops with a higher likelihood of the vehicles being stolen, SVO has again improved upon their ratio. Previously, their best mission resulted in 15 stolen vehicles from 30 traffic stops. This weekend they stopped 21 vehicles, 12 of which were found to be stolen.
