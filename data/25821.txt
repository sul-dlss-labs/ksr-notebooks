A man was shot and killed by an officer near a southwest Atlanta strip club early Sunday after he allegedly showed a handgun during a foot chase.

According to the GBI, the officer was flagged down by a citizen around 1 a.m. while patrolling outside the Goldrush Showbar on Metropolitan Parkway. He was asked to look into a report of armed person near the ramp to northbound I-85.

The officer made contact with a man, identified by the GBI as 31-year-old Oscar Cain, and attempted to arrest him, spokeswoman Natalie Ammons said. Cain took off running into a wooded area on Connell Avenue, in a residential area behind the strip club. The officer pursued.

“Cain did not comply with verbal commands and during the incident, Cain reportedly brandished a firearm,” Ammons said in a statement. “The officer discharged his weapon, fatally wounding Cain. A firearm was found at the scene.”

The officer, who was not identified, was not injured.

Ammons said the GBI will continue to investigate the officer-involved shooting, the 26th such investigation the agency has opened in 2019.
