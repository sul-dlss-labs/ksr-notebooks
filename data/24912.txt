East Orange Police officers shot a man Tuesday night after he boarded a public bus and held a gun to the head of bus driver and ordered her to drive through red lights, police said.

The man, later identified as Allen Travers, 37, of East Orange, died of his wounds at a Newark hospital.

Travers was involved in a domestic dispute at his home and went on the bus armed with a weapon, at about 9:40 p.m., Acting Essex County Prosecutor Theodore Stephens, II said in a statement.

Authorities did not immediately say how police learned of the situation, but officers followed Travers. As they approached the bus, he pointed a gun at them. However, they continued to follow the bus, officials said.

On board, Travers pointed his gun at the female bus drivers's head and ordered her to drive through red lights before telling her to stop near Central Avenue and South 10th Street in Newark, Stephens said.

When he left the bus he pointed his gun at the East Orange Police officers that followed him and they fired, the statement said.

Travers was taken to University Hospital in Newark and was pronounced dead at 11:16 p.m.

No other information was released Wednesday night.

The Essex County Prosecutor's Office Professional Standards Bureau was investigating the incident as they do whenever an officer fires their gun.
