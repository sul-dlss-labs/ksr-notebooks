Detroit police are investigating separate incidents that played out last night that included a quintuple shooting, a police chase, and gunfire exchanges with law enforcement that killed one.

Police say both scenes are connected.

The first scene occurred at Ward and McNichols Sunday night when five people were shot. Nobody hurt in that initial scene died. However, police said that an individual who was struck by a car nearby had died may have been involved.

Detroit Police Chief James Craig spoke Monday morning, addressing the violence.

A while later, a police chase ensued that ended on 8 Mile and Gratiot Monday morning. Police currently have a large section of the road closed.

State troopers that became involved in assisting with the first investigation said it was later determined that the suspect involved in the earlier incident had fired shots at police who were at the crime scene.

He then led the police on a chase north.

The suspect was reportedly driving a black GMC when he traveled north on Gratiot before getting to 8 Mile. At that point, the suspect exited his vehicle at a strip mall just south of 8 Mile and ran west toward Mohican Street.

While fleeing, he fired shots at police who returned fire.

The suspect was killed as a result of the shooting.

There were more than 70 evidence markers at the scene, indicating the breadth of the investigation that unfolded.
