The Rogers County Sheriff’s office said a woman stole a Chouteau police cruiser, crashed and later ran into traffic and was killed.

Deputies are blocking traffic Monday night on Highway 412 near the Verdigris river.

Officials said a Chouteau officer was transporting a person for a mental health evaluation and stopped at a convenience store. The sheriff’s office said somehow the suspect got control of the car and took off.

They said she bailed near Highway 412 and 321st East Ave in Rogers County. Officials are using a dog to search and Tulsa Police said they are sending their helicopter to assist.
