PATERSON â€” Paterson police fatally shot a man after he opened fire on them during a lengthy standoff.

Officers had responded to David Elcock's Paterson home around 3:30 p.m. Friday after they were told he had a handgun and had expressed his intent to shoot at someone so he might in turn be shot and killed, Passaic County Prosecutor Camelia M. Valdes said Saturday.

A police negotiation team also responded and tried for several hours to get Elcock to surrender, but he refused and eventually ran from the home around 7 p.m.

After refusing directives to drop his weapon, he fired one shot at a group of about 12 officers, who returned fire.

Valdes said Elcock was struck multiple times, but further details were not immediately disclosed.
