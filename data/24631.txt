CLEVELAND, OH (WOIO) - Officials say 25-year-old Ashley Martin died at University Hospitals on Saturday from the incapacitating injuries she sustained as a passenger of the suspect vehicle of the Highway Patrol chase in Cleveland that morning.

The driver of the suspect vehicle, 30-year-old Antonio Whitley, was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Highway Patrol.

Police say a 17-year-old riding in the back seat of the suspect vehicle was injured from the crash and transported to University Hospitals.

His identity and condition has yet to be released.

The pursuit reportedly started after the the 2004 Chrysler Pacifica failed to yield for a traffic stop initiated by Highway Patrol for a red light violation eastbound on St. Clair Avenue near East 93rd Street at 1:11 a.m.

According to Highway Patrol, the sergeant located the suspect vehicle just two minutes later against a utility pole near the intersection of St. Claire Avenue at East 124th Street.

A crash investigation reveals the suspect vehicle reportedly struck the utility pole after traveling to the left of center of the north curb of St. Claire Avenue, over correcting, then traveling off the right side of the roadway.

The suspect vehicle sustained the most severe damage on the area of the driver's door with both the front and side air bags deployed, Highway Patrol says.

None of the suspect vehicle's occupants were reportedly wearing seat belts at the time of the crash.

Ohio State Highway Patrol continues to investigate this crash, but believes alcohol has played a factor.
