A teenage gunman shot two students outside a Wisconsin high school's prom Saturday night, authorities said. Police shot the gunman, who died early Sunday.

The incident took place outside Antigo High School about 11 p.m. (12 a.m. ET).

Antigo Police Chief Eric Roller said the suspect, Jakob E. Wagner, 18, showed up with a rifle and opened fire outside the prom, wounding two students who were exiting the event.

Antigo, Wisconsin, police identified Jakob E. Wagner as the shooter at Antigo High School. Facebook

"Officers were in the parking lot patrolling the activities and heard the shots," Roller said in a statement. "An officer immediately fired upon the shooter, stopping the threat."

Wagner died early Sunday after "lifesaving measures" were administered at a hospital, Roller said.

Donald Childs, administrator of the Unified School District of Antigo, said in a statement Sunday that one of the victims — an Antigo student — had received a non-life-threatening injury and was undergoing surgery on his leg.

The student's date, who was from out-of-state, was treated Saturday night for a graze wound and released, Childs added.

Crisis counselors will be available for students upon their return Monday, he said.

Childs said Wagner was a "student with a disability" who had graduated from Antigo. He was working for what Childs described as a "community-based support/transition agency" that paid him to volunteer in Antigo's art department.

"So he was frequently in the school," Childs added.

An acquaintance of the suspect's, Dylan Dewey, told NBC News that Wagner "was fun to be around."

"When we talked, it was always a good time," Dewey said. "He would laugh and smile when around his friends."

Dewey added that Wagner was dating someone at Antigo, although they'd recently broken up.
