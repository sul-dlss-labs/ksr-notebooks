No charges will be filed against a Pittsylvania County sheriff's deputy who shot and killed an inmate during a struggle in December.

Campbell County Commonwealth's Attorney Neil Vener, special prosecutor in the case, issued a report to Pittsylvania County Sheriff Mike Taylor yesterday stating deputy Roger Wayne Walden was justified in using deadly force against Cody Christopher Nifong.

Nifong, 24, was shot and killed Dec. 16 during an attempt to escape from Walden's car.

Nifong, who was in custody in Pittsylvania County Jail awaiting sentencing for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old, was returning from psychological evaluation in Midlothian at the time of the incident, which occurred about a block from the jail.

While being transported to Chatham in the back of Walden's police car, Nifong slipped a hand out of his handcuffs and reached through the open security partition in the vehicle, Vener wrote in the report. The inmate tried to strangle Walden, the report states.

Walden told investigators he was forced to shoot Nifong to avoid being strangled.

The special prosecutor said investigators found a cord in Nifong's cell similar to the one he used, and inmates at the jail reported he previously said he intended to escape from custody.

Walden's failure to properly secure Nifong's handcuffs and to close and secure the partition in the car provided Nifong a chance to escape, Vener wrote. His use of deadly force was justified because he had reasonable belief he was in danger of being killed or seriously injured, the prosecutor's report concluded.

Walden is a 21-year veteran of the sheriff's office. Attempts to reach Taylor last night to find out if the deputy has returned to active duty were unsuccessful.
