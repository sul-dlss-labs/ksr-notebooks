A Springfield man pleaded guilty to killing a woman as he fled from a traffic stop.

Raymone West, 26, is currently in custody on federal drug trafficking charges but could spend another 11 years behind state bars for his local crimes.

West was the driver when his speeding car hit and killed a 37-year-old Springfield woman last November on Linden Avenue.

Shannon Gonzalez of Springfield was walking along Linden Road with a man and died after she was pinned underneath Westâ€™s car when he crashed, according to court records.

West pleaded guilty last week to charges of involuntary manslaughter and trafficking in heroin, said Clark County Assistant Prosecutor Ryan Saunders.

Investigators found a large amount of cash and drugs in the car, said Lt. Brian Aller of the State Highway Patrol at the time of the cash. More than 160 grams of heroin, narcotic pills and marijuana were confiscated from the scene.

West is scheduled to be back in local court on Nov. 21, according to records, for his sentencing.

He could face a maximum of 11 years in prison for the crime, Saunders said.

The Springfield man is in federal custody after he was arrested by the Drug Enforcement Agency in February for his part in a cocaine drug network in Ohio, according to federal court records.

He is charged in federal court with conspiracy and possession of drugs with the intent to distribute.

West was driving in Springfield in November when troopers saw his car with a broken headlight on South Limestone Street shortly before 11 p.m., according to court documents. The trooper stopped the car near Linden Avenue and Washington Street.

When the car stopped and the trooper exited his vehicle, a passenger fled on foot and West sped away.

The trooper chased the car on Linden, according to the affidavit, before it ran a red light at Selma Road and the driver lost control, jumping the curb and striking and killing Gonzalez.

The other pedestrian was treated at a local hospital for a broken leg.
