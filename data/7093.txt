A St. Louis police officer shot and killed a man attempting an armed robbery of the Denny's Restaurant at 1515 Hampton Ave., early Friday.

Police said Brett D. Holloway, 37, of Waynesville, was pronounced dead at 2:02 a.m., at an area hospital after being shot several times by an officer who was working a secondary job as a security guard at the restaurant.

Homicide detectives were called to the restaurant at 1:25 a.m., police said. The detectives were told the officer was seated at the counter in uniform when Holloway entered the front door and pulled a stocking down over his face.

The man then pulled out a dark colored handgun and pointed it at the officer and other employees at the counter. The officer drew his service weapon and fired several times, striking Holloway.

Holloway fell behind the counter still armed. The officer ordered him to drop his weapon and when Holloway refused, the officer fired several more shots at him.

Holloway had multiple gunshot wounds. He was tentatively identified through a driver's license found in a vehicle located in the rear of the building. Neither the officer nor other employees were injured.

The officer, who was not identified, had been on the police department for a little more than two years.
