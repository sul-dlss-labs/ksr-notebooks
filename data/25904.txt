A man wanted on felony child molestation charges in Indiana shot himself as Alabama lawmen tried to take him into custody Monday morning.

Russell County Sheriff Heath Taylor said deputies about 10 a.m. Monday went to a home on Lato Road in Seale after getting a tip that fugitive Christopher Allen Garner Sr. was staying at the residence. Taylor said once they got to the scene, they met with family members who verified Garner was inside.

Investigators made entry into the home at which point the sheriff said Garner shot himself before he was able to be taken into custody. He was transported Piedmont Hospital. His condition is unknown.

Garner was wanted on two felony counts of child molestation by the Madison County Sheriffâ€™s Department in Indiana. The investigation has been turned over to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency.
