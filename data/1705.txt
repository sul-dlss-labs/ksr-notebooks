An Anaheim man was shot and killed by police Wednesday after he refused to surrender at the end of a car chase, police said.

Hoa Kieu Duong, 28, was fatally shot about 12:40 a.m. as he tried to rock his car off the median of Valley View Street in Garden Grove, where his vehicle became stuck after being bumped from behind in a standard police maneuver to end pursuits.

Duong was driving in Fullerton on Brookhurst Street near the Riverside Freeway just after midnight when police tried to pull him over for a traffic violation, said Lt. Scott Hamilton, Garden Grove police spokesman.

After running a license plates check, police realized that the registered owner had an outstanding warrant for aggravated assault.

As the chase proceeded along Valley View Street, a few blocks east of the San Diego Freeway, a Fullerton police cruiser bumped the rear of Duong’s car, sending it onto the divider. Other cruisers caught up and circled him.

Duong was ordered to surrender, Hamilton said. After Duong refused, officers reportedly tried to stop him by firing several rounds from beanbag guns. But Duong tried to drive through the blockade, Hamilton said, putting his car in reverse and drive.

Two officers, one from Fullerton and one from Garden Grove, then fired the fatal shots with their regular weapons, he said.

“At some point, officers felt their lives or those of other officers were threatened, and they fired at the suspect,” Hamilton said.

The Orange County district attorney’s office, which reviews all police shootings, is investigating.
