ZEBULON, N.C. â€” Exactly one week after a kidnapping suspect led Raleigh police on a high-speed chase, more information is coming out on the minute-by-minute decisions the officers made.

The chase shut down roads and schools during the morning commute as police raced to capture Hugo Yaret Cortes-Ramirez, 23, who was wanted in the alleged kidnapping of a woman.

Investigators later found him dead just off Highway 64 in Zebulon.

The officer who exchanged gunfire with the suspect is on administrative leave while the State Bureau of Investigation looks into the matter, a standard response when an officer discharges their weapon.

The officer was wearing a body camera, but the battery died and didn't capture the incident.

Raleigh police say other officers did have their body cameras and dash cameras rolling and they are asking the court if they can release that video.

But the report makes it very clear, the officer's actions are not suspected in the death of Cortes-Ramirez because an investigation indicates that his death resulted from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The chase and investigation put an entire community on edge as roads were blocked and schools were shut down while officers searched for Cortes-Ramirez, who has amassed nine mugshots from arrests in Wake County since 2013.

It all began with a report that he had taken a woman hostage in his car..

Officers saw the woman screaming for help in the car, and they chased the suspect's Honda Accord from Raleigh to Zebulon.

The chase reached speeds of close to 100 miles per hour before the State Highway Patrol disabled the car with stop sticks on Highway 64 East..

His vehicle stopped before he fled on foot into the woods.

Officers say they saw a pistol in the driver's right hand and say he shot at them, gunfire returned by a Raleigh officer.

The woman was rescued from the car unharmed.
