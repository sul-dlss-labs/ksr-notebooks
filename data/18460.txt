Greta Kurian was pronounced dead at the scene. Her husband, a rookie South Gate police officer, was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police suspect Kyle Kurian killed his wife before shooting himself, but the case is under investigation by homicide detectives.

Investigators recovered a handgun inside the condo.

According to Kyle Kurian’s LinkedIn page, he briefly worked for the Los Angeles Police Department. The South Gate Police Department confirmed Tuesday that he recently joined their force.

The couple’s children, a toddler and an infant, were at home during the shooting and were placed in the care of the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services.

Family members of the slain couple have started an online campaign to raise money for the educational needs of the two young children.
