Jason M. Hendley, a 29-year-old black man, was killed during an officer-involved shooting on Monday, July 6, in the 13600 block of Gavina Avenue in Sylmar, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

The incident began about 10:30 a.m., when Los Angeles police officers responded to a call about a possible assault at a Sylmar home, according to LAPD spokeswoman Liliana Preciado.

When officers arrived they saw a man, later identified as Hendley, walking out of the house covered in blood and wielding a knife, Preciado said. Hendley allegedly advanced toward the officers with a knife in hand and the officers opened fire.

Hendley was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition. He was pronounced dead at 7:46 that evening, according to coroner’s records.

After the shooting, officers went inside the home and found a man with multiple stab wounds.

The stabbing victim, Jon Robert Cummings, a 53-year-old white male, was pronounced dead at the scene at 10:45 a.m.

LAPD Capt. Todd Chamberlain told reporters that Cummings was the fiancé of Hendley’s mother. He said Hendley, his mother, his brother and Cummings were in the house when an argument broke out.

Chamberlain said Hendley’s brother tried to fight him off while he allegedly was stabbing Cummings. After the stabbing, Hendley left the house, and his mother and brother were able to leave.
