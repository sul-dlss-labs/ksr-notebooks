A man was pulled from a canal near Doral Friday morning after a car plunged into the water following a police chase.

DORAL, Fla. – A man was pulled from a canal near Doral Friday morning after a car plunged into the water following a police chase.

Sky 10 was above the area of Northwest 117th Avenue and 58th Street at 6:50 a.m. as divers brought the man out of the water and helped place him on a stretcher.

The man was then airlifted to a hospital, where he died.

Authorities confirmed that Doral police officers spotted the stolen white Volkswagen around 6:15 a.m. and attempted to pull over the driver.

Police said the driver fled from officers and police stopped chasing him after he left Doral city limits.

“He went past 117th Avenue, which is outside city limits, and it’s also unpaved – a lot of woods, a lot of unmarked territory back there,” Doral police spokesman Rey Valdes said.

It was discovered a short time later that the driver had crashed the car into a canal near Doral Meadow Park.

“We observed a plume of I guess you can say dust -- there’s a dirt road. We thought that maybe he had gone into that dirt road, which parallels the Turnpike, at which point we saw the vehicle in the canal,” Valdes said.

Doral police and officers from the Miami-Dade Police Department were spotted at the scene.

Divers from Miami-Dade Fire Rescue pulled the driver from the water.

His identity has not yet been released.
