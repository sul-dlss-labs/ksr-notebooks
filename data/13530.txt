HYDE PARK >> Excessive speed and reckless driving are believed to have caused an Oct. 13 accident on state Route 9G that killed a 23-year-old town of Poughkeepsie man, according to the Dutchess County Sheriff’s Office.

Joshua Bohlmann was declared dead at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie shortly after the 3 a.m. accident.

Bohlmann, who was operating the motorcycle with a learner’s permit, was southbound on Route 9G when he lost control of his motorcycle, crossed into the northbound lane, went off the shoulder and struck a sign post, deputies said.

Investigators said eyewitness accounts indicated Bohlmann and another motorcyclist, Anthony Derienzo, 22, of Poughkeepsie, were riding together recklessly and at excessive speeds.

The two were approached at a red light by two sheriff’s deputies, but the men ignored the “lawful directives to stop” and drove away, once again recklessly and at excessive speeds, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

Bohlmann lost control of his motorcycle and crashed on Route 9G in the area of Cottage Street.

Derienzo has been charged with unlawfully fleeing a police officer, reckless driving and speeding.
