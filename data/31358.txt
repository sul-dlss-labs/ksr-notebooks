NEW KENT â€” A teenager from Yorktown has been charged with multiple felonies after leading Virginia State Police (VSP) on a chase that resulted in the death of a 17-year-old girl on Oct. 24, according to a VSP press release.

Jahreese R. Watson-Ricks, 18, has been charged with felony homicide, involuntary manslaughter, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, reckless driving and felony eluding, and hit and run, among other charges.

Just before 1 a.m. on Sunday Oct. 24, VSP troopers attempted to stop a white Infiniti sedan that Watson-Ricks was driving at a high rate of speed on Interstate 64 East in New Kent.

While evading the police, Watson-Ricks got off the interstate at mile marker 227 and continued to flee along Route 249 near Kenthurst Road. He then ran the car off the road, striking trees and subsequently catching fire.

Watson-Ricks attempted to flee on foot but was quickly located. Watson and his passenger were both taken to a local hospital to be treated for injuries. The passenger died the next day on Oct. 25.

VSP says the incident is still under investigation.
