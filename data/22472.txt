GARY | A robbery suspect was shot to death by return fire from police Monday night, Gary police spokeswoman Gabrielle King said

The robbery victim told police he was driving northbound on Broadway near 25th Avenue about 11 p.m. when approached by two men who jumped into his car, King said.The men instructed the victim to drive to a bank where he was told to withdraw money through an ATM.

When the withdrawal failed at the first bank, King said the men ordered the victim to drive to another bank where the men took his car and fled.

Flagged down by the victim, police officers pursued the car until it crashed at 11th Avenue and Grant Street, King said. Shots were fired at police, resulting in one of the suspects being shot by return fire.

A spokesman for the Lake County Coroner identified the dead man as Terrel Spires, 20, of Gary.

Spires suffered multiple gunshot wounds to the body and was declared dead at 2 a.m. by a coroner's investigator, the spokesman said.

Because of the officer involvement, the shooting incident is also under investigation by the Lake County Sheriff's Department.
