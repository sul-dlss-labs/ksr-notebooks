RICHMOND, Va. -- Police have released the names of the man and woman killed in an apparent murder-suicide on Richmond's Southside early Sunday morning.

Neighbors called police around 5 a.m. after they heard shots fired during what police said was a domestic situation in a Hillside Court apartment in the 1600 block of Glenfield Avenue.

When officers arrived, an armed male suspect, identified as 30-year-old Brian A. Harris, was holed up inside the residence and refused to come out.

As officers approached the apartment, one of the units heard a gunshot from inside the home, according to officers.

Police said they backed off, established a perimeter and called the Richmond SWAT Team to assist. Some neighbors in surrounding homes were evacuated as a precaution.

More officers arrived a short time later. Police said attempts to contact the people inside failed.

When units reported hearing a second gunshot, the SWAT team entered the home.

Officers discovered Harris and 29-year-old Shantisha L. Dortch dead from apparent gunshot wounds.

WTVR CBS 6 reporter Claudia Rupcich spoke to a neighbor who said she knew the couple.

"I was just traumatized because I was worried about my friends," said TeaTee, who lives next door. "This is a very, very tragic situation."

TeaTee said the couple was having a fight when the shooting happened.

"I feel as though he wasn't in the right state of mind at the time," said TeaTee.

Neighbors gathered outside the victim's apartment with balloons and teddy bears Sunday afternoon to honor the couple, who leaves behind two kids.

"They gone today, but we're going to celebrate the life that they had while they were here on this earth," TeaTee said.

Police are asking anyone with information on the incident to call Major Crimes Detective Jon Bridges at 804- 646-4494 or Crime Stoppers at 804-780-1000.
