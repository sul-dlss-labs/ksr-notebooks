ST. LOUIS â€¢ A teenager who led police on a chase in his stolen car, then struck and killed the driver of another car after he blew through several stop signs, pleaded guilty this week to second degree murder and other charges.

Leneko Dominek Waller, 16, of St. Louis, will be sentenced on Jan. 7 in St. Louis Circuit Court. His case was transferred from juvenile court based on the seriousness of the offense.

Angela Robertson,a 20-year-old child care worker, was headed to her Dellwood home on March 17 when Waller, leading an officer in a chase down West Florissant Avenue, crashed into Robertson's car with the Mazda MX6 that he had taken in a carjacking five days earlier. Robertson was pronounced dead at St. Louis University Hospital and a passenger in her car was seriously injured.

In addition to the murder charge, Waller pleaded guilty on Monday to tampering with a motor vehicle, resisting arrest and second degree assault charges.
