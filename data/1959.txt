God Bless America

Even though New York and Washington DC are thousands of miles away, the world still feels the sting of Septemer 11, 2001. Many memorials are planned for the day – citizens are also asked to drive with their lights on, as well as wear red, white and blue during the day. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families of those affected by September 11.
