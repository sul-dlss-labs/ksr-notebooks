FORT LAWN, S.C. (AP) â€” A 36-year-old man killed himself after a shoot-out with an off-duty reserve police officer and a hit-and-run collision, authorities say.

An autopsy Wednesday showed Gary Wayne Smith of Fort Lawn was shot five times by the officer but died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, said Chester County Coroner Watson Wright.

Officer Paul Christmas, 48, of Rock Hill, told authorities Smith sideswiped his pickup truck Tuesday on U.S. Highway 21 and drove away.

Christmas followed Smith to a private driveway to confront him when Smith shot at the officer with a .22-caliber pistol, said Chester County Chief Deputy Bernie Culpepper.

The men fired many shots, but only Smith was hit, Culpepper said.

After the shooting, Smith retreated into a nearby field, where he shot himself in the head, investigators said.

The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating the incident, but Chester County authorities say Christmas was justified in shooting Smith.

"I think Paul did the right thing," said Fort Lawn Police Chief Richard Smith. "It's just a tragic incident."

Chester County Sheriff Robby Benson said, "If somebody shoots at me, I'm going to shoot back."
