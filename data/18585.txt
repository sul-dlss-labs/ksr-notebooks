A man was shot Tuesday night in Stonewood after pointing a pellet gun at Harrison County deputies.

According to investigators, a capias was issued for Codey Hardman. Hardman has plead guilty to armed robbery in the past and violated his probation. He failed to show up for a probation revocation hearing. That is why the warrant was served.

When deputies went into a home on Hazelwood Avenue in Stonewood, Hardman pointed a pellet gun at an officer. The officer shot Hardman.

The pellet gun was a replica of a .45 caliber Smith & Wesson.

Hardman was taken to Ruby Memorial Hospital and is in critical condition.

Neighbors on Hazelwood Avenue expressed shock Wednesday.

"I never expected anything like this to happen here," said Matthew Young, who just moved into the neighborhood six months ago. "Everyone seems pretty nice."

The investigation into this incident is ongoing.
