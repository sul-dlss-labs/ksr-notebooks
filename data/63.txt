A parole violator who barricaded himself inside a home for seven hours was killed Monday morning during a shootout with sheriff’s deputies, authorities said.

After a prolonged standoff during which he opened fire on police, Alex Montelongo, 25, was shot by members of a SWAT team about 3 a.m., police said.

A sheriff’s sergeant was shot in the hands and was in stable condition at a nearby hospital. A sheriff’s K-9 dog was also injured.

The incident began about 7:45 p.m. Sunday when Montelongo was stopped for a traffic violation and a license plate check revealed he was a parolee at large, authorities said. The suspect ran away from deputies and into a house in the 9400 block of Beverly Road.

“He did not know anyone in there,” said sheriff’s spokesman Mark Bailey. “Those occupants fled the house and went to a neighbor’s house, where they called police.”

A SWAT team attempted to enter the house and was met immediately with gunshots, Bailey said. Deputies returned fire and retreated outside.

Deputies then fired tear gas into the home and sent in a sheriff’s dog. After hearing a struggle, police recalled the dog, which emerged severely limping.

A second round of tear gas finally forced Montelongo outside, where he was shot and killed when he tried to reach for a weapon, Bailey said.

The dog was in good condition at a veterinary hospital.
