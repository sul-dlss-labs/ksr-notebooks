St. Louis police made the fullest accounting yet this morning of a shooting rampage in which an employee of ABB, Inc., killed three co-workers and wounded five at the north side electric transformer plant last Jan. 7.

Among the details explained by Capt. Michael Sack of the homicide unit:

• The attacker, Timothy Hendron, 51, bought two of the four weapons he used - an AK-47 rifle and 12-gauge shotgun - the day before the spree.

• One of Hendron's targets, Stephen Sharp Sr., 55, was armed and returned fire, missing with six shots from a .380 caliber pistol. Sharp played dead and survived critical wounds.

• Hendron eventually went into an office, sat in a chair and shot himself dead.

Police have spent more than 10 months reviewing the circumstances and their response, which included more than 400 law enforcement officers. A 150-page report was delivered to the Board of Police Commissioners at its meeting this morning.

Hendron, of Webster Groves, began shooting about 6:30 a.m. at the facility on Semple Avenue, beside Interstate 70, around shift change time. He had been an assembler for about 30 years. Friends have said he had complained about pressure and conflicts with supervisors. He also was part of a class-action lawsuit against ABB over 401(k) retirement plan fees.

Killed were Carlton J. Carter, 57, of St. Louis; Terry Mabry, 55, of Moscow Mills; and Cory Wilson, 27, of Collinsville. Carter and Mabry were shot outside the plant, Wilson inside.

Besides Sharp, of O'Fallon, Mo., the survivors of wounds were Darrell Buckley, 51, of St. Louis; Keith Garner, 51, of Florissant; John Green, 56, of Ferguson; and Jerry Brown, 52, of St. Louis.

Fifteen others were shot at but not hit, Sack said.

Police gave this timeline:

• 6:34 a.m. First 911 call reports shots. Three patrol cars dispatched.

• 6:35 a.m. Second 911 call. Three more cars dispatched.

• 6:36 to 6:38 a.m. Multiple 911 calls. One reports a man on top of the building shot. EMS is dispatched and police get the first description of the suspect as a white male wearing a brown shirt and blue jeans.

• 6:39 a.m. First officers arrive and are forced back from the entrance.

• 6:40 to 6:43 a.m. More calls flood the 911 center. One erroneously describes the suspect as a black male, wearing a tan jacket and carrying an assault rifle.

• 6:48 a.m. Five additional police cars are dispatched.

• 6:49 a.m. Police call for an "Emergency Mobilization," and first officers enter the building.

• 6:50 to 6:55 a.m. 15 additional cars dispatched.

• 6:55 to 8 a.m. Uninjured victims are removed and taken to to the North Patrol headquarters for interviews.

• 8:22 a.m. The Hostage Response Team prepares an entry plan

• 9 a.m. HRT officers enter the sprawling plant, joined by officers from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration, Missouri Highway Patrol and St. Louis County police. The complex has six interconnected buildings for a total of 764,000 square feet

• 9:20 a.m. Police locate Timothy Hendron dead in chair, with a pistol at his feet. They collect a .45 caliber pistol, a .40 caliber pistol, the AK-47 and shotgun, 106 AK-47 casings, 5 spent shotgun shells and various unused ammunition, including 53 AK-47 rounds, 5 shotgun rounds, 18 .45 caliber rounds and 20 .40 caliber rounds.

• In all, 308 city police responded, along with 42 firefighters and EMS personnel, 39 St. Louis County officers, 18 Highway Patrol officers, 20 FBI agents, 15 Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents and 12 DEA agents.
