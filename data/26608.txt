An alleged abduction earlier this week ended with the suicide of the alleged captor as police closed in.

At 10:57 p.m., Sept. 16, London Police responded to a dispute at the Speedway store, 102 W. High St. Callers reported an individual with a handgun was attempting to take a vehicle, according to a London Police Department news release.

A Madison County Sheriff’s Office deputy located the individual, who had fled the scene to a nearby neighborhood. As officers caught up to him walking down the street, the individual held a handgun to his head and told them to stay away, according to the release.

He then sat down on the curb and fired one shot into his head. Medics responded and pronounced Shane C. Iams, 50, of London, dead at the scene, London Police Chief Glenn Nicol said.

An initial investigation determined Iams had allegedly abducted an ex-girlfriend from her nearby home at gunpoint. She was able to attempt an escape at the Speedway store, where Iams allegedly fled from her and her vehicle.

The incident remains under investigation by the London Police, the Madison County Sheriff’s Office and the Madison County Coroner’s Office.

Nicol says the coroner’s office has not yet released any further information regarding the case.
