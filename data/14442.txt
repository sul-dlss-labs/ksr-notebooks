SHELBY COUNTY, TX (KTRE) - A Shelby County grand jury has no-billed the two law enforcement officers that fatally shot a suspect who struck a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper with the stolen pickup that he was driving on May 4.

The Shelby County grand jury issued the ruling on July 1.

According to Shelby County District Attorney Ken Florence, DPS trooper Dustin Ramos and Center Police officer Dwayne Gordon will not be charged in the death of 38-year-old Jonathan Swindle. Florence said the two law enforcement officers fired approximately 20 shots at Swindle, and five of them struck him.

Texas Ranger Brian Brazil told the Shelby County district attorney's office that he believed the two officers did not exceed their legal rights when they fired at Swindle, who had just struck and injured DPS Trooper Zach Mills.

In addition, an autopsy revealed that Swindle had PCP in his system, Florence said.

According to a previous East Texas News story, the incident occurred around 6:25 p.m. on May 4. Law enforcement officials were trying to stop a stolen 2003 Dodge pickup driven by Swindle on State Highway 87 near FM 139 near Center. Mills had just thrown out a spike strip in an effort to stop Swindle.

A DPS spokesman said the pickup veered around the spike strip and struck Mills, who was outside his patrol vehicle and in a bar ditch at the side of the road. Ramos and Gordon fired on Swindle after he continued on into a nearby pasture.

"You could see the police officers standing in the parking lot and shooting," Clifton said. "It was a pretty crazy ordeal. I've never seen anything like that, so for a small town, it's pretty chaotic."

Mills was transported to the Good Shepherd Medical Center in Longview with a possible broken leg.
