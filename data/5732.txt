A police officer fatally shot an armed 19-year-old during a struggle in the vestibule of a South Bronx apartment building last night, the police said. The police said that the officer fired five shots at the man, identified by his mother as Timur Person, and that at least one of them hit him in the chest.

A friend of Mr. Person’s who witnessed the shooting, Hector Suarez, said that Mr. Person had a gun tucked into his waistband. “They were punching and kicking him,” Mr. Suarez said. “All I kept hearing was: ‘Let go of the gun! Let go of the gun!’ ”

A loaded .380-caliber semiautomatic pistol was found at the scene, the police said.

According to a preliminary account provided by the police, Mr. Person was with three other men in front of 1240 Walton Avenue when a sergeant and three officers from the 44th Precinct approached them about 8:15 p.m. It was not immediately clear why the officers approached, but the block is a high-crime area, and the officers were part of a “conditions team” that focuses on trouble spots, the police said.

As the other men fled, Mr. Person ran into the building. One of the officers followed him, and the two began to struggle, the police said. They said the other three officers followed and joined in the struggle.
