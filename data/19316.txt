Police now confirm a man stabbed his wife Wednesday night before killing himself in a Yukon apartment in the 300 block of Point Parkway Boulevard.



Officers were called to the Park on West Pointe Apartment Complex at 8:20 p.m. for a domestic disturbance. They found a woman outside the apartment who'd been stabbed. When they went inside, they found another man suffering from serious injuries in a bathroom.

Police now say it appears the man attacked his wife then injured himself. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead. His wife is still alive and in stable condition in a hospital.



Witnesses tell News 9 the two were in the middle of a divorce. They also say the couple's three children were in the apartment at the time of the assault. The children are now in the custody of the Department of Human Services.

Police say because this is a domestic violence case, the names of the husband and wife will not be released.
