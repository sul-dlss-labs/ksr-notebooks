GREELEY, Colo — A man who refused to leave a Greeley home for hours on Wednesday died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound while SWAT members and police surrounded the home, a release from the Greeley Police Department (GPD) says.

GPD on Wednesday afternoon responded to a restraining order violation in the 2800 block of Aspen Avenue.that led to the hours-long SWAT standoff.

Officers arrived and contacted a man who refused to leave the residence, GPD said. Officers at the scene learned there were four other people inside that the man was holding against their will with a handgun, GPD said.

The GPD's SWAT Team along with the Crisis Negotiations Unit responded immediately and began negotiating with the man.

GPD said SWAT and officers were able to remove two small children from the upper story of the home. The man eventually released another victim and after several hours of negotiation, the fourth victim was able to run outside and was rescued by officers, GPD said.

After everyone else was out of the home, officers at the scene heard a single gunshot from inside the residence, GPD said. They later found the man dead inside the home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The man's name will be released by the Weld County Coroner’s Office.
