Original Press Release



Los Angeles County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau detectives are continuing their investigation into the circumstances surrounding an officer-involved shooting that occurred Saturday, November 23, 2013, in the 9200 block of San Luis Avenue, South Gate at 10:08 pm..



Detectives have learned that South Gate police officers responded to a 911 call of a man and woman fighting. Additional information indicated that the male was possibly armed with a handgun. Multiple Officers arrived and attempted to contact the male. The male suspect was uncooperative and failed to respond to officers' directions.



As officers attempted to detain the male, he ran away from them, continually grasping at his waistband area. The suspect suddenly turned back toward officers. Fearing that the suspect had armed himself, an officer-involved shooting occurred.



A weapon was recovered from the suspect.

The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.



Whenever an Officer Involved Shooting occurs multiple independent investigations immediately begin at the scene. These include separate investigations by the Office of the Los Angeles County District Attorney in addition to investigations by Sheriff's Homicide Bureau and Internal Affairs.
