Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting killing a man at house in Springfield.

Lt. Chris Wells with the Springfield Police Department says officers were dispatched to 521 Latoka Ct. about 3:25 Tuesday afternoon. Police say David White, 56, died.

"They were sent initially on an assault call, where the victim was inside and still being actively assaulted," he said.

As officers entered the home they could hear a woman screaming inside a rear bedroom. Officers entered the bedroom and observed the screaming woman and White who was armed with a handgun. Officers gave the him verbal commands but he refused to comply. One officer fired his duty weapon striking him. Officers and paramedics conducted lifesaving procedures, but the suspect died at the scene.

"They encountered an armed subject inside there, a male subject. During that time, he was shot and killed there on scene," Well said.

Wells said there were other people inside the home at the time of the shooting, but he would not say how many, or how they were related.

"It'll be a lengthy investigation, so they'll be talking to everybody involved and neighbors as well," he said.

Multiple neighbors tell KY3 News they see police officers at the house frequently.

KY3 News looked up how many times officer were called to that exact home in the last year. We found seven calls since Christmas even of last year, five for domestic assault, one assault call. Just three weeks ago, officers were called there for a violation of an order of protection, which means someone had a court order to keep someone else away from them.

According to SPD, the assault victim was treated for her injuries. Police call this an active investigation.
