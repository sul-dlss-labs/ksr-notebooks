A 32-year-old man died Friday afternoon after he attempted to avoid California Highway Patrol officials, possibly while intoxicated, by going more than 100 mph on a freeway in Buena Park before crashing, officials said.

Phillip Chang of Placentia died at 2:18 p.m. Friday after he was hospitalized at UCI Medical Center in Orange with critical injuries following a crash 12 hours earlier.

CHP officials said officers attempted to stop Chang, who was driving at least 100 mph, at 2:17 a.m. on the westbound 91 freeway, east of Knott Avenue, but he refused to stop.

Chang, driving a 2015 Dodge Dart, exited the freeway on Valley View Street before he returned to the 91, headed eastbound, then made “an abrupt turning movement” from the middle lane of the freeway toward the Knott Avenue off-ramp, according to a CHP statement.

In doing so, the Dodge Dart struck a Nissan Versa driven by Daniel Anthony Perez, a 22-year-old Buena Park man, authorities said.

The Dodge spun out of control, crashed through a guardrail, rolled down an embankment and crashed against a brick wall.

“He was going at least 100 mph when he went off the embankment,” said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Larry Kurtz.

Chang was possibly intoxicated at the time of the crash and was not wearing a seatbelt during the incident, officials said.

The other driver was not injured.
