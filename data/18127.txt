Monongalia County deputies have released more details surrounding the fatal shooting of an 82-year-old man while attempting to serve a warrant.

Darrel Hetrick violated a sentencing order by removing his wife from the assisted living home she was in, deputies said. He was ordered to have no contact with her without supervision, according to Sheriff Al Kisner of the Monongalia County Sheriff’s Department.

Hetrick had put his wife in the hospital before, Kisner said, and his department, along with the Monongalia County Prosecutor’s Office, did not want to give him that chance again. The prosecutor’s office asked the sheriff’s department to expedite the arrest.

According to Kisner, Hetrick was not supposed to have any firearms, and he said all firearms were removed from the home after the initial domestic battery incident.

Deputies went to Hetrick’s home on Friday at approximately 3 p.m., when the warrant for his arrest was issued, but he was not home. Deputies returned to Hetrick’s home at approximately 12:30 a.m. Saturday.

When deputies returned, Hetrick threatened them with a handgun, Kisner said, and he refused multiple requests to put the gun down. Kisner said after deputies identified themselves to Hetrick, Hetrick raised the gun at a deputy while threatening to kill him.

The Detective Division of the Monongalia County Sheriff’s Department will conduct an internal review to be sure no policies or procedures were violated during the incident.
