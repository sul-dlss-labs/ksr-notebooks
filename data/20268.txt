Sheriff’s officials on Thursday released the name of a deputy who fatally shot a homeless man accused of stabbing a manager at a Rubio’s restaurant in Solana Beach earlier this week.

Deputy Noah Zarnow shot Emmanuel Ibarra, 34, during a confrontation in Del Mar, officials said.

Zarnow, who has been with the department for five years, shot another man in November.

On Monday, the Rubio’s manager was stabbed at the eatery on South Highway 101 shortly before 4 p.m. He was taken to a hospital, where doctors removed the tip of a knife from his head, officials said. He is expected to fully recover.

Soon after the attack, deputies found Ibarra near a stretch of train tracks a few blocks south near Via De La Valle in Del Mar. Armed with a knife, Ibarra emerged from behind a concrete pillar and moved toward the nearest deputy.

As that deputy backed away, he lost his footing. When his fellow deputy fell, Zarnow shouted at Ibarra, who turned toward him and charged. Zarnow shot Ibarra, who died at a hospital.

In November, Zarnow shot a suspected robber in Encinitas. The suspect led deputies on a brief chase that ended when he crashed his motorcycle in front of a condominium complex on El Camino Real. He then ran, with Zarnow at his heels.

A prosecutor in a case against the suspect said the man racked his gun and aimed it at Zarnow, who shot him.
