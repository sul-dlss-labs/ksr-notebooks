DETROIT – Two people were killed Friday when a car fleeing a traffic stop crashed into a tree on Detroit's west side, Michigan State Police Lt. Mike Shaw said.

MSP troopers said the crash happened at Ashton and Paul avenues.

Troopers said they tried to pull a car over on the Southfield Freeway because the driver and passenger weren't wearing seatbelts.

When the car pulled over in a neighborhood, the driver kept his foot on the brake instead of putting the car in park, Shaw said. When the trooper asked the driver to put the car in park, the car sped off, Shaw said.

While fleeing the scene, the car clipped another vehicle that had the right-of-way, causing the driver of the fleeing car to lose control, Shaw said. The car crashed into a tree, and two people were killed.

The investigation is ongoing, police said.

"Expect police in the area," MSP Metro Detroit tweeted.
