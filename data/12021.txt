A family disturbance call ended with San Bernardino police fatally shooting a 28-year-old man who threw a stick at an officer’s head, investigators say.

The gunfire erupted about 2:30 p.m. in the driveway of the family’s home along the 2400 block of North San Benito Avenue, just northwest of Highland Avenue and Macy Street.

Johnny Louis Gonzalez died about 4 p.m. at a hospital, said Sgt. Gary Robertson. No one else was injured.

Gonzalez’s relatives had summoned police to the home because of a family argument involving him, Robertson said.

“Johnny approached the officers with a stick in his hand … and threw the object at the officers, at which time the (two) officers – fearing for the lives – fired at him several times,” Robertson said.

At 5:30 pm, a one block stretch of North San Benito Avenue remained cordoned off just north of Adams Street.
