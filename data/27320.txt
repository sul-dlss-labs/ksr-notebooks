Clinton police have identified the woman who died from injuries in a four-vehicle accident while fleeing from police on Friday.

On Tuesday morning, police identified the woman as 40-year-old Jacklyn "Jackie" Mitchell of Jackson. Mitchell, who was originally listed in critical condition, died and three others were injured in the crash on Highway 80 near Hampstead Boulevard.

The accident happened around 10 a.m. after Mitchell ran a red light at Hampstead Boulevard, authorities said.

Clinton Police Chief Fred Hayman said during a press conference Friday that an officer attempted to make a traffic stop on Highway 80. As the officer approached, Mitchell drove off at a high rate of speed and led police on a chase along the highway.

Mitchell had an "extensive criminal background," that included 16 prior felonies, authorities said. She also had been on active felony probation through the Mississippi Department of Corrections.

Hayman on Friday said the vehicle Mitchell was driving — that included two other men — had been reported stolen out of Jackson days earlier.

The two men riding in the car with Mitchell will not face charges in relation to the incident, according to a news release from the CPD. However, Clinton police will pass their information to the Jackson Police Department to further investigate into the auto theft.

The driver of the car that was hit is recovering from her injuries in the hospital, authorities said.
