A Miami County grand jury cleared three Troy police officers and a county sheriff's deputy in a Dec. 29 early morning shoot out in which Franklin Jones III, 30, of Troy died.

The grand jury met Friday to hear the results of an investigation by the state Bureau of Criminal Investigation into the death of Jones. He was killed after police were called to a report of shots fired in the area of West Franklin and Monroe streets early Dec. 29. The grand jury findings were disclosed Wednesday, Feb. 19.

Police responding to the shots fired found a Troy man with a gunshot wound to the buttocks and a short time later encountered Jones in a nearby alley. A gun battle followed in which Jones was killed and Troy Police Sgt. Jeff Kunkleman injured with a gunshot wound to the calf. He received hospital treatment, as did the man shot in the buttocks.

County Prosecutor Tony Kendell said the death was a, "suicide by cop." Prior to his encounter with police, Jones showed up at an aquaintance's door, armed with a handgun, and said he "was going out" that night, Kendell said.

The BCI report said the investigation showed, "When Jones was seen by officers, Jones already had his weapon in a ready position and fired his weapon at police officers. Jones injured one officer before other officers were able to return fire." Jones and the wounded man had been in a fight earlier at LeDoux's in downtown Troy over a woman both had dated, the report said.

Kunkleman, along with fellow Troy officers Jared Cole and Jesse Canan and sheriff's deputy Will Roberts, all were placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Roberts returned to work Monday, sheriff's Chief Deputy Dave Duchak said. The Troy officers also are returning to work.

The officers, Kendell said, "responded and reacted in accordance with their training."
