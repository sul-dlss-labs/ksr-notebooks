DOVER â€” Morris County authorities are investigating the death of a town man found hanging in his jail cell four hours after turning himself in on stabbing charges, authorities said.

Diego Munoz-Colon, 46, turned himself in at police headquarters about 7:30 a.m. Thursday and was placed in a holding cell, which is monitored through a video feed by a staff member at the front desk, said Morris County Prosecutor Robert A. Bianchi.

At 11:50 a.m., a police officer brought lunch to Munoz-Colon and found him hanging by his shirt inside the cell, said Bianchi.

Munoz-Colon was taken to Saint Clare's Hospital in Dover where he was pronounced dead.

Munoz-Colon is believed to have been in the cell alone, and there is no indication of foul play, suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement, Bianchi said. The state Attorney General's Office has been notified, he said.

The major crime unit of the prosecutor's office, the county sheriff and the Medical Examiner's Office are jointly conducting the investigation.
