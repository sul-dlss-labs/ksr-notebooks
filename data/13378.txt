A 107-year-old man was killed Saturday in Arkansas after shooting at SWAT officers.

KATV reports that officers responded to the home of Monroe Isadore on a domestic disturbance call.

When police arrived around 4:30 p.m., Isadore allegedly pointed a gun at them before shooting through the door after officers announced themselves. No one was hit, and the police retreated back before calling in additional help, according to Arkansas Matters.

Negotiations with the elderly man began as a SWAT team managed to insert a camera into the home to confirm that Isadore had a handgun.

SWAT then released gas into the room, which police say caused Isadore to fire at officers. A SWAT entry team entered the room where, Isadore allegedly continued to shoot. Officers fired back, killing him.
