ANDERSON, SC (WCSC) - Investigators say an alleged carjacker attempted to ambush officers before he was fatally shot by law enforcement.



Anderson County Deputy Coroner Charlie Boseman said 34-year-old Casey Nicholas Smith died Sunday morning at the Southerner Motor Lodge on Williamston Road.



Sheriff John Skipper said Smith was wanted on charges of kidnapping, armed robbery and possession of a weapon during a violent crime.



Deputies had been searching for Smith after investigators say he robbed a taxi driver on Clemson Boulevard and forced him to drive him to Greenville County. Investigators said Smith committed a similar crime against another cab driver to return to Anderson County.



Authorities said a stolen Dodge Ram pickup outside the Southerner Motor Lodge led Anderson County deputies to the motel Sunday morning.



Lt. Tony Tilley, with the Anderson Police Department, said his officers were called to assist around 7:15 a.m.



Tilley said deputies and police went to the door closest to the stolen vehicle. After knocking on the door, two people came outside and told the law officers that the man they wanted was under the bed, Tilley said.



Tilley said deputies and police asked Smith to come outside, but Smith refused. Tilley said that a short time later, the officers heard gunfire.



Tilley said the deputies and police convinced Smith to surrender a weapon before they entered the room. Smith told the law officers that he had shot himself and was hurt.



Tilley said the officers were lifting up the bed when Smith shot at them with another gun he had. Four deputies and two police officers fired back, Tilley said.
