SORRENTO — A Leesburg man who injured a deputy during a chase Wednesday morning died hours later at the hospital following a “medical episode,” authorities say.

AdventHealth Waterman staff declared 27-year old Sean Christopher Bentley dead shortly before noon Wednesday. The Lake County Sheriff's Office said he was taken there after suffering an undisclosed medical emergency and passing out as he was being treated by EMS.

Deputies were pursuing Bentley on a warrant for failing to appear in court for previous charges of eluding law enforcement. When a deputy confronted him in the morning, Bentley ran to his car, the Sheriff's Office said. The deputy attempted to pull Bentley out of the car after using his taser, but Bentley reportedly put the car in drive and dragged the deputy some distance, injuring his leg.

Not long later, he crashed his car on County Road 437 while being pursued by another deputy. Florida Highway Patrol reported he rear-ended one vehicle and struck a trailer being pulled the opposite direction by a pickup truck. No one was reported injured in the crash. Bentley attempted to flee on foot right after the crash, but Lt. John Herrell, spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office, said he surrendered to deputies' commands to stop in the area of the Eagle Dunes subdivision in Sorrento.

According to Herrell, Bentley began showing signs of a medical emergency a short while later, and EMS was called to the scene. Bentley was aggressive with EMS personnel, deputies reported, and eventually he passed out and was taken to the hospital.

The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating Bentley’s crash and the Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating Bentley’s death, which is standard procedure when a suspect dies.
