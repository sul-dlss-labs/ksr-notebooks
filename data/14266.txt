The body of a man who jumped off the Market Street Bridge to avoid arrested was recovered from the Sacramento River Monday afternoon, officials have confirmed.

Shasta County's Coroner's Office today identified the man as Darryl Brice Cunningham, 48, of Redding. Police were pursuing Cunningham in connection with a domestic violence case when he jumped into the river. He was last seen March 29 as he struggled to swim and sank below the surface.

Fisherman found his body just before 1 p.m. yesterday near the Sundail Bridge. The body, submerged 3-4 feet, appeared to have been in the water for several days to a week, Shasta County Sheriff's Lt. Eric Magrini said.

"It looks like he's been in the water for quite some time, so I'm hesitant to give race or any other descriptors at this time," Magrini said at the scene. "There was some algae on the clothing so it's even hard to determine color of clothing."

Authorities said there was a strong possibility that it was Cunningham, but could not confirm that until an autopsy by the coroner was completed today.

Because of the rain and muddy river conditions, the sheriff's Boating Safety Unit's divers were unable to continue their search last month. But sheriff's deputies had been scouting the banks along the river where Cunningham was last seen.

Magrini estimated the site where the body was pulled from is about a quarter of a mile downstream from the Market Street Bridge.

Redding police officers cordoned off access to the river near the Redding Posse rodeo grounds and a Sheriff's Office dive boat and crew were brought in to search in the river near the bridge.
