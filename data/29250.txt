Two people died and a third was injured in a two-vehicle fiery crash after a police chase on U.S. Highway 29 in Wellford Wednesday evening.

The crash happened at about 5:16 p.m. near Locust Street in Wellford, according to the S.C. Highway Patrol.

Pronounced dead at the scene were Charles Rickman Stepp, 61, of Saint Helena Court in Roebuck; and Kenneth James Heavner of Kensington Drive in Taylors, according Spartanburg County Coroner Rusty Clevenger.

Clevenger said forensic exams and toxicology reports are pending.

A 2017 Dodge Charger was southbound on U.S. 29 attempting to elude police when it struck a 2007 Jeep Commander that was pulling out of a private driveway onto the highway, according to Trooper Matt Southern.

Both vehicles caught fire from the impact, he said. The highway remained closed into the night at the accident scene.

The driver of the Charger was not wearing a seat belt and was ejected. The driver, who was not identified, was taken to Spartanburg Medical Center with unknown injuries.

A passenger in that car, identified by the coroner as Heavner, also was not wearing a seat belt, was ejected and was fatally injured, the trooper said.

The driver of the Jeep, identified by the coroner as Stepp, was also ejected and fatally injured. It was not known if he wearing a seat belt.

Multiple news outlets reported Wellford Police Chief David Green saying the crash followed a high-speed police pursuit that started as pursuit of a reckless driver on Interstate 85 near the Highway 290 exit in Duncan.

Green reportedly said Wellford police assisted Duncan police in the chase before backing off, prior to the crash.

Neither Green nor the Duncan Police Department could be immediately reached Thursday.

Trooper Joel Hovis said said the Highway Patrol's Multidisciplinary Accident Investigation Team is investigating the crash.
