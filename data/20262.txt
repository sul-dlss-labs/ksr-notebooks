Authorities say a woman has died after being struck by a Las Vegas police car while walking near a casino.

The crash happened just before 9 p.m. Saturday near the Sam's Town hotel-casino in the southeastern part of the city.

The woman suffered life-threatening injuries and was taken to the hospital, where she later died.

The Clark County coroner's office confirmed the death but isn't yet releasing her identity.

Police haven't released information about the crash involving their marked squad car.

It was the second fatal crash in the area at the time.

Police say in the other, separate crash, a woman in a wheelchair was fatally struck by a Dodge Durango SUV.

The driver stayed on scene.

The second victim also hasn't been identified.
