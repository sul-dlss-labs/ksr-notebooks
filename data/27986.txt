LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — Metro Police say a man committed suicide after he escaped house arrest the morning of May 4. The incident occurred in the 1900 block of Fremont Street.

Metro’s Major Violators Section responded to reports of the escapee, who they note was wanted for numerous weapons-related felony warrants.

Detectives arrived on scene around 9:42 a.m., set up a perimeter and knocked on the door of an apartment. After police identified themselves and ordered him to exit, the suspect escaped through a rear window in the apartment.

When he exited, the suspect made contact with detectives, and they chased him on foot.

Pursuing officers then heard gunfire and found the suspect in an alley, dead from an apparent gunshot wound to the head.

According to a news release, Metro detectives did not make physical contact with or use force against the suspect before he committed suicide.

The suspect’s identification and cause and manner of death will be released by the Clark County Coroner at a later time.
