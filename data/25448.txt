There is an active investigation into an incident where a man reportedly shot himself at the Bloomfield Police precinct on Tuesday evening.

Bloomfield Police has not released many details on the incident, but according to the family of the man, they identified him as Mr. Pat Montella -who was a retired Newark Police Lieutenant- said the conflict initiated as a domestic incident where Patrick and his wife were removed from a Bloomfield residence after a dispute.

According to a statement one of the family members publicly released, Lt. Montella was out having dinner with his wife who is an active Newark Police officer and began to confront her about a lengthy investigation involving their relationship.

The couple then left the restaurant where police were called to an unidentified location and arrested both of them for the domestic violence incident according to the Lt. Patrick Montello's family member.
