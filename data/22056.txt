A 32-year-old Fairfax County man who was in psychiatric distress died early Friday after he was jolted with a Taser charge by an Arlington County officer trying to subdue him inside an apartment where the man was visiting relatives, police said.

It was the second death in a police Taser incident in Arlington this year, coming after a January case in which a District man died shortly after county police used a Taser on him at the Pentagon City Metro platform. A final medical examiner's report is pending in the earlier death, police said.

Police and medics called to the 5500 block of Columbia Pike at 12:41 a.m. found Adil Jouamai naked and uncooperative, police said. Jouamai was combative and ignored officers' commands, they said. An officer deployed a Taser to bring him under control, and shortly after, Jouamai did not appear to be breathing, said Lt. William Griffith, an Arlington police spokesman.

Medics tried to resuscitate Jouamai and took him to Virginia Hospital Center, where he was pronounced dead.

"This is a very unfortunate incident and we are certainly taking this loss of life very seriously," Arlington Police Chief M. Douglas Scott said in a statement. The internal affairs and the homicide-robbery divisions are investigating the incident, Griffith said.

The officer who deployed the Taser remains on active duty, but could be placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

The incident was the fourth time this year that Arlington police have deployed Tasers. . Two of those confrontations did not involve death or injury, Griffith said.

But on Jan. 17, a 36-year-old District man died after being Tasered during a confrontation with police on the Pentagon City Metro platform.

William R. Bumbrey III died after an officer questioned him about a pharmacy theft and used a Taser on him during a struggle, police said.
