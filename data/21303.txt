A 68-year-old woman is hospitalized in critical condition after being stabbed by her son, who also stabbed her husband to death before an Oakland County sheriff's deputy fatally shot him.

The sheriff's department says 40-year-old Holden Wong killed 74-year-old Kwong Wong and wounded Mi Mi Wong at the family's Rochester Hills apartment Saturday.

Undersheriff Mike McCabe says deputies found the parents bleeding people on the floor, with their son standing a few feet away holding a knife.

McCabe says one deputy then shot and killed the son.

Teresa Rodger at POH Regional Medical Center in Pontiac says Mi Mi Wong was in critical condition Monday afternoon.
