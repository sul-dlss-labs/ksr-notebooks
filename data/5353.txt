A fugitive wanted in the shooting of a police officer was shot and killed Thursday afternoon as he tried to avoid capture, authorities said.

It was not immediately clear whether Joaquin Maltos Figueroa, 25, was armed during the confrontation with Fresno police, said Chief Jerry Dyer. The suspect had been sought in Monday’s shooting of Officer Brian Nieto during a traffic stop.

Figueroa also was a “person of interest” in the case of Debbie Hawk, a mother of three who disappeared in June and is presumed dead.
