(Columbia-AP) Jan. 5, 2006 - A South Carolina sheriff's deputy on Wednesday was charged with

while attempting to serve him an arrest warrant for grand larceny.

41-yera-old Darlington County sheriff's investigator Tim Robertson was charged with voluntary manslaughter in the death of 45-year-old William E. Sheffield on December 29th.

Sheffield, of Society Hill, bled to death from four gunshot wounds, according to an incident report.

"The rule of the law prohibits any officer from shooting a fleeing suspect ... four times," prosecutor Jay Hodge told the Florence Morning News.

Robertson will remain on administrative leave until his trial, Darlington County Lt. John Purvis.

"He's a good officer," Purvis said. "No problems ever."

Sheffield has previous convictions for assault and battery with intent to kill, assault with a deadly weapon, drug possession, and discharge of a firearm into a dwelling.
