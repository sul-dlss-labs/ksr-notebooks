MILLINGTON, Md. (AP) -- The Maryland State Police says an erratic driver who refused to stop for police in Delaware is dead after he apparently lost control of his car and crashed into a vacant house in Maryland's Kent County.

Authorities say an officer from the Clayton Police Department attempted to stop the driver of a 2004 Saturn SUV in Delaware early Saturday after he was seen driving erratically. The officer believed the driver may have been operating under the influence, but the driver refused to stop. Police followed the vehicle into Kent County where the driver ran off the road, hit a curb and then a utility pole and then struck the house in Millington.

Maryland State Police identified the driver as Adam M. Hughes, 25, of Clayton, Del.

An investigation is ongoing.
