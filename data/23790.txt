HERNANDO, Fla. -- The Citrus County Sheriff’s Office is investigating a deadly deputy-involved shooting.

Deputies initially responded to the area of Xstream Games 3 at 2780 North Florida in Hernando around 5:00 p.m. Saturday.

Authorities were told 28-year-old Ryan Batchelder threatened to shoot someone in that business.

Deputies located Batchelder in his car and pursued his vehicle but ended the chase at FL-200 due to high speeds and heavy traffic. A short time later he was spotted speeding down southbound U.S. 41 heading towards Xstream Games 3.

As he passed the store, deputies say Batchelder pointed his gun at them. Deputies attempted to stop him.

Batchelder crashed his car into a sheriff’s vehicle and caused the cruiser to hit three other parked cars. The deputy in the accident was transported to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Deputies shot at Batchelder’s vehicle and he was hit with the gunfire. Batchelder died from his injuries.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is taking over the investigation and the deputies involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave with pay.
