LAKE COUNTY, Ohio -- A 45-year-old Tallmadge man who shot himself during a pursuit with Lake County police has died.

A police source told cleveland.com that Adam Shriver died Wednesday at MetroHealth Cleveland Medical Center.

Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner records do not yet say where Shriver shot himself nor his official cause of death.

Shriver crashed his car into a utility pole Tuesday morning on Pelton Road in Willoughby after police tried to stop him, police said. He ran north towards Apollo Parkway and shot himself while investigators tried to talk to him.

Prior to the pursuit, police said Shriver barged into his ex-girlfriend’s home and fired a gun. No one was hurt in that earlier shooting.
