Authorities have identified the man who was killed after police said he speeding and crashed his car in Sutton.

James L. Drake, 54, of 4 Amesbury St. in Worcester, was the man killed in the crash, according to the office of Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr.

Sutton police said that a pickup truck went speeding by an officer conducting speed monitoring on Whitins Road Monday morning.

The truck was going 50 miles per hour in a 30 mile per hour zone, according to police.

The officer turned on his emergency lights and drove after the pickup truck to pull the driver over. But the pickup truck "accelerated rapidly and created substantial distance" from the cruiser, police said.

The pickup truck got about one mile own the road before rounding a sharp turn and crashing into two other cars.

A 16-year-old Douglas girl and a 55-year-old Douglas woman were driving the two cars struck by the pickup truck. Both sustained minor injuries and sought medical treatment on their own, police said.
