A 34-year-old man who was fatally shot by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies after a violent rampage in Florence was known as Gilberto Garcia and Gustavo Roman, authorities said Tuesday.

“He apparently used the Roman name in the United States, but we are still unsure of where he originated from,” said Lt. Ray Peavy of the Sheriff’s Department.

The man entered a church in the 600 block of Compton Avenue about 11:45 a.m. Monday and took off his clothes. A minister persuaded him to put them back on, authorities said.

The man then left, crossed the street and began smashing the windows of a mortuary. He then attacked a bystander with a hammer, injuring him slightly, and broke into a car. Authorities said he was fatally shot when he drove the car toward officers.

Peavy said investigators are trying to determine whether the man had a history of substance abuse or mental illness.
