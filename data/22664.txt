A 21-year-old man who led state police on a chase was killed when the vehicle he was driving overturned several times in Chesapeake.

State police Sgt. D.S. Carr said a trooper attempted to stop Jelani Adom Green, who was traveling 75 mph in a 55-mph zone on Interstate 64, 2.7 miles east of Deep Creek Boulevard, on Friday at 3:22 a.m.

Green did not stop and instead sped up the 2000 Ford Excursion, which had three passengers. The sport utility vehicle had been stolen in York County on June 16, Carr said.

The trooper began pursuing. Green exceeded 100 mph, Carr said. Green passed a construction area, and a trooper stationed there joined the pursuit; so did a third trooper.

About two minutes and nearly 3 miles into the pursuit, Green tried to maneuver the SUV out of a rolling police road block by driving through the median. The vehicle overturned, crossed into the westbound lanes and overturned again and landed in a wooded area, Carr said.

Green, who was not wearing a seat belt, died on the scene. The three passengers were taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, Carr said. Their condition was not available yesterday.

Police had difficulty establishing Green's identity, Carr said. His residence is unknown because Green, who had an extensive criminal record, had given several fictitious addresses, Carr said. His parents live in New York City, he added.

State police also reported two other road fatalities, bringing Virginia's 2007 highway death toll to 459 yesterday, compared with 434 as of the same date last year.
