A minor was killed in a car crash during a police chase Monday night.

The Wilmington Police Department initiated a traffic stop on a stolen vehicle at 7:22 p.m. Monday at South 16th and Castle Streets, according to a Tuesday afternoon Wilmington police news release.

The suspect fled from officers and didnâ€™t stop at the red light at South 13th and Wooster Streets, the release said. The officers stopped at that light and waited until traffic was clear before pursuing the car.

Officers were a block behind the vehicle when the driver ran the next red light, according to the release. At South 13th and Dawson Streets, the car crashed into the driver's side of a flatbed tow truck, causing the truck to spin around.

The entire police chase lasted through six blocks and 45 seconds, the release said. Officers pulled the driver of the car out and immediately performed CPR until EMS arrived on scene. The driver of the car, who was a juvenile, died from injuries sustained during the crash after being transported to New Hanover Regional Medical Center, according to the release. The passenger of the car, who also is a juvenile, was transported to the hospital as well but with non-life-threatening injuries.
