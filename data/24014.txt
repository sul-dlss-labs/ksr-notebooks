The body of a man from southwest Missouri who allegedly tried to evade a Seneca police officer by swimming across Shoal Creek was recovered Monday.

Matthew Putnam, 43, of Joplin, was pulled from the water by dive teams.

Newton County Sheriff Chris Jennings said the officer attempted to initiate a car stop in Seneca, but when the driver failed to stop, a pursuit took place.

The pursuit continued up the west side of Newton County, along the state line, and ended when the man drove the vehicle into Shoal Creek.

In a news release, Jennings said the man exited the vehicle and was standing in shallow water.

Law enforcement at the scene included Seneca police, Newton County deputies and Missouri State Highway Patrol troopers.

According to Jennings, the officers told Putnam to come out of the water and he said "no" and started walking west in the water.

He said the officers kept an eye on the man, who at one point began yelling for help and disappeared under the water.

Jennings said divers from Newton County and Redings Mill Fire Protection District were contacted as soon as Putnam refused to exit the water. The divers recovered his body a short time later.

The highway patrol will investigate the drowning.

According to the release, Putnam lived near the creek. His body was transported to a funeral home.

The Newton County Coroner has scheduled an autopsy for Putnam.
