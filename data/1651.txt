The film crew for “Tricks of a Woman,” previously seen at Accent Limo in Milford, is shooting scenes at Southwick’s Zoo today.

The independent film, a romantic comedy about a photographer who makes a bet that he can turn a waitress into a fashion model, stars Scott Elrod of “Men in Trees,” Carlos Leon of “Law and Order” and Vincent Pastore of “The Sopranos.” Elrod and Leon were scheduled to be at the zoo today.

Much of the filming takes place in the modeling world, said director Todd Norwood.

“It’s been really fantastic here,” Norwood said. “It’s a nice change of pace.”

The crew planned on shooting a first date scene, near the rhino area, between Elrod’s character and the waitress, played by Elika Trifonova, who is also an executive producer of the film.

“This is where he shows his non-superficial side - when she kind of starts falling for him,” Norwood said.

Visitors enjoy the different action and some may even want to be part of the show, said Betsey Brewer, one of the zoo directors.

“Everyone wants to see them filming a movie,” Brewer said.
