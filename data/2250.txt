(Kenner-AP) -- A 74-year-old man pushing a shopping cart darted into a four-lane highway in the middle of a block, and was hit and killed by a marked Kenner police car. Hudson Ordeneaux of Kenner died at the scene earlier this morning.

Police say the officer, whose name was not released, was not injured. Captain Steve Caraway says a witness told investigators that the police officer tried unsuccessfully to swerve out of the man's path. Ordeneaux lived with his wife only a few blocks from the scene of the accident.
