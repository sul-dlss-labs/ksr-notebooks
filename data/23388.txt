SELLS, AZ (Tucson News Now) - A man was shot and killed Tuesday night after a reported altercation with the United States Border Patrol.

It happened along State Route 86 around 8 p.m. Tuesday, about 15 miles west of Sells on the Tohono O'odham Reservation.

In a written statement Supervisory Border Patrol Agent Steven Passement said, "Initial reports are that a Border Patrol agent shot and killed a man who was assaulting another Border Patrol agent near Sells, Arizona."

It's unclear if the man was an illegal border crosser, officials say; though the area where the shooting occurred is notorious for human smuggling and drug trafficking.

Agent Passement went on to say, "Customs and Border Protection regrets the loss of life and will fully cooperate with the investigation led by the Tohono O'odham Police Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation."

Neither tribal police nor the FBI would provide any additional comment on the case, only that their collaborative investigation is ongoing.
