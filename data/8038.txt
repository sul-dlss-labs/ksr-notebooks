MOBILE, Ala. -- A suspected sex abuser shot himself in the head today after police officers arrived at his west Mobile residence to arrest him.

Donald Clark Brooks, 50, was hiding outside his Wakulla Drive home when officers arrived to arrest him on 10 different charges ranging from first-degree sexual abuse to first-degree sodomy, said police spokesman Christopher Levy. Brooks shot himself with a revolver before they could take him into custody, the spokesman said.

Levy said Brooks was taken by helicopter to the University of South Alabama Medical Center but later died from the wound to his head.
