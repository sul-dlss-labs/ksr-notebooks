Two people were killed in a crash Wednesday night after a police chase involving a stolen vehicle, Amarillo Police Department Sgt. Jeff Hooten said. The investigation into the crash was hampered by severe weather Wednesday evening and police released more information Thursday morning.

Police said about 8:44 p.m., a man who recognized his stolen Dodge pickup near Amarillo Boulevard and North Bonham Street flagged down a police officer to report the sighting.

The officer found the truck not long after the report but the truck's driver, Nick Gonzales, 42, allegedly picked up speed and tried to allude officials, police said.

Officials said the police initially gave chase, but when Gonzales reached dangerous speeds and displayed reckless driving, the officer backed off and stopped at the 700 block of North Van Buren Street. The officer continued to watch the truck when the truck's tail lights disappeared.

Police continued south to investigate and discovered the truck had crashed into two empty semi-trailers at the 100 block of North Van Buren. Gonzales and his passenger, Joachim Adam Gonzales, 31, both died at the scene from injuries suffered in the accident, officials said.

Police said speed was a contributing factor in the crash, but are uncertain whether or not drugs or alcohol were involved.

Potter County Justice of the Peace Nancy Bosquez ordered autopsies for both men.

The Amarillo Police Department's Traffic Investigation Squad is investigating the incident.
