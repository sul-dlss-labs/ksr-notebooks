Richard Dale, a 54-year-old white man, was killed in an officer-involved shooting Saturday, April 19. According to Torrance police spokesman Dave Crespin, officers responded to a complaint of loud music in the 2200 block of Torrance Boulevard in Torrance about 12: 45 a.m., but when they arrived the music had been turned off.

A few minutes later, officers responded to a second complaint of loud music. According to Crespin, officers were making their way to an upstairs apartment when they were confronted by Dale, who allegedly pointed a handgun at them. Shots were fired and Dale was killed.

According to a coroner's report, Dale was shot multiple times in the chest. His time of death was listed as 1:52 a.m. by paramedics with the Torrance Fire Department.

A handgun was recovered at the scene, police said. Police also recovered "numerous weapons and ammunition" inside Dale's home.
