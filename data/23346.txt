MARTINSBURG, W.Va. â€” The U.S. Marshals Service Mountain State Fugitive Task Force was involved in a "line-of-duty" fatal shooting Thursday near Hedgesville, W.Va., Deputy U.S. Marshal Cole Barnhart said in a statement.

The deceased was not identified by Barnhart, who said in a brief interview Thursday afternoon that no law enforcement officers were injured during the incident.

The shooting occurred while the agency was attempting to arrest a suspect with a warrant that had been obtained by the West Virginia State Police for armed robbery charges, Barnhart said.

The West Virginia State Police Bureau of Criminal Investigation is the lead investigative agency of the police-involved shooting, Barnhart said.

The U.S. Marshals Service will also conduct an internal review after the state police completes its investigation, Barnhart said.

Barnhart said the agency, as a matter of policy, does not release the names of deputy marshals involved in shooting incidents until the conclusion of all investigations.
