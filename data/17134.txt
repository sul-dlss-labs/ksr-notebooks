An Etowah County grand jury this week returned no charges against a Rainbow City police officer involved in a fatal shooting in January.

Etowah County District Attorney Jody Willoughby said the grand jury took no action against Rainbow City police officer Richard Roberts in the shooting death of Joshua Tate Fielding on Jan. 17.

The incident began about 11:30 a.m. at Dogwood Trace Apartments off Christopher Street, police said at the time. Police responding to a disturbance found a man armed with a handgun. After an altercation and a brief foot pursuit, the man, Fielding, was shot dead.

The State Bureau of Investigation carried out an investigation into the incident. Willoughby said evidence was presented and witnesses testified this week.

"As a result of no findings in this case, the members of the grand jury confirmed the officer followed procedures concerning deadly physical force," he said.
