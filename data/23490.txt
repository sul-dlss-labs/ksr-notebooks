CINNAMINSON -- An investigation is underway after a stolen car slammed into the back of a tractor trailer Wednesday, killing a passenger, the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

Police attempted to stop the BMW which had been reported stolen in Cinnaminson, around 10:30 a.m. Instead of pulling over, however, the driver took off at a high rate of speed southbound on Rt. 130 before crashing into the truck near Riverton Road moments later, according to authorities.

Authorities declined to release the name of the passenger, a woman, pending notification of next-of-kin. The male driver, identified as a 17-year-old, was admitted to Cooper University Hospital in Camden in critical condition. The driver of the tractor trailer was unhurt.
