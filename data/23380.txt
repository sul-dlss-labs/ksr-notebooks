Topeka police have determined that an incident Monday in which two people died was a murder-suicide.

Authorities said Tuesday that Tabitha Krystofosky, 27, was shot and killed by her husband John Krystofosky, 27, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot.

Tabitha Krystofosky’s death marks the 29th homicide of the year in Topeka, making it the deadliest year on record for homicides. Topeka’s previous homicide record of 28 victims was set in 1994.

The couple had been estranged, Topeka police Lt. Colleen Stuart said in a news release.

Police responded to a domestic disturbance at about 10:50 a.m. Monday at 1190 S.W. High.

Upon arrival, they observed two people inside, one of whom had a gun. As they notified dispatch, they heard gunshots and reported that officers were in danger.

Additional agencies and officers arrived, however attempts to contact the occupants were unsuccessful. Negotiators were also called to the scene of the standoff and a perimeter was established. The Response Team later observed two people down inside the residence.

Medical personnel entered and pronounced both individuals deceased, Stuart said.
