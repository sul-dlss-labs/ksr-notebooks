SYLVANIA TWP., Ohio (WTVG) - A man died following an officer-involved shooting Sunday morning in Sylvania Township. The man was unarmed but told police he had a gun, according to Sylvania Township Police Chief Paul Long.

An officer with the Sylvania Township Police Department responded to a call for a home burglary just before 5 a.m on Whiteford Road near Rudgate. Police found a suspect near the home, and he did not follow the officer’s directions, according to a press release from the police department.

The suspect ran away and allegedly reached into his waistband, turned toward police, and “raised his arm in a threatening manner,” according to the statement. During a press conference Sunday morning, officials said the suspect yelled that he had a gun. That’s when an officer shot the suspect multiple times, striking him in the legs and face.

The suspect was taken to the hospital and was later pronounced dead. Police are not yet identifying him but did say he was a Hispanic male in his 20s.

The Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation is handling the investigation. Sylvania Township is not equipped with body cameras to provide any footage of the incident.

The involved officer was identified as Kyle Andrews, an 8-year veteran of law enforcement. He has been with the Sylvania Township Police Department for 2 years. Officer Andrews is on paid administrative leave following the incident.

“For the officer, it’s what he perceives and what he knows and the facts he knows. We don’t have to wait for someone to shoot at us because the bottom line is if they shoot first, maybe we’re never shooting back,” Chief Paul Long said. “Unfortunately that’s happened across the country, it’s happened here locally with two Toledo officers in the last year.”
