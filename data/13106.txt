A Grady County man was killed in a single car accident over the weekend while allegedly fleeing from a sheriff’s deputy here.

James Dustin Trawick was driving a 1991 Toyota Corolla when the accident happened at the intersection of Lewis Road and Midway Road around 3:55 a.m., Sunday, according to the Georgia State Patrol.

The GSP reports that Trawick was being pursued by a Grady County Sheriff’s Deputy at the time of the accident.

Grady County Sheriff Harry Young says Cpl. Jeff Riggins was the officer attempting to stop Trawick. Young says speeds reached near 90 mph when Riggins realized a tire on Trawick’s car was beginning to come off the vehicle.

“He was holding back a little bit to give distance between the two vehicles for safety” the sheriff says of Riggins and then the wreck happened.

According to the GSP, the Corolla failed to stop at a stop sign at the intersection and crashed into an embankment on the north shoulder of Midway Road before landing in a ditch.

Riggins called for EMS, and attempted to revive Trawick although he could not find a pulse, according to Sheriff Young.

The sheriff says his deputy was professional in his handling of the case and does not think any further investigation into the matter is needed.

He says Riggins had responded to a report of a prowler, a white, shirtless male. While en route to the call, Riggns saw a man matching that description coming from the area where the prowler had been seen. The deputy pursued the car, and the driver initially pulled over, but as Riggins was walking to the suspect’s car, the car drove away. That’s when the final pursuit began that resulted in Trawick’s fatality, the sheriff says.
