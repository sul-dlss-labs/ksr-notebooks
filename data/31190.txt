CLINTON, Miss. (WLBT) - Mississippi Bureau of Investigations is analyzing an officer-involved shooting by a Clinton policeman.

Clinton Police Chief Ford Hayman says the incident happened Friday night after officers attempted to stop a man they believe stole a Ford pickup truck from Jackson and drove into Clinton.

Hayman said the man, who has not been identified, would not stop but instead began to evade police and drive back to Jackson.

During the police pursuit, Hayman says the man rammed into a Clinton police officerâ€™s cruiser and crashed into a gate at the Terrace Point Apartments on McFadden Road in Jackson.

Then, police say the man exited his vehicle looking to start an altercation with an officer.

The police chief said the individual appeared as though he was about to pull out a weapon and was fatally shot.

Mississippi Bureau of Investigations is handling the case.
