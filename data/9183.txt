MONROE, LA (AP) - A postal worker was chased and shot in the downtown area of Monroe, apparently by a man who caused a wreck, fired at police and later died in a ditch off U.S. 165 North.

The chain of events started around 2:15 p.m. Tuesday near the Ouachita Parish School Board office, a few blocks south of the sheriff's office.

The postal worker's name was not released. Authorities told The News-Star that he was shot in the backside and taken to St. Francis Medical Center for treatment. His condition was not immediately available.

Police pursued the suspect, who fired at them as he fled the scene. Ouachita parish Sheriff Royce Toney confirmed the suspect died after he drove into a ditch. His name has not been released.

There's no word on what sparked the shooting.
