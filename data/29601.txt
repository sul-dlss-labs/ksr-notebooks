A police pursuit in Pomona led to a crash that left one person dead on Wednesday, Feb. 3.

Officers attempted to pull over the driver of an Accord at Ninth Street and San Antonio Avenue for failing to stop at a stop sign at about 3:51 p.m., Pomona police spokeswoman Aly Mejia said. The driver took off and was chased by police for several minutes.

Police stopped chasing the suspect before he crashed into another vehicle at San Antonio and Philadelphia Street, according to Mejia.

Rolando Pinto-Mendez, 26, of Pomona, died at the scene, Coroner’s spokeswoman Sarah Ardalani said.

He was the sole occupant of the car that was hit, police said.

The suspect got out of the Accord, stole a girl’s bicycle and fled, Mejia said. Officers surrounded the area and searched for him.

Officers arrested Eli Richard Lopez, 22, of Pomona on suspicion of murder, grand theft auto, hit-and-run causing death or injury and evading police.

The Honda Accord turned out to be stolen.

Lopez remains in custody at the Inmate Reception Center in Los Angeles in lieu of $2 million bail. He is scheduled to appear at Pomona Superior Court on Friday, Feb. 5.
