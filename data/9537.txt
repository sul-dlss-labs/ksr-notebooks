IDA, LA (KSLA)- Arkansas State Police identify a Caddo Parish man shot by a law enforcement official near the Arkansas-Louisiana State line in Miller County, Arkansas, Sunday evening.

Officials with the Arkansas State Police identify the victim as 71-year-old John Morneau of Ida, Louisiana.

Officials report that Arkansas Game and Fish Wildlife Officers and a Miller County Sheriff's Deputy arrived on Morneau's private property in Arkansas in an attempt to service Morneau Miller County District Court warrants.

The warrants were reportedly for 1st degree assault, two incidents of criminal mischief and 2nd degree harassment.

When the officers reportedly came in contact with Morneau, they say Morneau responded to them identifying themselves as law enforcement officers, by allegedly drawing two revolvers and allegedly pointed them at the officers.

Investigators say at least one officer fired at Morneau, hitting him at least once. Morneau was pronounced dead at the scene.

As of Monday, Morneau's body has been taken to the Arkansas State Crime Lab along with other scene evidence for examination.

The Arkansas State Police continue to investigate the tragic incident and plan to submit a report to the Miller County Prosecuting Attorney, who will then determine whether the shooting was justified.
