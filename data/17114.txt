Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey will not file criminal charges against two Denver police officers who shot and killed a man in January outside a west-side hotel.

Detective Kenneth Manzanares and Officer John Mehrtens fired their guns at Ramone Lonergan on Jan. 11 outside the Ramada Denver Midtown Hotel/Super 8 Denver, 2601 Zuni St.

Lonergan was holding a gun and raised it from his chest toward Manzanares, who was ordering him to drop the weapon, according to a decision letter released Thursday by Morrissey.

“That is when Detective Manzanares fired,” the letter said. “The first shot did not affect Mr. Lonergan, so Detective Manzanares fired two more shots.”

Mehrtens told investigators that he fired his gun after seeing Lonergan lunge inside an SUV where a woman was sitting in the passenger seat, according to the letter. Mehrtens said he had heard gunshots and wasn’t sure whether the detective had been hit. He also said he was scared Lonergan would shoot the woman or him.

A surveillance video camera outside the hotel supported the officers’ story, the letter said.

Evidence also showed Lonergan fired one round from a .22-caliber pistol at the police, the letter said.

Four bullets struck Lonergan, hitting him in the head, chest and left forearm.

The officers were at the hotel to investigate a stolen car. While there, they noticed a woman trying to reserve a room with a credit card that had been cut in half.

Police began focusing on her and learned that she was associated with a Toyota Rav 4 in the parking lot. Lonergan was the Toyota’s driver.
