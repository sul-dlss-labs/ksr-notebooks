Police were in a standoff with a person suspected of firing a gun in a northeast Colorado Springs neighborhood Friday evening. According to police, the standoff ended when the suspect took his own life.

Police sent out a "shelter in place" alert for Stetson Hills residents in the area of Shimmer Circle and Autumn Leaf around 5:15 p.m. The area covered a one-block radius. The neighborhood is near Antelope Ridge Drive and Barnes Road. The shelter in place meant residents were told to stay indoors and away from windows.

"This has developed into a situation where we have a barricaded individual inside the house," said Lt. Hugh Velasquez with the Colorado Springs Police Department. "As far as we know, there is only this lone person in the house. This is not a hostage situation. We have a shelter in place order going for the residents in this area and we would advise anyone that need to come into this area to avoid it."

The standoff came to an end sometime after 11 p.m. Police believe the suspect died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. As more details become available this article will be updated.
