PITTSBURG â€” Police on Monday identified an Antioch man as the speeding motorcyclist who was killed in a crash while trying to flee from an officer Friday night.

Motorcyclist Rafael Gonzalez, 28, of Antioch, died after crashing into another vehicle while evading an officer, Pittsburg police Capt. Ron Raman said.

The incident began about 6:20 p.m. Friday when a Pittsburg police officer spotted a motorcyclist speeding eastbound on the Pittsburg/Antioch Highway near Arcy Lane, Raman said. The officer, a 20-year veteran, tried to stop the motorcyclist on suspicion of reckless driving. The motorcyclist sped away, escaping onto southbound Auto Center Drive, Raman said. The officers ended up abandoning the pursuit for safety reasons.

The speeding motorcyclist collided with another vehicle near Highway 4 and Auto Center Drive in Antioch, more than half a mile from where Pittsburg police terminated their pursuit. The motorcyclist died at the scene, and two people in the car suffered minor injuries and were transported to the hospital.
