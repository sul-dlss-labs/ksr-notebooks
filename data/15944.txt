The Phoenix Police Department on Thursday released the identity of the man officers shot and killed on Sunday while responding to an attempted suicide call.

Police officers said they received calls that 51-year-old Ken Cockerel had stabbed himself in the chest at about 6:30 p.m. in a neighborhood near 39th Avenue and Union Hills Drive. When officers arrived, Cockerel had a knife in each hand and, after repeatedly ignoring commands, advanced on two officers, who shot and killed the man, according to officials.

Police say they responded to an incident involving Cockerel an hour earlier at 42nd Avenue and Bell Road, where a female caller identified Cockerel and said he would not leave her alone. The woman was gone by the time police arrived and Cockerel refused to speak to officers before riding away on his motorcycle, police said.

According to police, Phoenix Fire Department personnel pronounced Cockerel dead at the scene and several witnesses said that Cockerel had advanced on officers.
