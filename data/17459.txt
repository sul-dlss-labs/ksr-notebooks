Authorities say the armed Pawtucket, Rhode Island, man shot and killed by a city police officer last week was holding a realistic-looking BB gun.



Police tell The Providence Journal that Officer Julianne Borsari approached 24-year-old Dominique Silva on Thursday while investigating reports of an armed robbery.



Sgt. Paul Brandley says Borsari chased the fleeing Silva and ordered him to drop his weapon, then opened fire when Silva pointed the gun at her.



It's unclear whether Silva fired the BB gun.



Borsari is currently on administrative leave. State and local police and the attorney general's office are investigating whether the use of deadly force was justified.
