GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. (AP) - Police say a man shot and killed by an officer in a Colorado trailer park was holding children hostage with knives.

The Daily Sentinel reports that Grand Junction Police Chief John Camper says 44-year-old Simon Gomez was killed by Cpl. Ryan Piotrowski on Sunday after unsuccessful negotiation attempts.

Gomez' wife called 911 and said he was paranoid and might hurt her 9-year-old girl and 6-year-old boy. Camper says Gomez was shot after he refused to remove knives from the children's throats.

Camper says he believes Piotrowski fired between four and six shots at Gomez.

Gomez tested positive for alcohol and methamphetamine. Camper says Gomez also had a lengthy record with law enforcement.
