Just after midnight on Friday, officers responded to a 911 domestic dispute call at 4592 North Landing Drive in Northeast Cobb. An adult man was armed with a “large hunting-type knife,” and Cobb County Police said that at some point he presented a threat to the officers, and they shot and killed him.

No officers or other residents at the home were injured. The matter is now being handled by the Georgia Bureau of Investigations.
