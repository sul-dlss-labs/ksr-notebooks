Joliet police are conducting an internal investigation into a weekend shooting in which an officer killed a man who allegedly was threatening his ex-girlfriend with a knife, officials said Monday.

Carlos Diaz, 42, of Joliet died of gunshot wounds Friday, according to the Will County coroner's office. He was shot in the 600 block of Columbia Street after police responded to a domestic disturbance, officials said.

Diaz allegedly dragged his former girlfriend out of the home they had shared until last week, police said. He was holding a knife to the woman's throat and threatening to kill her when the officer fired at him, police said.

The officer, who has worked for the department for 11 years, is on administrative leave pending the results of the internal investigation, which is standard procedure, police said.

The officer initially responded to a home in the 600 block of Garnsey Avenue about 3:10 p.m. Friday after a 31-year-old woman called to report her ex-boyfriend had broken several windows.

Diaz was not there when the officer arrived, but he returned about a half-hour later while the officer was down the block completing a police report.

Diaz forced his way into a bathroom where his ex-girlfriend was hiding and dragged her out of the house, police said.

Several of her children were home at the time and witnessed the incident.

The woman fled Diaz and ran to Columbia Street, where he caught up with her and cut her face, police said.

The officer confronted Diaz and told him to drop the knife, before shooting him, police said. Diaz was pronounced dead at 5:32 p.m., officials said.

"The officer used deadly force to save the victim's life," said a statement by Joliet police.

Police responded to the same address last June and arrested Diaz for domestic battery, said Cmdr. Benjamin Billups. Diaz apparently was not convicted on that charge, Billups said.
