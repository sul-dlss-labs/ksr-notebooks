Two Opelika police officers were wounded and a gunman killed early today during a domestic disturbance investigation. The shootings occurred about 1:27 a.m. at a residence on Third Avenue. Opelika Police Chief Tommy Mangham said Raymond Robison fired a shotgun, hitting Police Lt. Terry McMenamin in the face and Officer Brantley Cargill on the top of the head. Mangham said Robison was killed by officers who returned fire. Police were questioning Robison's wife, Terri Robison, on the porch when Robison came out with the shotgun. Cargill was treated at a hospital for a minor wound and released. McMenamin underwent surgery, but because of new federal privacy laws, Mangham said he could not release the officer's condition. It was the second fatal police shooting in Opelika this year. Ronald Greer of Opelika was shot by Opelika police officer Michael Pink June Third after an altercation during which Greer shot and killed his wife at the Royal Federal Credit Union.
