A 36-year-old Oregon man died when his 1998 Oldsmobile rear-ended a freight truck after leading two troopers on a high-speed chase from Kalama to La Center on Interstate 5 early Saturday, the Washington State Patrol reported.

Russell Buckman, 36, of West Linn sped past a state patrol trooper near the Kalama River Road exit at 1:50 a.m. and refused to pull over after the trooper activated his lights and siren, state patrol spokesman Steve Schatzel said.

A second trooper joined the chase south of Woodland, and the speed reached 100 miles per hour, Schatzel said.

Just south of the La Center exit, Buckman slammed into the truck in the center lane and died on impact.

Troopers don’t know why Buckman tried to flee, Schatzel said. “At this point, it’s a mystery why he did what he did.”

The truck driver, Ricky Corbitt, 53, of Clackamas, Ore., was not injured.

A highway lane was closed briefly before Corbitt drove the truck to the side of the road with the Oldsmobile entangled in it.
