LAKEWOOD, Colo. — Lakewood police said an officer-involved shooting happened about 5:30 p.m. Thursday in the 2400 block of Youngfield Street.

John Romero, a spokesperson for the Lakewood Police Department (LPD), said no officers were hurt in the incident.

Just after 3:15 p.m., LPD received a call for a criminal mischief incident at a duplex on Youngfield Street, police said. Agents tried to contact the suspect for several hours – the suspect was inside the home and wouldn’t come out.

At about 5:30 p.m., agents reported seeing fire and smoke in the home. After entering the home, agents said the suspect was armed with a weapon and began to advance toward them. That's when an agent fired at the suspect.

The 47-year-old suspect, identified Friday as Jason Elliot Waterhouse, was taken to a local hospital and later pronounced dead, according to an LPD news release.

Ten Lakewood agents were treated for smoke inhalation as a result of the fire.

Jeffco Critical incident response team is investigating the shooting. West Metro Fire is also investigating, police said.

Officials don’t know how the fire was started. The cause is still under investigation.

Police said it's unclear if the suspect lived at the home where the incident happened.
