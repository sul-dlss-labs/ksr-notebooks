JASPER COUNTY, SC--A Jasper County man died in a patrol car after being arrested for criminal domestic violence.



It happened Sunday night when deputies arrested 53-year-old Steven Horton at his Hardeeville home after they say he brandished two guns in his yard and was making threats.

But when they tried to book him, the jail requested deputies take him to a physician because he was intoxicated and was carrying numerous medications.



The trouble started when deputies were bringing him to the doctor.

"They noticed he was slumped over and they wanted to check him so they got out of the car, checked him and found out he wasn't breathing so they took him back out, started CPR immediately," said Sheriff Allen Wooten.

EMS responded but Horton died at the hospital.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating as part of protocol.
