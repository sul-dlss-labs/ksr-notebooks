A teen who stole a car, crashed it into a creek and raised a gun at authorities before he was shot and killed by police has been identified.

On Sunday, the Dallas Police Department said the medical examiner confirmed the identity of the teen as 17-year-old Jesse Carillo.



Carillo was shot and killed early Friday after a car chase ended in a crash and he got out with a weapon, Dallas Chief of Police Renee Hall said Friday.

Officers ordered the man to lower his weapon and he raised the weapon in officer's direction, Hall said. Officers fired, fearing for their safety, and shot the suspect, Hall said.



The suspect's weapon was located at the scene. No officers were injured, police said.

The stolen vehicle was reported crashing into a citizen's vehicle about 4:45 a.m. in the 3400 block of Indianola Street. The citizen came outside and the suspect reportedly fired shots, police said. The citizen was not struck and the suspect continued on, striking multiple vehicles as he drove away, police said.



Police responded and a chase ensued into the creek in the 9300 block of Havencove Drive near Pleasant Grove.

Police are reviewing the body camera footage.
