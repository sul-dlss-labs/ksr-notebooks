Tucson police have released the name of a man they say was shot by officers after he came out of a bathroom armed with a rifle last week.

Officers called to a domestic dispute Monday evening learned from other family members that Joel R. Andrade, 53, had locked himself in a bathroom.

The family was moved out of the house near West Ajo Way and South Sixth Avenue while officers attempted to coax Andrade out of the bathroom for about two hours, police say.

During their attempts to contact him, Andrade began cutting his neck with a knife, an officer who could see him through a window told other officers at the scene.

"The suspect then began making statements that he wanted officers to kill him," a police news release said.

When police say Andrade came out of the bathroom carrying a rifle, and raising it toward officers, a "less-lethal‚Äù weapon was fired at him. Meanwhile, other officers fired a handgun and rifle. In the Star's first story, police originally said Andrade exited the bathroom with a weapon, though the type of weapon had not been specified at the time.

After being shot, Andrade moved back into the bathroom as officers backed out of the house. Officers tried unsuccessfully to contact Andrade.

A short time later he was pronounced dead, police said.

The officers involved in the shooting are: Sgt. William Corrales, a 21-year veteran; and Officer Ernest Ortiz, a 12-year veteran.

The investigation into the shooting is ongoing.
