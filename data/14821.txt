They found Bayton, who displayed a knife and was “acting erratically,” the press release said.

It said that Bayton “failed to respond to officers’ instructions” and “threatened the safety of the officers.”

One of the officers shot Bayton. He died at a hospital.

Two knives were found at the scene of the shooting. A police spokeswoman said that the officers and witnesses are being interviewed so that police can establish what happened. Until that investigation is complete, she said, she cannot describe Bayton’s behavior in more detail.

Police initially identified the man who died as Donovan Dayton, not Bayton.

The two officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave while the department investigates the shooting. The department said it would release their names Wednesday.
