PHOENIX — Sheriff’s deputies in northern Arizona released Friday body camera footage of a deadly shootout following a domestic violence call.

The Yavapai County Sheriff’s Office said the exchange of gunfire happened on July 21. It said deputies were asked to assist the Chino Valley Police Department on a call in the Paulden area that a man, later identified as Martin Louis Avena, had attacked his wife.

Paulden is about 50 miles southwest of Flagstaff.

Avena, 70, was pulled over a short distance away from his home and pulled out a rifle during the traffic stop.

The footage showed that many shots were exchanged between law enforcement and Avena. After the gunfire died down, officers can be heard saying, “He’s not moving.”

The video showed officers set up a perimeter around Avena’s vehicle after the shootout. Avena was taken to the hospital, where he died a few days later.

The two deputies in the shootout, deputy Theresa Kennedy and police officer Jeffrey Pizzi, were not injured.
