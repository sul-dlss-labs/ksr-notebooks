Two Maryland State Police troopers were shot and a suspect was fatally shot during a barricade situation and shootout in Allegany County, police said.Maryland State Police are trying to figure out what pushed a man to try and kill his wife, shoot two troopers, then try to burn his house down and ultimately lose his life going up a second time against more troopers.The troopers, six-year veterans who were shot in the leg, were flown to Shock Trauma in Baltimore and were treated and released Friday.State troopers with the Cumberland Barrack were called shortly after 11:30 p.m. Thursday to a home in the 11000 block of High Germany Road in Little Orleans on a report of a domestic situation.Police believe the suspect, identified as William Charles Mackenzie, 66, was inside the home when troopers arrived. Troopers learned from his wife that the two were arguing inside the home Thursday night when Mackenzie allegedly brandished a handgun, police said. She said he threatened her with the gun stating, "This ends today," police said.The wife told police a struggle ensued between the two of them and they fell to the ground, police said. As they fell, the gun reportedly fired, police said. The wife was able to escape, and run to a neighboring house to call police, authorities said.Troopers established a perimeter around the home and tried to call Mackenzie repeatedly, but he did not answer, police said.The Maryland State Police Special Tactical Assault Team Element, or STATE Team, was called and used a loudspeaker on their armored vehicle, but Mackenzie refused police requests to surrender and repeatedly said he was not coming out, officials said.State police said Mackenzie fired multiple shots from a bedroom window around 7:30 a.m., striking two members of the STATE team. Police said troopers did not fire in return.About an hour later, Mackenzie exited the house, which appeared to be on fire. Mackenzie brandished a handgun and pointed toward police, ignoring continued commands to drop the weapon, police said. Police said troopers fired and wounded Mackenzie, disarming him of his weapon."He came out again, brandishing a weapon. Fearing for their lives, the troopers fired on this suspect," Maryland State Police spokesman Ron Snyder said.Mackenzie was taken to Washington County Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead Friday morning, police said.Investigators have determined a trooper from the Maryland State Police fired his agency-issued firearm. He has been placed on administrative leave, as is procedure pending the outcome of the investigation. Fire crews and troopers were able to extinguish the fire, police said. Officials are still investigating who started the fire.Dave Perseghin fought back tears as he tried to figure out what drove his friend and neighbor to put himself in a situation where he would end up dead. "It's awful, it's terrible. Surprise ain't the word. It takes my breath away," Perseghin said. "We all knew each other, played horseshoes, cookouts in the summer, and all the sudden, boom, that's all I can say about that.""I thought he was a good person. I thought it was good people. He might've had some problems or something. I didn't know what was going on, but it wasn't good," said Daniel Perseghin, a friend and neighbor.The investigation will be provided to the Allegany County State's Attorney's Office for review once completed.Stay with WBALTV.com and 11 News for more on this developing story.
