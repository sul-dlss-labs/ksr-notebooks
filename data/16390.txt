A man killed Friday night during a fight with officers inside the Farmersville police station died of as single gunshot wound to the chest.

That according to the findings of a autopsy released late Tuesday afternoon by the Tulare County Sheriff’s Department.

Farmersville police said that that prior to the shooting at 909 W. Visalia Road, Estevan Andrade Gomez, a 26-year-old parolee from Farmersville, was arrested following a traffic stop in the city.

Police Chief Mario Krstic said that one of his hands was freed from a handcuff so two officers could photograph a cut to his arm, and when they attempted to fully handcuff him again, Gomez started fighting the officers.

The violent fight moved from the booking room to two other offices in the station, and at one point Gomez reportedly tried to grab an officer’s gun.

Though he wasn’t holding a gun when he was shot, Gomez — who wasn’t stopped by an officer using a taser on him — appeared ready to continue the violent altercation that already had lasted several minutes, and both officers fired their guns at him, Krstic said.

The the autopsy revealed that only one of the shots fired hit the man.

The Sheriff’s department is investigating the shooting to determine if the officers were legally justified in using deadly force, while the Visalia Police Department is looking at whether the officers’ actions followed Farmersville Police Department policies.
