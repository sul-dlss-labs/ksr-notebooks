LEXINGTON COUNTY, SC (WIS/AP) - The Lexington County Coroner has identified the man shot and killed by Lexington County deputies Monday.

Corner Margaret Fisher says Timothy Milliken, 56, died at the scene from several gunshot wounds to his upper body.

Lexington County Sheriff's Department spokesman Adam Myrick said two deputies were called to the 100 block of East Selwood Lane around 4:45 p.m. When they arrived to the home, they found a man attacking a family member with a knife, Myrick said.

"Fearing for the life of the family member, both officers discharged their service weapon, fatally striking the subject," Myrick said in a statement.

Myrick said both deputies, whose names are not being released, have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the results of the shooting investigation by the State Law Enforcement Division.

The condition of the family member who was stabbed was not immediately available.

"This is, really, not only tragic, but it's just so out of the ordinary," neighbor Ralph Rucco said. "Obviously, this is a very quiet community and a very peaceful area. Certainly, there's been zero altercations that we know of since we've lived here, and we've been here are a number of years, so it's startling and it shocking, You know, to have this happen right next door."

This is the 29th officer-involved shooting this year, according to the State Law Enforcement Division.

The Associated Press reports that South Carolina is on pace for 51 officer-involved shootings in 2015, eclipsing the previous 15-year high of 45 officer shootings in 2012. Shootings involving police officers in South Carolina have been on the rise since 27 were reported in 2009, with more than 40 reported in each of the past three years.
