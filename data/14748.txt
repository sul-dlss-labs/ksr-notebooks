The Ohio State Highway Patrol has released video of a short chase on Cleveland streets that ended with a motorcyclist crashing and dying.

Richard McCune died just off West 130th Street and Lorain Avenue in Cleveland late July 4.

A trooper says he saw a motorcycle doing 47 mph in a 25 mph zone. The video shows the biker making a right turn on the tail of a car in front of him. The trooper put on his overhead lights, and the car pulled over, but the motorcyclist seemed to start going faster.

The rider blew a stop sign, so the trooper put on his siren, and says he then started slowing down.

Seconds later, up ahead, sparks and a cloud of smoke. McCune was thrown from his bike and killed. The chase lasted just 2/10 of a mile.

Cleveland Police rarely get involved in chases anymore. This Patrol chase happened on residential streets, and a report notes people were outside.

The Patrol says the trooper's top speed was 51 mph, and the bike went at least 63 mph.

Cleveland accident investigators have also been looking into the incident and the Cuyahoga County medical examiner is still waiting for drug and alcohol test results for McCune.
