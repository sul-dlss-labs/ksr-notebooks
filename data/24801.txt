The name of a man shot and killed in northern Jefferson County after leading Alabama State Troopers on a chase has now been released.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the man as Mitchell Owen Buel. He was 33 and lived in the Gadsden area.

The incident happened early Wednesday on Moncrief Road in Gardendale. State Bureau of Investigation Lt. Jon Riley said the trooper tried to pull over a motorist - now identified as Buel - for aggravated speeding and reckless driving. The driver refused to stop and a pursuit ensued.

The chase went from Gardendale to a dead -end road - Third Avenue North - in Morris. When the trooper tried to take Buel into custody, at least one shot was fired and Buel was struck.

He was pronounced dead on the scene. The trooper was not injured.

Jefferson County District Attorney Mike Anderton and Jefferson County sheriff's deputies also responded. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office has taken over the investigation. No additional details about what led up to the shooting have been released.

Court records show Buel has a lengthy string of drug and gun arrests in Etowah County, as well as numerous traffic violations. Just last month, Buel was indicted on trafficking methamphetamine and other drug charges after an investigation by the Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit.
