Authorities today released the identity of a woman who died Wednesday night at the barrel of a state trooper gun.

Chilton County Coroner Aaron Ellison identified the woman as Wendy Michelle Chappell. Chappell, of Maylene, was 40.

The shooting happened Wednesday night after a man approached a trooper who was stationed at a construction zone in Interstate 65 near the 238 mile marker in Shelby County. He told the trooper that his wife threatened to shoot him.

The trooper tried to stop the woman's vehicle, and she refused to pull over. Several other law enforcement agencies joined in as a pursuit followed, including Chilton County and Shelby County deputies, as well as Clanton police.

Authorities say the woman brandished a firearm during the chase. Lawmen put out spike strips, and stopped her on I-65 southbound at the 212 exit ramp. After a brief standoff, troopers say the woman fired on officers, and officers returned fire.

The woman was pronounced dead on the scene at 10:14 p.m. Her body was taken to the Alabama Department of Forensic Science lab in Montgomery for autopsy.

The ramp remained closed throughout the night, and reopened about noon Thursday.

The State Bureau of Investigation is leading the officer-involved shooting probe and will turn the investigation's findings over to the Chilton County District Attorney's Office for review. Troopers said Thursday they will have no additional comments on the case.
