ST. CHARLES â€¢ A 52-year-old man was shot and killed by a St. Charles police officer Wednesday night, police say.

The incident happened shortly before 9 p.m. Police responded to a disturbance in the first block of Clark Court, near St. Charles High School.

Witnesses told police that the man, who has been identified as Martin G. Brown, was threatening neighbors. He had set off fireworks, which caused a fire, police said.

When officers arrived on scene, Brown began threatening them with a knife and a handgun. Police tried to negotiate with the man, telling him to drop the weapons. When he did not comply, officers used a Taser on Brown, but it was ineffective.

Brown continued to threaten the officers and moved toward them with the weapons, and an officer shot him.

Brown was transported to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. No officers were injured.

The police officer who shot Brown was a 13-year veteran; he was placed on administrative leave pending further investigation.
