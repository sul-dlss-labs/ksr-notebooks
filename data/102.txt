WOOD RIVER â€” A 37-year-old Ravenna woman died Sunday night after she made a left turn into a Hall County Sheriff's Department patrol car four miles north of Wood River on Highway 11.

Kristine Schneider died at St. Francis Medical Center following the two-car crash at 9:07 p.m. Sunday, Hall County Attorney Ellen Totzke said Monday.

Schneider was driving north on Highway 11 in a 1991 Pontiac Grand Am when she tried to turn left onto Husker Highway.

Her car collided with the front driver's side of the patrol car driven south on Highway 11 by Hall County sheriff's deputy Lynn Gardient. Gardient was treated and released from the medical center.

Schneider was not wearing a seat belt, but Gardient was, Totzke said.

Gardient had not been dispatched to an incident before the crash.

"He was just driving down the road," Totzke said about Gardient.

Services for Schneider will be at 10 a.m. Thursday at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church in Ravenna with the Rev. Rod Pruss officiating. Burial will be in Highland Park Cemetery in Ravenna.

Visitation will be from 7 to 9 p.m. Wednesday at Rasmussen Mortuary in Ravenna.

Schneider was a 1980 graduate of Ravenna High School. She returned to Ravenna in June 1999 and worked at IBP in Gibbon.

Survivors include her parents, Milan and Barb Psota of Ravenna; one son, Steven of Denver; one daughter, Kellie of Denver; three brothers, Kirk Psota of Lexington, Kent Psota of Kearney and Kevin Psota of Ravenna; two sisters, Karla Stueben of Boelus and Karen Gascoigne of Arnold; and her grandmother, Mary Vavra of Kearney.

She was preceded in death by her grandfathers and one grandmother.
