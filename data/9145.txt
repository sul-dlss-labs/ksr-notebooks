GREENVILLE, AL (WSFA) - Two people are dead and one is critically wounded after a domestic dispute turned violent in Greenville late Tuesday evening.

The Alabama Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation at the request of the Greenville Police Department since a GPD officer shot and killed a suspect, 60 year-old Jim Heard.

Police officers responded to the domestic disturbance call at a home on Winkler Street around 11:20pm Tuesday. Once inside the house officers discovered Heard's wife, 61-year-old Mildred G. Heard, suffering from "serious gunshot wounds."

Authorities later found the suspect's sister-in-law, 57-year-old Marian D. George. She'd been shot dead in her home, approximately one block away.

Officers reported that when they responded to the call, Mr. Heard confronted them with a pistol. The units fired on and killed the man.

The incident remains under investigation by the ABI, and no additional information is available for public release. ABI's investigative report, when completed, will be provided to the Greenville Police Department and the Butler County District Attorney's Office.
