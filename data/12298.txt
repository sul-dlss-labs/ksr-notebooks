The Delaware State Police Crash Reconstruction Unit is investigating a single vehicle fatal crash that occurred after a trooper attempted to stop a car on U.S. Route 13 (DuPont Highway) in New Castle.

At 12:48 a.m., Saturday, a Delaware State Trooper saw a 1998 Chrysler Sebring traveling northbound in the 100 block of South Dupont Highway (US 13), New Castle, committing moving traffic violations.

The trooper stopped the vehicle in the parking lot of the Hooters on DuPont Highway. The trooper made contact with the operator, identified as Edwin C. Halko, 58, of Newark

The trooper believed he probable cause to believe that Halko was operating the vehicle under the influence of alcohol and requested the man exit the vehicle. Halko refused and put the vehicle in reverse, striking the front of the patrol vehicle.

Halko fled the parking lot at a high rate of speed and into US 13 northbound, making a U-turn and traveling southbound on 13.

The trooper attempted to catch up to the speeding vehicle but was unable to do so. Halko continued southbound and traveled onto westbound U.S. Route 40 toward the Wilton Boulevard intersection.

He apparently lost control of the Sebring and traveled off of the north edge of the roadway into a grassy area, with the driverâ€™s side of the Sebring striking a utility pole in the northeast corner of the intersection. The vehicle continued to travel in a westbound direction coming to rest on Wilton Boulevard. Halko was ejected from the vehicle.

Halko was transported to the Christiana Hospital Trauma Center by ambulance and pronounced dead.
