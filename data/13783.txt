A north-side man, reported to be suicidal, was shot and killed Monday by a sheriff’s deputy.

A woman at a home in the 5200 block of North Crowley Lane, near North La Cholla Boulevard and West Curtis Road, called 911 about 9:30 a.m. She wanted deputies to “check the welfare of her roommate, who was suffering a mental health crisis and had a firearm,” Deputy Courtney Rodriguez, spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, said in a news release.

Deputies with the department’s Mental Health Support Team were called and determined there was a court order for a mental health evaluation of Scott Mitchell, Rodriguez said.

“Deputies were able to get the female out of the house safely and confirmed with her that Mr. Mitchell was suicidal, armed with a firearm and barricaded inside.” Deputies tried to talk Mitchell out but were unsuccessful, Rodriguez said.

Nearby homes were evacuated and school buses diverted.

A SWAT team sent a robot into the home, but Mitchell shot it, disabling its cameras, Rodriguez said.

SWAT members then shot chemical agents into the home. When Mitchell fired at deputies outside the home, he was shot and killed by Sgt. Derek Tyra, a 14-year veteran of the department, Rodriguez said. Mitchell, 46, died just before 3 p.m.
