A man was killed at a gas station in Victorville during an altercation with San Bernardino County Sheriff's Deputies on Saturday.

The suspect was later identified as 24-year-old Daniel David Messmer from Apple Valley.

Deputies responded to a call of a man with a gun inside the Shell Gas Station located on Bear Valley Road at around 4 p.m. According to the caller, Messmer was armed with a handgun and appeared to be under the influence of an unknown substance, the department said.

When deputies arrived at the scene, they located Messmer in the desert area east of the gas station armed with a handgun. After being given multiple commands to drop his weapon, Messmer failed to comply and allegedly pointed his gun at the deputies, prompting what the department called a "deputy-involved shooting." Messmer was later declared dead at the scene by homicide detectives.

The investigation is ongoing and anyone with information is urged to contact the Specialized Investigations Division, Detective Simon DeMuri at (909) 387-3589. Callers can remain anonymous and contact WeTip at (800)78-CRIME or www.wetip.com.
