SAN BERNARDINO >> Prosecutors declined to file charges against a San Bernardino police officer who shot and killed an armed Fontana man in February 2012, according to a report released Thursday.

The San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office said police Officer Jason Heilman was justified in shooting Anthony Gilmore Jr., 25.

“Once Gilmore armed himself with a firearm while resisting unlawfully the officers in question, the officers involved had the legal right to engage Gilmore in lawful self-defense,” attorneys wrote in their report.

Police encountered Gilmore after stopping a vehicle he was riding in near the corner of 16th and D streets in San Bernardino on Feb. 29. Officers say the driver was speeding and ran a stop sign, among other violations.

After asking Gilmore to get out of the car, Gilmore and Heilman got into a struggle on the ground. San Bernardino police Officer Byron Clark grabbed Gilmore’s upper body.

Heilman saw a 9mm Taurus handgun nearby that didn’t belong to either officer and shouted, “Gun!”

“At this time, Gilmore’s arm came out and grabbed the gun and immediately brought the gun under him,” prosecutors wrote.

Heilman yelled, “Shoot ‘em!” several times, started to get up from the ground and fired his gun two or three times. Clark was tangled up with Gilmore on the ground at the time.

When Gilmore began rolling over onto his back, Heilman fired three to five more times. Police determined that Gilmore’s gun was loaded and that he wasn’t allowed to possess the firearm due to a felony conviction.
