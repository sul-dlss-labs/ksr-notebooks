BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (WBKO) - One man is dead after police were on scene for hours Wednesday afternoon in a Bowing Green neighborhood.

According to Bowling Green Police, the owner of the apartment complex on Creekwood Avenue was in the process of an eviction. Police say the tenant then fired a shot that went through the wall of the neighboring apartment. Itâ€™s unclear if anyone was home during that time.

The owner was not injured and left the property and called police around 2 p.m., police said.

When officers were arriving on the scene, another shot was reportedly fired, but not directly toward them. Officers spent hours outside the apartment, attempting to negotiate with the suspect believed to be inside.

The Critical Response Team arrived before 6 p.m. and entered the apartment where they located a deceased male who died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police have not released the identity of the deceased at this time.
