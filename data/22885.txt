After being shot with a stun gun the man was detained and put in hand and leg restraints; yet continued to violently struggle with deputies and spit at them.

Deputies believed the man was suffering from a drug overdose so they gave him Naloxone.

Unfortunately, he was pronounced dead at a local hospital emergency room at 4:30 p.m.
