ESCONDIDO, Calif. – Two people were killed and two were injured early Thursday when a short police chase ended in a high-speed crash in Escondido.

The chase began around midnight in the vicinity of East Grand Avenue and South Midway Drive, after a patrol officer pulled over a silverChrysler PT Cruiser because of a faulty tail light, according to Escondido police. As the officer was approaching it on foot, the female driver sped off. The officer got back in his patrol car and followed the silver car, but the suspect car went out of control and crashed into several parked vehicles on East Grand Avenue near South Ash Street, landing on its side.

The driver, a female Escondido resident in her 20s, was killed in the crash, as was a 19-year-old male passenger, police said. A man in his 20s crawled out of the wreck and was taken to a hospital for evaluation of minor injuries. A woman in her 20s also survived. She was hospitalized with serious injuries, police said.

A SigAlert was issued for East Grand Avenue between South Ash Street and Harding Street, but the streets were reopened in time for the morning commute.

The woman driving the car had a California identification card, but she did not have a driver’s license, investigators said.
