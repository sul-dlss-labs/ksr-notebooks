Two shootings late Sunday night on Miami Beach - including one involving an officer - claimed the lives of two people during the holiday weekend.

Police remained on two scenes since late last night after an incident near the 200 block of Ocean Drive, where two people were shot after a reported parking spot dispute. Both were transported to Ryder Trauma Center, where one of those vicitms died.

According to police, the two victims were standing on the sidewalk of 2nd Street and Ocean Drive when a white BMW tried to parallel park along the curb. The driver began to hit the victim's car while he was backing into the spot. When the car couldn't fit into the spot, he began to force push the victim's car back in an attempt to move the car.

When the victims saw this, they confronted the driver and that's when an argument ensued. That's when one of the victims saw the driver pass a gun to Jeffery Alexander, 19. Police said Alexander began to shoot and hit both victims. One victim was shot in the leg; he was later released from the hospital. However, the other victim was shot in the back and later died.

The BMW then took off and police began to chase them. The BMW and two police cruisers crashed on 5th Street and Alton Road. That's when two officers fired their guns at the people inside the BMW. One person was shot, and eventually died.

Miami Beach Police Chief Daniel Oates says they captured two other suspects at the scene while a fourth fled on foot and was captured over an hour later.

The victim was able to positively identify Alexander as the shooter. He was eventually arrested and charged with second degree murder, and attempted second degree murder.

The other people in the car were eventually released.
