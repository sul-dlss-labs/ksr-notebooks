D'IBERVILLE, Mississippi -- Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove says searchers have found the body of a 21-year-old man who walked backward into a river rather than face a traffic stop.

He says an autopsy will be performed Monday on James Dwight King of D'Iberville.

King's body was found Sunday afternoon near the spot where he went in to the Tchoutacabouffa River Saturday.

According to police, King fled from a traffic stop, stopped on a bridge and walked backward into the river.

Chief Wayne Payne says officers tried unsuccessfully to get him to leave the water. They dove in after King began to struggle, shouting that he could not swim. He went under before they could reach him.
