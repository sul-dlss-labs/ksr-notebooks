A Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's deputy shot and killed a man Friday morning, when the CPSO's effort to serve a criminal arrest warrant took a violent turn. It happened around 6:30 a.m. when deputies went to the home on Angela Loop in Sulphur.

The warrants were for aggravated rape and aggravated incest. Although the man's name has not been released by authorities, KPLC has learned it's Everett Keill; and according to our source, Keill came out of the home with a gun. That information does fit with what detectives will confirm. Captain Ramby Cormier explains: "As the officers tried to execute their arrest, a shooting took place which left the subject fatally wounded." The man reportedly told deputies, when they arrived at his home, that they wouldn't get him alive.

Further details surrounding the shooting are not being released at this time, as the investigation is ongoing. That probe, however, has now been turned over to Louisiana State Police and according Trooper Stephen LaFargue, it could take several months to complete. "We are in the initial phase which we call the fact-finding stage of the investigation. We still have to process the crime scene and wait on Baton Rouge technicians to come in and do that."

The name of the deputy who fired the shots has not been released. According to CPSO policies, the deputy will be relieved of his regular duties for two days with pay.
