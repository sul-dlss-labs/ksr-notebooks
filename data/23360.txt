A suspect wanted for a double homicide out of Michigan is dead after a standoff with Richmond Police.

Police say they were called to the scene around 2 p.m. of reports about the suspect possible staying at the Super 8 Hotel off Keeneland Road in Richmond.

After verifying the suspect's vehicle in the parking lot and learning he was in the hotel on the second floor, Police say they cleared the floor and began trying to get the suspect to come out of the room.

Police say they heard one single gunshot in the room. Upon entry, they discovered the suspect had killed himself. The Madison County Coroner confirmed the name of the victim as Calvin Chappel, 34 of Detroit. The coroner says no autopsy will be performed.

Fox 2 in Detroit reports Chappel was a correctional officer at a corrections facility in Michigan.

“We have investigators that are going to comb through anything inside that could be of value to Michigan, to the Detroit Police Department, as well as conduct our own death investigation here through the remainder of the evening,” said Trooper Robert Purdy.

Several Michigan stations are reporting that the man is connected with the Monday morning murders of a man and woman on Carter Street in Detroit.
