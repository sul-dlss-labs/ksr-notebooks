Officer Involved Shooting In Elmore County Leaves One Man Dead

by WAKA 8

A man is dead after an Elmore County deputy shot him, according to Sheriff Bill Franklin.

The shooting happened on Timber Lane in Emerald Mountain.

Officers were called out around 6 p.m. Wednesday night due to a domestic dispute.

Franklin says the man refused commands to drop an 18-inch machete-like knife while walking toward deputies and his father, so a deputy opened fire, firing three rounds into his upper torso.

Franklin identified the dead man as 32-year-old Jonathan Pears. He did not release the name of the deputy who shot him.

The man died at the scene.

A third party agency is investigating the incident.
