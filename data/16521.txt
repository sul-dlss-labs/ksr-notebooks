IRWINDALE >> A man died Saturday after police took him into custody with the use of a Taser while responding to reports he was acting strangely along Ramona Boulevard, officials said.

The incident began about 3:30 p.m. when officers responded to a gas station in Baldwin Park along Ramona Boulevard at the 605 Freeway after someone reported the man was lying on the sidewalk, Baldwin Park Police and Los Angeles County Sheriff’s officials said.

The man, who was reported to be in his 40s, was calm when officers arrived but witnesses directed them to a parking lot across the street.

“When officers arrived, they were told that the suspect had stolen a large American flag and flag pole from a gas station and had been swinging it at cars and people in the area,” deputy Crystal Hernandez of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau said.

The man ran from police who chased him across the city border to Ramona Boulevard and Schabarum Avenue in Irwindale while still clutching the flagpole and a struggle ensued, Hernandez said.

Officers used a Taser to subdue the suspect and get him into custody, Baldwin Park Police sergeant Shawn Blackburn said.

“Once he was handcuffed they noticed he was no longer responsive,” Hernandez said. “The officers took the handcuffs off the suspect and immediately began to render aid pending the arrival of paramedics. The suspect was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.”

The man’s cause of death will be determined through a coroner’s investigation.

The investigation is being spearheaded by the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500, or tips may be submitted anonymously to LA Regional Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477.
