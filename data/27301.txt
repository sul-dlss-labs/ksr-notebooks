PHOENIX (AP) â€” Phoenix police shot and killed a man after he fired on an officer, who narrowly escaped serious injury thanks to his portable radio, authorities said.

The shooting occurred Monday night during a struggle with the suspect, who had been bicycling downtown when two officers tried to stop him for traffic violations, Sgt. Maggie Cox said. She did not say what were the violations.

The man pulled out a handgun and fired at least once at one of the officers, according to Cox. A bullet struck the officer's radio, which was positioned in the front of his vest. Both officers returned fire.

The suspect, who was identified Tuesday as 28-year-old Xavier Jaime Rovie, was transported to a hospital by firefighters where he died.

The officer who was struck was released from a hospital after treatment for minor injuries. The other officer was not injured, the statement said.
