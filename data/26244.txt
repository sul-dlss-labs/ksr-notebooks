OAK LAWN, IL -- The Cook County Medical Examiner has ruled the death of a man who barricaded himself in his apartment a suicide. The man is in his 60s and died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

The manâ€™s family members called Oak Lawn police on Saturday and asked them to check on the man, who police said had made statements about harming himself. When officers arrived at the apartment around 8:30 a.m. in the 10400 block of South Mason Avenue, they heard what sounded like a gunshot.

A community safety alert was sent out directing residents to shelter in place and avoid the area. The South Suburban Emergency Response Team was activated and for the next six hours officers tried to make contact with the man using a bullhorn, imploring the man to come out. A drone was deployed; when no movement was detected inside, police entered the unit. The man was found deceased. Patch will not be publishing his name.
