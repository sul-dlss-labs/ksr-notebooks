A federal lawsuit claims Hammond police Tasered and kneed a 29-year-old Chicago man to death in May 2008 at a gas station on the city's north side.

But Hammond Police Chief Brian Miller said his officers were "absolutely not" Paul J. Swider's killers. Miller pointed to the coroner's report, which found that Swider died of pneumonia, a blood infection, blood clotting, internal bleeding and organ failure.

The parties agree on one thing: an officer shocked Swider with an electroshock gun on May 6, 2008, at the Skyway Shell Station on Indianapolis Boulevard near the state line. Swider died two days later at St. Margaret Mercy Healthcare Centers in Hammond.

The lawsuit claims two Hammond officers, defendants Dan Young and Michael Atherton, helped to unjustifiably detain, shock and knee Swider. The suit, filed by Swider's widow, Gloria Rodriguez, claims the officers used excessive force and lacked "reasonable grounds" to arrest Swider. Rodriguez is suing the city, the Police Department, Miller and the officers.

Reached by phone Monday, Rodriguez said Swider's fight with the officers killed him. She declined to say how she and her lawyer can prove that claim.

"We would not have pursued anything unless I felt in my heart that that was the case," Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez's lawyer could not be reached Monday.

Miller says police were called to the store because Swider was harassing and attacking customers and employees. He put his arms around a UPS deliveryman, Miller said. Swider appeared "extremely intoxicated," Miller said. The officers "grappled" with Swider, but he did not comply with officers' orders, Miller said. An officer shocked Swider by touching the weapon to him, although the shocking probes were not fired, Miller said.

Hammond police investigated the officers' conduct, and they were not disciplined.

"The officers did nothing wrong," Miller said.
