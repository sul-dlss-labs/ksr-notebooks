The family of a man shot to death by a New Orleans Police Department officer during a surveillance operation a year ago filed a lawsuit Wednesday in federal court against the city, the officer and Police Superintendent Michael Harrison.

The wrongful death suit brought by the parents of Arties Manning III alleges that a “botched” sting that was meant to snare an unrelated armed robberies suspect led to the death of an innocent man.

The suit also alleges that Harrison compounded the family's heartbreak by defaming Manning as a “suspect” in the armed robberies on the night of the shooting. Police later acknowledged that he had nothing to do with the crimes.

Although wrongful death and excessive force lawsuits against the Police Department were common a decade ago, they appear to have slowed to a trickle since the force began implementing major reforms under an agreement with the federal government. Federal monitors said in a May 2017 report that no such suits had been filed in the two previous years.
