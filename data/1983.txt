Agents of the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation are investigating the shooting of a Sioux City man by an Onawa, Iowa, police officer after a high-speed pursuit that ended at 4 a.m. Saturday in Harrison County.

At about 3:30 a.m., an officer from the Onawa Police Department observed a pickup truck being driven south on Interstate 29 at the Onawa exit, according to Bob Henderson, special agent in charge with the Iowa DCI. The officer checked its speed at 101 mph and pursued the truck.

The pursuit continued down the interstate, reaching speeds of 106 mph. Later in the pursuit, the Onawa officer was joined by Missouri Valley Police and a Harrison County deputy.

Officers were able to flatten two of the pickup tires with "stop sticks." The pickup crossed the interstate and entered the northbound Missouri Valley rest area. Once in the rest area, the suspect driver of the pickup exited his vehicle and approached the Onawa officer. The officer fired, killing the suspect, who was identified as Francisco Ponce, 22, of Sioux City.

Agents of the DCI were requested to investigate the shooting by Onawa Police Chief Gary Addy. DCI agents, along with the city and county officerts from Monona and Harrison Counties are continuing this investigation.

An autopsy will be performed on Ponce, but the timeline for the results was unknown Saturday.

Despite media requests, Henderson said no additional details regarding the officer's names or other specific details of the shooting would be released Saturday as it was very early in the investigation. He would not confirm whether Ponce was armed or unarmed at the time of the shooting.
