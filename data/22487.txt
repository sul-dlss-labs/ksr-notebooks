GRAPHIC=SCAM ALERT 7 Animation Today in your Scam Alert 7 Report -



Don't call it a scam if YOU don't read

the fine print.

*CG 11500 The Better Business Bureau reports that

a growing number of consumers are



finding charges on their credit card

statements and debits from their bank

account for discount buying club

memberships that they never agreed to

or did not agree to renew after an

initial trial offer.



New members for these clubs are usually

solicited through mailings, phone

calls, and increasingly through what is

called "upselling" - encouraging a

customer who is calling to buy one item

to order another product. Often after

the conversation consumers are sent

packages detailing the buying club

program, but to some people this

material looks like junk mail and they

throw it away. As a result, people may

not know they have enrolled in a club

until they find charges on their

credit-card bills.



To avoid surprise charges, the Better

Business Bureau encourages consumers to

Take- "Pay attention to the fine print Pay attention to the fine print on TV on TV screens when ordering screens when ordering merchandise. Does merchandise" it indicate that you will be enrolled

in a club that offers discounts on

other products?

Take- "When you receive club offers When you receive club offers through through the mail, be sure to read the the mail, be sure to read the materials

materials thoroughly" thoroughly. Some clubs offer "free

trial" memberships. If you do not call

to cancel the offer within a certain

number of days, you will automatically

be charged for membership.

Take- "If ordering anything by phone, If ordering anything by phone, be be alert" alert! If you are made an offer you are

not interested in, make sure you are

very clear in refusing it.

Take- "Review your credit card and Review your credit card and debit card debit card statements carefully" statements carefully. Once someone has

your account number, it is possible to

charge you or debit your account even

if you never agreed to purchase their

services. If you find unauthorized

charges on your statements, dispute

them immediately, in a letter to the

company that made the charge, and in

writing to your credit card company or

bank.

Steve on Camera Steve on Camera



Buying clubs can be a great way to save

money on items you want- just be sure

you know all the details before signing

up.

avoiding signing up for things you

WE THE JURY.....IN THE CRIME OF MURDER.



With that, O-J Simpson was a free man.



Simpson was accused of the June 19-94

murders of his ex-wife Nicole and Ron

Goldman.



The verdict brought sharply divided

reactions from around the viewing area.







PATRICIA JACKSON/LYNCHBURG RESIDENT: HE

HAD TO BE INNOCENT BECAUSE WHY WOULD

THERE BE ALL THAT BLOODSHED?



JAY FREGOLEE/ROANOKE RESIDENT: WHY DID

HE RUN AWAY IN THAT BRONCO CHASE. TO ME

THAT PROVED RIGHT THEN AND THERE THAT

HE WAS GUILTY.



In a statement, Simpson vowed to find

the real killer. The case remains

unsolved.



BEEN REAL BAD. BEEN REAL BAD AND REAL

SAD...



In June, parts of Central and Southwest

Virginia were pounded by rain.



Floods swallowed up cars and homes.



One downpour in Franklin County caused

multiple deaths.



Three men were killed when their pickup

truck crashed into a 25- foot hole.



The story was just as sad in Campbell

County-- where water washed out



Timberlake dam.



Two lives were claimed there-- one of

them a rescue worker.



Andrea Ballengee was crowned Miss

Virginia on July 1st, but three weeks

later, she was stripped of her title.



Pageant organizers said she lied about

her academic record-- claiming to be a

member of Phi Beta Kappa and a first a

year law student at the University of

Miami.



The controversy opened the door for

runner- up Amber Medlin.



AMBER MEDLIN/MISS VIRGINIA 1995: IT WAS

JUST AS HONORABLE TO RECEIVE THE MISS

VIRGINIA TITLE IN THIS WAY RATHER THAN

ON JULY FIRST.



And it was a good year for Virginia

Tech sports..



For the first time in 22 years, the

men's basketball team captured the



N- I- T championship.



Meanwhile on the gridiron, Tech shook

off two early season losses and plowed

through the rest of its schedule.



The Hokies wound up co- champs of the

Big East and earned a bid to the Sugar

Bowl.



That's a look at some of the headlines



from 1995.
