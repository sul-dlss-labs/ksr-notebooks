Antonio Diaz, a 49-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police Tuesday, Sept. 6, in the 100 block of West 101st Street in Broadway-Manchester, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers responded to a call regarding an assault with a deadly weapon about 9 p.m., according to a Los Angeles Police Department news release. When police arrived, Diaz's family members told them he had been "involved in a weapon-related assault." They then directed the officers to a detached room in the backyard where they said Diaz was staying.

When police entered the room, Diaz confronted them, officials said. The officers told Diaz to raise his hands, but he allegedly pointed a gun at them instead, police said. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred.

Paramedics were called and Diaz was pronounced dead at the scene. Coroner's records show he suffered several gunshot wounds to the torso and legs.

After the shooting, authorities recovered Diaz's gun, which ended up being a replica of a small-caliber revolver, police said.

No officers were hurt during the incident.

The LAPD's Force Investigation Division will be investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Anyone with information about Diaz's death is asked to call police at (877) LAPD-24-7.Tipsters who would like to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
