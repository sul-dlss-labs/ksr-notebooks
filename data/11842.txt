HAYWARD (CBS SF) - A man who was shot and killed by Hayward police after he allegedly reversed his car toward officers early Monday has been identified by police as 24-year-old Edgar Alvarez.

Alvarez, a Hayward resident who police said was a documented gang member, was suspected in a shooting that occurred at about 1 a.m. Monday at the Dirty Bird Lounge at 29308 Mission Blvd.

The shooting left two people injured, a bar patron and the DJ, Hayward police Sgt. Mark Ormsby said.

The patron was treated at a hospital and released, and the DJ suffered only a minor wound to his lip, Ormsby said.

Officers investigating the shooting learned that the shooter had fled in a car described as a dark-colored Buick or Cadillac. Police searched the area and found a car matching that description on Tennyson Road, west of Mission Boulevard, police said.

While the officers were attempting to make contact with the driver, he allegedly reversed his car toward them and police shot him, killing him, police said.

He was later identified as Alvarez. A handgun was found in his vehicle, police said.

On Monday night, a vigil for Alvarez turned into a protest that ended in 11 arrests, Hayward police said.

Ormsby said a group of 50 to 70 people gathered around 7:30 p.m. Monday near East 13th Street and Tennyson Road for a vigil. The arrests were made after the group blocked traffic several times by placing objects, including couches, in the roadway, police said.
