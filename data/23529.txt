WEAKLEY COUNTY – The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is investigating after a Kentucky man was killed an officer-involved shooting in Weakley County on Tuesday morning.

Salvador Byassee, 34, of Clinton, Kentucky, was shot and killed by an officer with the Hickman County Sheriff's Department in Kentucky, according to the TBI.

The shooting occurred near the 300 block of State Line Road after the officer pursued a man into Weakley County.

After the vehicle pursuit ended, Byassee fled on foot before the officer encountered him with a knife. The officer then shot at Byassee, striking and killing him, according to the release.

Prior to the shooting, at approximately 1:15 a.m. Tuesday morning, Byassee did not yield to a sobriety checkpoint being conducted by the Kentucky State Police on Highway 1218 in Hickman County, which resulted in an initial pursuit by the Kentucky State Police and the Hickman County Sheriff’s Department.

Byassee later stole a car in Weakley County and was again located by the Hickman County Sheriff’s Department while they were still in the area. This second pursuit ended with the fatal shooting, according to the TBI.

No law enforcement officers were injured in the incident, according to the TBI.

TBI special agents will submit their investigative findings to 27th District Attorney General Tommy Thomas for his review and consideration, according to the release.
