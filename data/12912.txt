The Cobb policeman who shot and killed an Acworth man late Friday was identified this evening as Officer B.J. Daniel.

About 8:10 p.m. June 7, Daniel and other officers from Zone 1 (Northwest Cobb) went to a home in the 3500 block of Dallas-Acworth Highway in reference to a domestic dispute, said Officer Mike Bowman, the spokesman for the Cobb County Police Department.

"Information was provided to the officers that the subject was armed with a handgun and possibly suicidal," he said. "As the officer arrived, he observed the individual in front of the residence, armed with a firearm. The firearm was discharged and the officer was forced to fire his weapon to stop the threat."
