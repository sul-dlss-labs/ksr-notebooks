Two men who died in an altercation in an Alterra neighborhood Saturday have been identified, and Maricopa Police Department is calling it a domestic dispute.

Tony Shakir, 38, is suspected of killing Randy Phillips, 49, and then turning the gun on himself after a five-hour standoff with police.

According to MPD spokesman Ricardo Alvarado, there had been a dispute between Shakir and his ex-wife at the Windrose Drive property. When her friend Phillips tried to intervene he was shot “multiple times at close range.”

MPD was called to the scene when the gun shots were heard in the neighborhood around 4:30 p.m. When officers arrive, Shakir’s ex-wife and her two children left the house, and she explained to them what had happened. Shakir then barricaded himself in the home.

Alvarado said after telephone contact was lost with Shakir, the Department of Public Safety SWAT team entered the home at 11:30 p.m. and found Shakir dead in the garage. A handgun was recovered at the scene.

Phillips’s body was found in the family room.

The ex-wife told MPD there was a history of domestic violence between her and Shakir, but it was not reported to police because she feared for her safety.

“Before incidents like these escalate, victims of domestic violence can come forward and seek help from law enforcement and we can put them in touch with services that can help,” Chief Steve Stahl said.
