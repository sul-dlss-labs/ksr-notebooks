A Chicago police officer was justified when he fatally shot an alleged gang member who shot at officers in Rogers Park, a police review found Wednesday. The man, identified as Anthony Morgan, abruptly changed direction and grabbed his waistband after he spotted a squad car, police spokeswoman Monique Bond said. Morgan fired three shots at one officer who chased him on foot before the officer fired back and killed him, police said.
