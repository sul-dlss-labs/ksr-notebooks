Donald Douglas Lee MacFarlane, a 53-year-old white man, was shot and killed by police officers Wednesday, March 7, at Ocean Boulevard and Chestnut Place in Long Beach, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Long Beach Police were called to a home near Long Beach Boulevard and 4th Street around 3:55 p.m. regarding a “hysterical female” who said her husband had a gun and was threatening to blow up the Glenn M. Anderson Federal Building with explosives in his white Chevrolet van, according to a department news release.

Officers spotted a white van nearby in the 300 block of West Ocean Boulevard. The driver, a white man later identified as MacFarlane, got out holding what appeared to be a handgun and stood with his arms outstretched, according to photos published by the Press-Telegram.

MacFarlane refused to drop the weapon, the news release said, and told officers he had explosives in his vehicle.

Officers cordoned off the area near the van and evacuated part of City Hall. After two hours of negotiations, SWAT officers began shooting 40 mm rubber baton rounds and tear gas at MacFarlane and released a police dog in an effort to subdue him, according to the release.

MacFarlane then pointed his gun at SWAT officers, who fired at him, the release said.

Paramedics took MacFarlane to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:11 p.m., according to coroner’s records. No one else was injured.

Investigators later determined that MacFarlane’s handgun was an airsoft pistol, which fires plastic pellets, the news release said.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Arson Explosives Detail searched the van and found no explosives, according to the release.

The bomb squad searched two other locations — a van and garage unit MacFarlane was renting in the 600 block of Elm Street in Long Beach and a box truck in the 18000 block of Tulsa Street in Granada Hills. No explosives were found in either location.

MacFarlane was from Oregon, according to the release, although department spokesman Sgt. Bradley Johnson couldn’t elaborate. The coroner’s office said MacFarlane had family in Oregon, but his last address was not known.

Investigators don’t have a motive for MacFarlane’s actions, according to the news release. Johnson said he couldn’t comment on anything said during the standoff.
