A police officer shot and killed a former convict who was holding relatives hostage Tuesday morning at his sister’s house on the 1500 block of South Monterey Avenue, authorities said.

Responding to a 911 call from a family member, police found Manuel Zaragoza Lopez, 24, using his mother as a shield and holding a knife and a barbecue fork, authorities said. An officer fired after Lopez lunged at him, police said. Lopez was released Thursday from state prison, authorities said.

Lopez was taken to an Upland hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The San Bernardino County district attorney’s office will review a police investigation of the shooting.
