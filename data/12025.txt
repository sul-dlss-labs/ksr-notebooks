VISTA — A 21-year-old man who crashed his car and killed his passenger while fleeing pursuing law enforcement officers in Oceanside pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges Tuesday.

Jorge Luis Lopez was also charged with gross vehicular manslaughter while intoxicated and with evading police during the incident, which started with a chase shortly before 1 a.m. on Friday.

Lopez faces 22 years to life in prison if convicted, Deputy District Attorney Patrick Espinoza said. Lopez was ordered jailed in lieu of $2 million bail.

California Highway Patrol Officer Jim Bettencourt said Friday that Lopez was behind the wheel of a 1991 Honda Civic when a CHP officer spotted him driving faster than 100 mph on state Route 78.

The officer followed the Civic onto northbound Interstate 5 and tried to pull the car over. The driver instead exited on eastbound Mission Avenue, Bettencourt said.

The driver turned onto eastbound Mesa Drive, where the car hit a dip at about 80 mph. The driver lost control of the car, and it slammed into a parked pickup on a two-lane stretch of the street in a residential neighborhood.

Lopez’s passenger, Marco Gutierrez, 21, of Oceanside, died at the scene.

Espinoza said Lopez had three speeding tickets in 2010, including one for driving faster than 100 mph. In 2011, Lopez was convicted of alcohol-related reckless driving, commonly known as a “wet reckless.”
