A man was found dead Sunday evening when the SWAT team forced their way into an apartment in Lake View on the North Side.

SWAT officers were called about 6 p.m. after police were confronted by a man who then locked himself inside an apartment in the 500 block of West Aldine Avenue, Chicago police said.

The SWAT team entered the apartment over an hour later and found the man unresponsive, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

An autopsy found the 38-year-old died of multiple gunshot wounds and ruled his death a suicide, according to the Cook County medical examinerâ€™s office.
