HAMMOND | A federal judge threw out part of a lawsuit Monday regarding a Merrillville-based gang leader killed in 2007 by a federal agent.

Federal Judge Philip Simon dismissed part of a suit filed by Sandra Rincon, sister of 28-year-old Rosalio Rincon, who was fatally shot by a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agent. Authorities have said Rosalio Rincon was trying to run down the agent with a car at the time of the September 2007 shooting.

In July 2010, Sandra Rincon filed a lawsuit in Hammond federal court against various government agencies and personnel, including the Justice Department, DEA and agents working on behalf of the DEA.

On Monday, Simon dismissed part of Sandra Rincon's case that alleged authorities violated Rincon's civil rights, a claim Sandra Rincon and her lawyers had agreed to be dismissed, Rincon family lawyer Kevin Smith said Monday.

The 2007 suit claimed officers trying to arrest Rincon were negligent, used excessive force and that Rincon's death had accrued damages entitled to his minor son.

Smith said Monday the family's wrongful death claim alleging negligence against the government and an officer working for the DEA remains.

"We'll continue to prosecute it," Smith said.

U.S. attorney's office spokeswoman Mary Hatton did not return a Times call.

Rosalio Rincon was the purported former leader of Northwest Indiana's faction of the Latin Dragons street gang.

Authorities said Rosalio Rincon was driving a car with another suspected drug dealer near Southlake mall off U.S. 30 when Rincon sped toward a DEA officer standing in the road. The officer fired one round into Rincon's chest.

At the time of his death, Rincon was facing several federal charges, including conspiracy to distribute more than 500 grams of cocaine.
