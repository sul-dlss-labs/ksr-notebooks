DIXFIELD â€” Maine authorities have released the names of the two men who died in weekend snowmobile crashes.

Maine State Police say 47-year-old Daniel Lavorgna of Mexico died from injuries suffered in a snowmobile accident in Dixfield at about 12:45 a.m. Saturday.

Police say Lavorgna appeared to have been traveling at a high rate of speed on Main Street, crossed the road, struck two snowbanks and came to rest after crashing through some fencing.

Police say speed and alcohol appear to be factors.

That death came just hours after Leonardo Rodrigues, of Everett, Mass., died when his snowmobile struck a parked vehicle in Byron late Friday night.
