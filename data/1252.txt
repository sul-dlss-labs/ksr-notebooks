A man wanted for allegedly killing his ex-girlfriend and her cousin in South-Central L.A. in front of five children has died during a running gun battle with deputies, authorities said.

Otto Glass, 35, tried to flee from Kern County sheriff’s deputies late Friday after they attempted to stop him in the 1125 block of Suncrest Road in Rosamond, Cmdr. Steve Del Tour said.

Glass was shot by deputies at least once, but authorities said it was a self-inflicted gunshot to the chest that killed him.
