Investigation into Male's Death at 9312 Kingflower Circle

October 11, 2013 - Houston police are awaiting autopsy results in the death of a male suspect following an incident at 9312 Kingflower Circle about 1:30 a.m. on Sept. 28.



The suspect, Manuel A. Baltazar (H/m, DOB: 6-21-93), was transported to Memorial Hermann Southeast Hospital in critical condition. Doctors pronounced him dead on Thursday (Oct. 10).



HPD Homicide Division Sergeants M. Dillingham and P. Jewell reported:



HPD patrol officers were dispatched to a suspicious person call at the above address and found Baltazar irate and in the middle of the street screaming loudly. As officers approached and gave Baltazar verbal commands, he became more agitated and combative, swinging at and striking the officers. Officers deployed their Conducted Energy Devices (CED) with no effect on Baltazar. Officers deployed their CEDs once more and eventually took Baltazar into custody.



HFD paramedics arrived and as they were treating Baltazar, he began having seizures. Information obtained from family members determined Baltazar had ingested narcotics, possibly LSD. He was then transported to the hospital.



This case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions.
