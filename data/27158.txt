MILWAUKEE â€” New video shows a close call for a Milwaukee police officer who was nearly shot during a chase. A man running from police back in December turned and fired just feet away from that officer.

The dash camera video shows the high-speed pursuit that started the incident back on Dec. 15. Police said Kean Walker, 23, drove off when they tried to stop him near 47th and Hampton.



Police chased the car for more than two miles. In the video, you see the car crash and then Walker takes off running. Police said he fired multiples times at officers, you see it in the video with the muzzle flashes as the gun fires. The Milwaukee Police Union said it appeared Walker and the officer were just four feet apart when the shooting started.

"I don't know how an officer wasn't killed during that situation," said Dale Bormann, president of the Milwaukee Police Association. "I see how close they were."

Bormann said when he watched the video he could see it took a second for the officer to react.

"You can see the suspect pull the gun, fire and shot and the officer didn't go down to the ground right away. It took a split second before he realized what was going on and then he rolled on the ground," said Bormann.

Three officers were involved in that shooting. Chief Alfonso Morales spoke that night about what happened.

"The suspect exited the vehicle and immediately fired shots at officers. Three officers fired back," said Morales.

Walker was shot and later died at the hospital. A loaded gun was recovered at the scene.

"That split second anything can happen to us on the street," said Bormann.

The Wauwatosa Police Department is investigating the shooting. There is also an internal investigation at the Milwaukee Police Department. The officers involved are currently on administrative leave pending those investigations.
