BOONE, Iowa (AP) -- Authorities say a man who was shot during an altercation with Boone police officers has died.

Twenty-seven-year-old Seth Miller was killed in the incident at about 10:30 p.m. Sunday.

The Iowa Department of Public Safety says a preliminary investigation shows that three police officers fired their weapons, but authorities did not release details on what prompted the officers to shoot.

Officials say the officers responded to a 911 call about a man with a gun at the Eastside Hideaway Lounge in Boone. The officers confronted Miller in an alley, and about 20 minutes later an ambulance was called after shots were fired.

Miller was taken to a local hospital and later transferred to a hospital in Des Moines where he died.

The investigation is continuing.
