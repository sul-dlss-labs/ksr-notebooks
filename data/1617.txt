Two people were killed last night during a domestic dispute at a pawn shop in East Harlem, and the police killed a suspect after he pointed his gun at them, the authorities said.

The police were called to E-Z Pawn, at 1878 Lexington Avenue at 116th Street, just before 6 p.m. about what seemed to be a dispute, in which shots had been fired. When the police arrived, they saw two men who they believed worked in the shop trying to prevent a man armed with a revolver from coming in. During the struggle, the gunman shot one of the men, said William H. Allee, Jr., the chief of detectives. The other man ran out into the street.

The gunman's estranged girlfriend, who worked at the shop, had received a call from him earlier in the day, during which they argued, and he threatened to come over, the police said. The woman had a child by the gunman, the police said. After the gunman shot the man outside, he went inside and followed the woman to a small, cramped area in the back of the building, where he attacked her, Chief Allee said.

''There is a spear gun laying next to the body,'' another police official said about the woman. ''It appears that after he ran out of bullets, he stabbed her with the spear gun in the head.'' An autopsy is to be performed to determine the cause of her death.
