A man who forced his way into a casino office this week died after a scuffle with security guards, the authorities said. The body of the man, Lanier J. Blunt, 29, of Sicklerville, was found by the police in the lobby of a Sands Hotel and Casino telephone reservation office. Jeffrey Blitz, the Atlantic County prosecutor, said that Mr. Blunt, appearing disoriented, had forced his way into the building just before midnight on Monday. He was forcibly subdued by in-house guards, Mr. Blitz said, and was unconscious when the police arrived. He was pronounced dead at 12:54 a.m. at Atlantic City Medical Center. An autopsy was inconclusive. Toxicology test results were pending.
