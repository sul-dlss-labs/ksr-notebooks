Lawrenceburg teenager dies nearly a week after crash

LAWRENCEBURG, Ky. (WTVQ)- A Lawrenceburg teenager in a crash last week in Anderson County has died, according to the Fayette County Coroner’s Office.

The coroner says 18-year-old Jill Tyler Hurst was pronounced dead at UK Hospital Thursday afternoon.

State Police had previously said Hurst had died Wednesday, but later learned she was still on life support pending organ donation.

This past Friday, Kentucky State Police said a high speed chase started in Mercer County and continued into Anderson County on U.S. 127 until the car crashed into the vehicle Hurst was in at the U.S. 62 intersection.

Investigators say David Henderson was charged with being under the influence and evading police.

According to Henderson’s citation he tested positive for acid after the crash.

Henderson was in court Thursday morning, facing those charges.

According to the Anderson News, Henderson was not granted bond and was given a public defender.

State Police say additional charges are pending now that Hurst has died.

She had just graduated from Anderson County High School this year, according to the school district’s Facebook page.

The district says in its post, “She was a beautiful and talented young lady who was loved by many. We continue to keep her family and friends in our thoughts and prayers during this difficult and sad time.”

Grief counselors are on staff at the high school for students and staff at this time.
