Isaac Ornelas, a 30-year-old Latino, died Thursday, March 18, the day after he was shot by police several times in the 14200 block of Community Street in Panorama City, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

In an LAPD news release, officials said officers had responded to a call for service at a residence in that block about 7:15 p.m. Wednesday.

When officers arrived, they were directed to a detached structure at the back of the house where they encountered Ornelas armed with a semi-automatic handgun. When the suspect reached for his weapon, officers opened gunfire. Ornelas was struck in the upper torso and taken into custody.

Los Angeles Fire Department personnel took Ornelas to a hospital where he died in surgery.

Ornelas was pronounced dead at 12:04 a.m., according to coroner's records.

The LAPD Force Investigation Division is currently investigating the officer-involved shooting.
