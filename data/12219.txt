Payne County District Attorney Tom Lee says two Cushing police officers were justified when they shot and killed an 18-year-old Tulsa man.

Lee said in a news release Thursday that Rabih Ozeir refused the officer's orders to drop a handgun he was carrying and that he was shot when he pointed the gun at the officers on January 10. Ozeir died the following day at a Tulsa hospital.

Authorities have declined to release the names of the officers involved, but say they have been on paid administrative leave.

Cushing police have said the officers were investigating a disturbance call outside of a chiropractic clinic and gym when they encountered Ozeir in a parking lot.
