DES MOINES (AP) - A motorist who fled a routine traffic stop, crashed his car into a tree and then pointed a gun at a police officer while fleeing on foot was shot and killed Monday, police said.

The man was identified as Nathan Vestal, 22, of Des Moines.

The officer had pulled the man over for speeding shortly before 10 a.m. in the northwest part of town, police Sgt. Tony Steverson said. Officer Mark Wessels took the man's driver's license and returned to his cruiser to make a radio check.

When the officer approached the car a second time, the driver sped away with the officer in pursuit.

Vestal crashed his car into another car, but kept going. The car chase ended when he crashed his car into a tree, but Vestal got out and fled on foot. The officer followed.

The suspect turned and pointed a handgun at the officer and shot at least once. The officer in turn fired a shot, hitting Vestal, Steverson said. Vestal was taken to a local hospital, where he died.

Passengers in Vestal's car included his sister, Erica, and Jesse Lee Winders, 23. Both were charged with interfering with police. Erica Vestal was also charged with two counts of criminal mischief and Winders with probation violation.

Wessels was placed on routine administrative leave pending an investigation into the shooting by the Division of Criminal Investigation.
