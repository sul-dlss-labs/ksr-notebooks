A manhunt that started early Wednesday morning in South West Virginia has finally come to an end.

Scott County Virginia Sheriff’s Deputies spent the day searching for 28-year-old Timothy Manuel.

Deputies said they were looking to pull Timothy Manuel over for a suspected DUI Wednesday morning around 8:30 a.m. But, they say he led them on a chase, then he jumped out of the car and fired a gun at deputies.

Officers found ammunition, marijuana and thousands of dollars worth of meth in Manuel’s car.

The Scott County Sherrif’s Department, Virginia State Police, and some members of the Washington County, Va Sheriff’s Department assisted in an over eight hour search,” said Scott County Sheriff Chris Holder.

“We’ve had deputies all over these hills today and at the houses and yards protecting and checking because we knew the suspect was around here. “

Before 6pm Wednesday, Manuel was dead. He was shot by a sheriff’s deputy after the sheriff said Manuel pulled a gun while hiding behind a bush on private property in Hiltons, Virginia.

“This is a sad day,” Holder said. “It’s a bad day that it turned out like this. I hate it but our job is to protect our community and our citizens.”

Holder said in killing Manuel, his officers did what they had to do and he’s proud of their work.

“They’re heroes because they put their life on the line,” Holder said. “And I am so proud of these guys and I’m so thankful that none of them got hurt.”

Sheriff Holder says Timothy Manuel may have been involved in a robbery in Johnson City Wednesday morning, before the first incident in Scott County.

We have reached out to the Johnson City Police Department on this matter and are waiting for more information.
