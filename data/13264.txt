A Redondo Beach man assaulting his mother and dragging her into their house Thursday night was shot to death by police officers when he pulled a knife during a confrontation, police said.

Mitchell Allison, 43, died at County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center shortly after the shooting in the 500 block of Susana Avenue, Redondo Beach police Capt. Jeff Hink said.

A neighbor called police about 11:15 p.m. after hearing a woman screaming and seeing Allison dragging her into the home, Hink said.

Police officers arrived and found his mother, who had escaped outside the residence, Hink said.
