Essex officials have on Monday named the man police officers fatally wounded early Saturday morning after taking his ex-girlfriend hostage and holding her at gunpoint for several hours.

Authorities say Sean Sharpe, 54, of Orange was waiting inside his ex-girlfriend’s home in Newark when she and their 11-year-old daughter returned home Friday night just after 9 p.m.

The woman had an active restraining order against Sharpe, the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office said Monday.

Sharpe forced the woman and his daughter out of the house at gunpoint, prosecutors said, but his daughter was able to escape and call police.

When Newark Police and a SWAT team responded to the call, in the area of Broadway and Irving Street, the young girl was immediately taken into police custody.

Sharpe continued to point his weapon on the woman for more than seven hours while authorities tried to negotiate a surrender with non-lethal methods, prosecutors said.

Just before he was shot, at about 5:30 a.m., Sharpe pointed his gun at his ex-girlfriend’s head and then at police, prosecutors said.

“The investigation reveals that the suspect repeatedly stated he had no intention of surrendering to law enforcement,” Prosecutors said in a statement Monday morning.

Both the girl and her mother escaped physical injury, and the child was not at the scene at the time of the shooting, Lt. Ronald Glover told NJ Advance Media Saturday.

The incident is being investigated by the prosecutor’s Professional Standards Bureau, which investigates all police-involved shootings resulting in injury or death.

The investigation is ongoing.
