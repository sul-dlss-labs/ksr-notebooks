SAN ANTONIO â€“ A San Antonio police officer who shot and killed a suspected car burglar was involved in another fatal officer-involved shooting in June 2013.



Ofc. Christopher Johnson was placed on administrative duty early Thursday after he shot and killed 50-year-old Don Eastman.

Police said Johnson was responding to a call for a car burglary at a parking lot at Nacogdoches and Danbury roads just after midnight. A man matching the description of the suspect ran off.

"(The suspect) stopped, crouched down and all of a sudden, he started firing at the officer with the handgun. The officer returned fire," McManus said.

The man ran and collapsed in a nearby field. Police said their Eagle helicopter found the man's body.

"The suspect had a gun still in his hands," McManus said. "We removed the gun for safety reasons, but he did still have a gun in his hands."

Johnson was involved in the other officer shooting on June 28, 2013.

San Antonio police were called to the 5100 block of Galahad Road for a family disturbance because a suspect, later identified as 32-year-old Christopher Fredette, was acting aggressive towards his parents.

Two officers removed Fredette from the house, while another officer stayed inside to talk with the family.

While the two officers outside attempted to search the suspect, Fredette pulled a gun from his waistband and opened fire, hitting one of the officers in the leg.

Ofc. Johnson was inside the home and heard the shots. He rushed out and fired at least one shot at Fredette, and killed him.

Johnson was placed on administrative duty after that shooting, but later returned to duty.
