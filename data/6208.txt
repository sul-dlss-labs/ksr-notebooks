The results from a Thursday autopsy on Peter Stewart revealed the Hoopa man died from smoke inhalation. Humboldt County Coroner Frank Jager said there were no gunshot wounds or other serious injuries to Stewart’s body.

”His lungs were full of soot,” Jager said.

Stewart, 26, was found dead in a Hoopa home that burned down in the midst of his more than 24-hour standoff with law enforcement earlier this week. He fired shots at law enforcement on two separate occasions Sunday and kept them at bay until the fire that claimed his life broke out in the house Monday afternoon.

Jager said Stewart may have passed out from inhaling carbon monoxide and then succumbed to the smoke. His naked body was found in the shower.

Jager did not immediately know how long Stewart had inhaled the smoke before he died.

Results from a toxicology test are still out.

The cause and origin of the fire are being investigated by the Humboldt County Arson Task Force.

Messages of shock and sadness regarding Stewart’s death have been relayed from Hoopa throughout the week, most reflecting on the boy they saw grow up in the valley.

”He was kind, charming, generous, loving, and all the things a mother wanted in a son,” wrote Barbara Houle in an e-mail. “This boy will stand out, not for the way he died, but for the way he lived, loved and respected others.”
