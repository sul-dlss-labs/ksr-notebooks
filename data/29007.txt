A California Highway Patrol officer was hospitalized and a suspect was dead early Thursday, Oct. 22, after a pursuit of a reported stolen car from Chino ended with a gun battle near Barstow, authorities said.

At around 2:40 a.m., the CHP took over a pursuit on the northbound I-15 in Chino that continued through the Cajon Pass into the Barstow area, law enforcement officials said.

The hour-plus chase ended on the northbound I-15, south of Outlet Center Drive.

“Just before 4 a.m., the pursuit terminated and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” CHP Officer Michael Mumford said in an email. “The suspect and an officer were struck by gunfire.”

The officer’s wounds were believed to be non-life-threatening, the San Bernardino Sheriff’s Department said. It was unclear if he remained hospitalized as of Thursday afternoon.

The suspect, a 35-year-old man, was not identified pending notification of next of kin. A revolver that investigators believe belonged to him was recovered from the scene, theSheriff’s Department said.

The investigation left the northbound lanes of the I-15 closed at Hodge Road for much of the day.
