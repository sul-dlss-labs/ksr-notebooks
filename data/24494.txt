Authorities say 48-year-old Crystal Moore of Findlay died after a police pursuit early this morning.

According to the Findlay Police Department, officers had been contacted by the Crawford County Sheriff's Office to be on the look out for a car that had been involved in a chase in that county. A Findlay police officer spotted the car on main street and activated his lights. Moore took off and police pursued it the vehicle to Mortimer. After crossing some railroad tracks, the car went left of center and hit a house. Fire departments and ambulance personnel discovered that Moore did not survive.

An autopsy is scheduled tomorrow with the Lucas County Coroner.
