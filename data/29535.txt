A Glendale police officer, working with a U.S. Marshal's Task Force, shot and killed an escaped Arizona prison inmate in south Phoenix Tuesday, officials said.

The shooting occurred about 5:30 p.m. in the 2700 Block of East Valencia Drive, near 24th Street and Baseline Road in Phoenix.

Glendale Police Sgt. John Roth said officers and U.S. marshals were searching for the escaped inmate and had set up a perimeter around a house in the area.

As officers attempted to contact the man, he fled through a rear yard and jumped over a back wall, Roth said.

A Glendale K9 unit officer confronted him and ordered him to stop, but the man responded by firing several gunshots at the officer, Roth said.

The officer, who was not hit, returned fire, striking the man multiple times, he said. The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

A Glendale police K9 dog was struck by gunfire during the exchange and transported to an animal hospital for treatment, where he was stable late Tuesday, Roth added.

Roth said the 23-year-old man had escaped from the Arizona Department of Corrections in February. His name was not released.

Multiple police agencies still were at the scene and the area was closed to traffic into Tuesday night as the investigation continued.

The shooting was the 62nd involving law-enforcement in Maricopa County this year, and the 31st resulting in a death, according to a count maintained by The Arizona Republic.
