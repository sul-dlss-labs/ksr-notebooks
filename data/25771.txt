A 61-year-old man died Sunday morning after a barricade situation in the Arcadia Terrace neighborhood on the North Side.

Officers were called at 11:05 p.m. Saturday night for a man threatening suicide in the 2400 block of Bryn Mawr, Chicago police said. When they arrived, the man was inside an apartment and implied he had a weapon.

SWAT teams arrived just after midnight and Bryn Mawr was closed off from Lincoln Avenue to Artesian as the situation unfolded for the next few hours, police said.

The man was pronounced dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound at 3:30 a.m., police said. The scene was cleared and a death investigation is underway.
