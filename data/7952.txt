A man known to police only as a minor offender was shot and killed March 18 in St. Marcus Cemetery after he charged St. Louis County Police officers with an ax.

Mark Alan Palmateer, 45, of the 5100 block of Heege Road in Affton was shot and killed by two officers about 11:30 p.m. at the cemetery, 7901 Gravois Road, St. Louis County Police Sgt. Tracy Panus said.

Police received a phone call around 11:15 p.m. from Palmateer's wife alleging a domestic assault and then a second call from a suicide hotline concerning him.

Officers, using their patrol care spotlights, found him about 11:30 p.m. walking in the cemetery. Palmateer, carrying the hatchet and a long barbecue fork, approached the two officers.

Both officers are members of the Crisis Intervention team at the Affton Precinct and are trained to deal with people in crisis situations, Panus said.

When they ordered him to drop the weapons he charged at them. Both officers fired, killing him, Panus said.

The officers, with six and seven years experience, were placed on paid administrative leave while the department investigates, Panus said.

It appears the officers followed department procedures during the incident, Panus added.

Palmateer was not known to the two Crisis Intervention officers, but he did have an extensive record of minor criminal offenses, such as property code violations, traffic and driving offenses and minor drug charges, Panus said.
