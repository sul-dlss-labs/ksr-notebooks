A federal judge dismissed a civil lawsuit Monday against two Dallas police officers who fatally shot a mentally ill man holding a screwdriver.

The family of 38-year-old Jason Harrison filed a federal lawsuit against the city and the officers alleging Harrison's constitutional rights were violated when police responded to a 911 call at his home in June 2014.

Officers shot Harrison when he came out of the Red Bird-area house holding the screwdriver and failed to heed their commands to drop it.

A Dallas County grand jury declined last April to indict officers John Rogers and Andrew Hutchins on criminal charges in connection with Harrison's death. Rogers and Hutchins responded to Harrison's home on Glencairn Drive after his mother called for help dealing with her schizophrenic son.

Harrison followed his mother out the door of their home holding a screwdriver, and the officers ordered him to drop it. A police body camera video showed the confrontation quickly escalate. It was the first time a body camera had captured a fatal police shooting in Dallas. After the officers fired five times on Harrison, his mother was heard screaming.

"Oh they killed my child," she yelled repeatedly.

U.S. District Judge David C. Godbey ruled Monday that the officers did not violate Harrison's rights when they shot him. He wrote in his ruling that the body camera video showed that the officers told Harrison to drop the screwdriver and he lunged at the officers, putting them at risk.

"The death of Jason Harrison is tragic," Godbey wrote. "Not every tragedy is a violation of constitutional rights, however."

The Harrison family's attorney, Geoff Henley, said the family was disappointed by Godbey's decision. They hoped they would have their day in court in front a jury, Henley said.

“Anybody who loses a loved one wants to be made whole,” he said. "The Harrisons want to be vindicated.You see your loved one get shot on your front porch, you want to be heard. You want for people to take action.”

The family did not specify how much money they wanted in the suit, but Henley said they also hoped the lawsuit would cause changes in how Dallas police handle calls regarding the mentally ill. Henley said the officers should have given Harrison more space.

"What you don't want to do is make the individual feel cornered," he said.

Dallas police officials declined to comment on the judge's decision.

After Harrison was shot, one of the officers is heard on the recording saying, "He was in the doorway. He had the screwdriver. We had this behind us so we had to shoot."

The video does not show what was behind the officers at the time of the shooting.

The judge's decision Monday does not put an end to the Harrison family's lawsuit against the city, which First Assistant City Attorney Chris Bowers said he also wants to see dropped.

"We believe the claims against the city have no merit," Bowers said. He added that he believes Godbey made the right decision.

"We're pleased with the judge's ruling, and we think the judge is correct on the law," he said. "If you've seen the video, things happened extremely quickly in the video."
