Three men were killed early Saturday evening after a La Crosse County Deputy attempted to stop their vehicle in Mindoro for a traffic violation, according to the La Crosse County Sheriff's Department.

The accident happened at about 4:55 p.m. on County Highway T, two miles west of Hwy. 108 in the town of Farmington. A deputy attempted to pull the vehicle over for unnecessary acceleration when the driver sped up in order to elude the deputy, according to authorities. The vehicle was pursued for about two and a half miles until the deputy lost sight of it until coming upon the crash.

Witnesses and the deputy say the patrol car was nearly a mile behind the suspect vehicle at the time of the crash.

All three occupants were ejected after the vehicle rolled several times and were pronounced dead at the scene. Names of the deceased will be released pending notification of family. All are men from the area in their 20s, according to Sgt. Brian Wierzbicki with the La Crosse County Sheriff's Department.

The Wisconsin State Patrol is investigating the crash.
