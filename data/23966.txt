A man has died from a gunshot wound after reportedly pointing a handgun at law enforcement in Childress County following a pursuit through multiple Texas counties.

The incident began around 12:05 a.m. Friday when a male driving a 2009 Mercedes passenger car failed to stop for a traffic violation.

A Donley County Sheriff's deputy tried to initiate the traffic stop, but the driver evaded law enforcement south on U.S. Highway 287 through Donley and Hall counties.

Upon entering Childress County, the Childress Police Department was able to deploy spikes successfully to disable the vehicle.

The suspect then fled the scene on foot and continued to lead law enforcement officials on a chase.

Childress officers and deputies were able to make contact with the suspect a short time later. When the suspect reportedly pointed a handgun at the officers, they shot him.

The man was taken to a local hospital, where he later died from his injuries. His identity was not released Friday morning.

The Texas Department of Public Safety Texas rangers were called in to assist Donley and Childress county sheriff's offices and the Childress Police Department with the investigation of the officer-involved shooting.

DPS officials said the investigation was ongoing.

Texas rangers are also looking into the death of 36-year-old Heath Wayne Hodges, of Iowa Park, during an officer-involved shooting in Foard County.

No other information has been released by DPS officials about the investigation, which they said was ongoing.
