ORIGINAL STORY:

SALEM, Ind. — State Police say a man has died in a police-action shooting in southern Indiana.

Sgt. Carey Huls says a Salem police officer shot and killed the man Wednesday afternoon near the Washington County Fairgrounds. State police later identified the deceased as 53-year-old Mark A. Naugle of Scottsburg.

After someone reported a suspicious person walking on the property, two Salem police officers spotted Naugle, who was standing in a creek that borders the property. ISP said Naugle approached the officers with a hammer and refused to drop it or stop his approach; at least one of the officers fired their weapon, killing Naugle.

Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure in such cases. The officers have not yet been identified.

Indiana State Police said the investigation is ongoing, including an autopsy. Once the investigation is complete, the Washington County Prosecutor’s Office will review it for a charging decision.
