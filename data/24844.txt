Hamden police stopped chasing a reckless driver into New Haven well before the driver crashed and caused his passenger to die.

So New Haven State’s Attorney Patrick J. Griffin has concluded after his office and the Connecticut State Police Collision Analysis & Reconstruction Squad conducted a ​“thorough review of witness statements, surveillance videos and physical evidence” related to the Aug. 17, 2018 issue.

Griffin’s office issued a press release Tuesday afternoon announcing the results of the review.

It is now practice for the state’s attorney’s office to conduct independent investigations of local police pursuits ​“that result in serious physical injury or death.”

Like the one Aug. 17.

The incident started in Hamden. The cops tried to stop the driver of ​“a stolen motor vehicle that was observed at the scene of a burglary within their town,” according to the Tuesday release. The driver refused to stop; ​“a brief pursuit ensued” into New Haven.

The cops ​“lost sight” of the car as the driver traveled near Barnes and Quinnipiac Avenues. The driver lost control of his vehicle and struck a tree.

A 24-year-old passenger, Jarelle Gibbs, later died as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident.

The driver has been charged with two felonies— manslaughter with grave risk of death and third-degree larceny — along with a misdemeanor larceny charge, reckless driving, engaging police in pursuit, operating a motor vehicle without a license, and possession of less than 1/2 ounce of cannabis. He has not yet entered a plea, according to the state judicial database; his next scheduled court date is Sept. 13.
