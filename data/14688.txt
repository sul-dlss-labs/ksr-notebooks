One man was killed and another man was arrested following a confrontation with officers that ended in gunfire early Saturday in San Bernardino, authorities said.

The incident occurred in the 800 block of North Davidson Avenue (map) at around 3:30 a.m. while officers with the Fontana Police Department were investigating a shooting that had left a 37-year-old man injured the night before, according to a news release from the San Bernardino Police Department.

Four officers were inside their vehicle when they were approached by two men who appeared to have been armed. One of the men, identified as 22-year-old James Moala Kofu, allegedly pointed a sawed off small caliber rifle at the officers, the release stated.

Fearing for their lives, the officers fired at the two men, hitting Kofu, according to the release.

Kofu was pronounced dead at the scene.

A weapon was located near his body, police said.

The second man, identified as 35-year-old Antonio Valentino Ramirez, fled the scene on foot, according to the release.

Two hours later, officers found Ramirez at a home on Davidson Avenue that they had been watching following the Fontana shooting, the release stated.

Ramirez, who was not injured in the officer-involved shooting, was taken into custody without incident.

He was later identified by police as the suspect in the Fontana shooting, according to San Bernardino police.

Ramirez was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in connection with both shootings, the release said.

Anyone with information about the officer-involved shooting was asked to contact Sgt. Gary Robertson at 909-841-5361 or Detective John Munoz at 909-384-5630.
