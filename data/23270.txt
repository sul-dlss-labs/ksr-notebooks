PARKER, Colo. -- Parker Police are investigating after a suspect was fatally shot by officers Saturday evening.

The shooting took place near an apartment complex at 10841 Twenty Mile Road just after 10 p.m.

Police said they were tipped off to a stolen car out of Mesa County by residents in the complex.

The suspect, identified as Michael Wayne Marin, 35, of Montrose, reportedly started knocking on several apartment doors before people in the complex called police as they did not recognize him. It's unclear why Marin was knocking on doors.

After police arrived, the suspect and police started firing at each other. Marin was hit and officers began CPR, but he later died at a nearby hospital.

The officers involved in the shooting are now on administrative leave per department policy. No officers were injured in the shooting.

A handgun police said Marin used was recovered on scene. A heavy gun safe was also found inside of a stolen vehicle.

Marin was wanted by Mesa County Sheriff's Office deputies in connection with three recent fast-food robberies. He had warrants out for this arrest from Mesa County, Grand Junction and the Town of Delta.

Police told Denver7 they are not searching for more suspects.
