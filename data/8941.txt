MOBILE, Ala. -- Mobile police Sunday identified the two men killed Saturday night

.

Police spokesman Officer Christopher Levy said the driver, 34-year-old Eric Lekendrick Manuel, and a passenger, 31-year-old Wykyim Jowers, were killed when the car they were in slammed into a power pole and a tree and burned on Old Shell road just west of Item Avenue.

A third passenger was ejected from the white four-door Cadillac sedan and hospitalized at University of South Alabama Medical Center with serious but not life-threatening injuries, Levy said.

Police did not release the injured man's name.

Levy said an officer spotted the Cadillac with no lights on about 8:20 p.m. and tried to stop the car at Dauphin and Upham streets, but the driver sped north on Upham Street and then west on Old Shell Road.

Shortly after the officer lost sight of the vehicle on Old Shell Road, he found it wrecked in front of Coastal Insulation at 2609 Old Shell Road, about nine blocks from where he tried to stop it.

Levy said it is still unclear why the men sped off. A check of online court records did not reveal any outstanding warrants against either of the men who were killed.

District Chief Douglas Cooper of the

said the car burned after impact, which one witness said caused a transformer on the power pole to explode.
