A 36-year-old man who died shortly after he was struck by a Birmingham police stun gun suffered a fatal drug overdose, authorities announced today.

Danny Morel Cupps Jr. was pronounced dead July 12 at St. Vincent's Hospital. Birmingham police arrested Cupps after they found him burglarizing a home. They said he was growling when officers used a Taser on him, and then took him into custody.

Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates today said the manner of Cupps' death has been ruled accidental, and the cause of death was methamphetamine toxicity.

The incident began shortly after 3:30 p.m. that day at a home in the 5200 block of Lewisburg Road. Birmingham police spokesman Lt. Sean Edwards gave this account of what happened: Birmingham Officers responded to a burglary in progress in the 5200 block of Lewisburg Road about 3:35 p.m. When they arrived, the officers met the homeowner who said he heard glass breakage and someone yelling and growling in his basement.

Additional officers arrived and told the homeowner to go next door for his safety. As officers walked around the house, they observed several windows broken and they entered the home. Once inside, they saw a white male wearing only shorts and wrapped up in material that looked like the air conditioner duct work.

"Officers immediately gave the suspect verbal commands but he did not comply,'' Edwards said at the time. "Officers Tased the suspect several times but suspect continued to resist. Officers closed in on the suspect and handcuffed him."

Cupps was taken outside to await medics. "During the entire incident, the suspect acted extremely irritated and growled at officers,'' Edwards said.

Cupps, who was from Sterrett, was charged with burglary in Walker County in 2011. That case had not yet been adjudicated, according to court records. In 2005, he was convicted of cocaine possession and received a one-year suspended sentence.
