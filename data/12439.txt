Northeast Quadrant Advanced Life Support, also known as NEQALS or NEQ, held its annual Board of Directors elections in January. Its 2013 officers are: Robert Meddaugh, president of the board, S. Ahmed Mustafa, vice president; Bruce Rolland, treasurer, and Elizabeth Montgomery, secretary.

Two new members — Bruce Talbert and George Glessner III — from the Webster community joined the board, and will be serving with Richard Prinzing and Chris DeGroff.

Jerry Fedele, NEQALS Director of Operations, reported that in 2012, NEQALS responded to 2,499 calls for service. Included in those 2,499 calls, NEQ paramedics delivered one baby, responded to 51 cardiac arrest calls, and recorded 17 cardiac arrest saves.

"A save rate of almost 33 percent is remarkable, and a true testament to the fantastic EMS system we have in our community," Mustafa said. He is also an active Paramedic with NEQ.

"We are fortunate that in much of our response area, we get active participation from police officers, first responders and basic life support from several fire departments,” Meddaugh added. “Saving a life requires fast response and a well coordinated team to give a patient the best chance of survival and recovery and we are proud of our 2012 results.”

NEQALS is the primary Advanced Life Support, or ALS, for the northeast part of Monroe County and northwestern part of Wayne County, including the towns of Webster, Penfield and Ontario.

This month, NEQALS will launch its 2013 capital campaign to raise funds to offset the unbudgeted cost of purchasing three advanced cardiac monitor/defibrillators at a cost of $33,000 each.

In April 2013, NEQALS will celebrate is 25th anniversary at a gala event where County Executive Maggie Brooks is slated to deliver the keynote address.
