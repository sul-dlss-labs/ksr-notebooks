Bodhi Wilson Dean Phelps

UPDATE: Gresham police release names of officers involved in fatal shooting of Fairview man

Police on Wednesday identified the man who was fatally shot by officers after allegedly assaulting and forcing a woman into a car in a Gresham.

Bodhi Wilson Dean Phelps of Fairview, 22, died as a result of gunfire, Gresham police said Wednesday in a news release. Witnesses said he refused repeated orders to drop his knives.

Police responded to the 800 block of Southeast 190th Avenue shortly after 3 a.m. Tuesday on reports of a man assaulting and abducting a woman. Witnesses told police that Phelps forced a 25-year-old woman into a sedan. He drove away before police got to the scene.

Witnesses said the woman was screaming and banging the inside of the sedan, which was stopped in the 18900 block of Southeast Grant Street.

She also called 911, police said, and reported Phelps assaulted her. He was outside the car at that time.

Phelps ran from officers when they arrived and didn't stop when they told him to. Two officers ran after Phelps, who brandished a pair of knives.

People told police they heard police tell Phelps multiple times to "drop the knife" and later heard gunshots.

Phelps had three outstanding warrants: a felony warrant for heroin possession and probation violations for identity theft and heroin possession, police said.

The case is under investigation and will later be heard by a grand jury. Police didn't identify the officers involved in the incident.

Detectives with the county's Major Crimes Team ask any witnesses who haven't yet spoken with police to come forward. Witnesses can reach detectives at 503-618-2719.
