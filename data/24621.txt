DAYTON, Ohio (AP) — Authorities say a man accused of leading a state trooper on a chase ending in a crash that killed the man’s passenger has been indicted in Ohio on charges including aggravated vehicular homicide.

The Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office said in a release Thursday that a State Highway Patrol trooper in Dayton attempted to stop a car driven by 38-year-old Thurston Melson in July 2018, when Melson drove away quickly. The prosecutor’s office release says Melson lost control of his vehicle and hit a pole.

Melson’s passenger, 35-year-old Ebony Radford, died at the scene.

The prosecutor said Melson was indicted Thursday on charges that also include driving under the influence of marijuana metabolite and driving under the influence of alcohol.

Court records do not show an attorney for Melson.
