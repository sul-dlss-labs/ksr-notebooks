MEDFORD -- A grand jury has found that last month's fatal shooting of an apparently mentally ill man by seven Medford, Oregon, police officers was justified.

The Medford Mail Tribune reports that the investigation showed the seven officers fired 62 rounds in about six seconds on March 17 after 49-year-old Andrew Charles Shipley fired at them. An autopsy showed that five to seven handgun shots and seven to 12 rifle shots hit Shipley.

The county grand jury reached its decision Wednesday.

Authorities say Shipley's mental condition had been declining and a girlfriend was trying to evict him and get him some help.

Officers had been communicating with the man during a 19-hour standoff at the home before the shooting. Officers testified they heard a shot fired in the home on the morning of March 17. Investigators believe that shot killed the girlfriend's dog.

Testimony showed that about three minutes later, Shipley partially raised the garage door and, while lying prone on the garage floor, aimed a hunting rifle at police and fired. They returned fire.
