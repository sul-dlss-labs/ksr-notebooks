A drug suspect apparently choked to death on a bag of cocaine during a struggle with Bronx cops, officials said Thursday.

Cops saw Jose Muniz, 52, who has a long rap sheet, involved in some sort of drug transaction at Jerome Ave. and E. 213th St., at 10 p.m. Wednesday, NYPD Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said. It wasn't clear whether Muniz was buying or selling.

When cops approached, Muniz ducked into a bodega, Kelly said.

"We believe (Muniz) took a golf ball-sized packet of cocaine and put it into his mouth," Kelly said. "There was a struggle."

Police sources said cops pepper-sprayed Muniz and at some point he started choking and having difficulty breathing. The officers used chest compressions on him and the Emergency Medical Service responded to the scene.

An EMS crew pulled the bag of drugs from his throat while en route to North Central Bronx Hospital, but doctors were unable to save him. Muniz died at the hospital at 10:50 p.m.

Internal Affairs is investigating the incident, which was caught on video, Kelly said.

"When you look at the video, there were no blows struck," Kelly said. "There was wrestling, if you will, and also pepper spray was used."

A law enforcement source said Muniz had 23 arrests on his record, including a number for drugs, plus others for burglary and grand larceny. He served time in federal prison for a gun conviction. While in prison, he was busted for heroin, the source said. Muniz, who lived in the Bronx, also had nine sealed arrests, mostly for drugs.
