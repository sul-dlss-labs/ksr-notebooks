BARRY COUNTY, MI -- A drunken driver who caused a fatal crash while fleeing police in Barry County will spend at least seven years in prison.

Matthew Nosanov, 20, was sentenced Thursday, April 2, to seven to 15 years in prison. He pleaded no contest to operating while intoxicated causing death and fleeing and eluding police causing death for the June 28 crash that killed Geovanni Mazariegos Ramirez, 24.

A no contest plea is not an admission of guilt but is treated as such for sentencing purposes.

Barry County sheriff's authorities said Nosanov was driving on M-37 near Adams Road when he drove up behind a deputy's vehicle at what appeared to be a high rate of speed about 3:45 a.m.

The deputy tried to stop the vehicle, but Nosanov fled west on Adams Road. The pursuit reached speeds around 90 mph.

Nosanov drove through the intersection of Bass and Patterson Roads without stopping and struck Ramirez' vehicle broadside.

Nosanov was thrown from his vehicle and critically injured.

Nosanov, of Middleville, was ordered to pay $12,600 in restitution for funeral and other expenses for Ramirez' family.
