THE HOUSE AND SENATE Beacon Hill Roll Call records the votes of local representatives and local senators on two roll calls from the week of July 1-5.

$34 BILLION FISCAL 2014 STATE BUDGET (H 3538) House 124-29, Senate 36-3, approved and sent to Gov. Deval Patrick an estimated $34 billion state budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2013. The price tag is up $1.5 billion from last year's $32.5 billion package. The budget is depending on a $500 million plus tax package that has been approved by the Legislature but has not yet been signed by the governor.

Supporters said the budget is a fiscally responsible and balanced one that funds important programs to the best of the state's ability during this difficult economy.

Opponents said the budget is excessive and also relies on a $500 million plus tax hike. Some noted that the package does not include sufficient reform of the welfare system to reduce fraud and ensure that electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards are used only for necessities and by those qualify for them.

A "Yes" vote is for the budget. A "No" vote is against it.

$134 MILLION FISCAL 2013 SUPPLEMENTAL BUDGET (H 3539) House 153-0, Senate 39-0, approved a $134 million supplemental budget designed to close out the books on fiscal 2013, which ended on June 30. The measure requires photo identification on all EBT cards used by welfare recipients.

Other provisions include $55.7 million to cover the remainder of snow and ice costs from last winter; $500,000 to fund Welcome Home bonuses for soldiers; one-time reimbursement reserve for cities and towns facing unanticipated costs related to extreme weather including communities impacted by Hurricane Irene; $200,000 to establish a reserve fund to provide for home modifications for victims of the Boston Marathon bombings and funding to ensure the family of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier is eligible for Line of Duty benefits.

Supporters said the package is fiscally responsible and that it funds necessary programs including several which are running out of money.

ALSO UP ON BEACON HILL

GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATIVE LEADERS CLASH ON TAXES Gov. Patrick returned the transportation financing bill, including its $500 million plus tax hikes, to the Legislature with an amendment. The bill includes a 3-cent-per-gallon increase in the state's current 21-cent-per-gallon gas tax, which, beginning in 2015, would also be indexed to inflation; a $1 hike in the current $2.51-per-package cigarette tax; an increase in the tax on cigars and smokeless tobacco; a change in the way utilities are classified for tax purposes; a new 6.25 percent sales tax on computer system design services as well as services to modify prewritten software; and reinstatement of tolls at exits 1 through 6 on the Massachusetts Turnpike in Western Massachusetts.

Patrick's amendment would impose an additional gas tax hike, estimated at between 3 or 4 cents per gallon, in 2017 if the tolls from Newton to the New York border come down as planned, eliminating $135 million in tax revenue. Senate President Therese Murray and House Speaker Robert DeLeo both oppose the additional hike, which basically means it is "dead on arrival."

MORE HEARINGS SCHEDULED Here are some upcoming hearings at the State House at which the public may weigh in on proposed laws.

SENIOR CITIZENS SAFETY ZONE (S 77) Room A-2 on July 18 at 10 a.m. The Committee on Community Development and Small Businesses. Allows cities and towns to double speeding fines in areas adjacent to nursing homes, assisted living facilities, hospitals and senior housing and community centers.

BAN SEXUAL ORIENTATION CONVERSION THERAPY (H 154) Room B-1 on July 16 at 1 p.m. The Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities. Prohibits psychiatrists and other mental health professionals from providing conversion therapy to lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender minors under 18 designed to change their sexual orientation or gender identity. Supporters of the ban say there is evidence this type of therapy can pose significant risks of self-destructive behavior and argued there is no sound evidence that it works.

Other proposals on the committee's agenda include a student loan program providing up to $1,800 per year to direct care human service workers to help pay any of their outstanding college loans (S 22); mandating that a female employee on maternity leave for the adoption of a child be entitled to the same benefits offered by her employer as one on leave for the birth of a child (S 58); and creating a pilot program to provide a one-time $10,000 low-interest loan to 30 individuals to assist them in the payment of expenses directly resulting from their child's terminal illness (H 95).

NO ROBOCALLS TO CELL PHONES (S 131) Room A-1 on July 16 at 1 p.m. Committee on Consumer Protection and Professional Licensure. Prohibits robocalls to cell phones and other mobile electronic devices. The measure exempts messages from school districts to students, parents or employees; from companies advising employees of work schedules; from correctional facilities advising victims of paroles and furloughs of offenders; and from municipalities and state government. It also would fine companies up to $10,000 if they make a prohibited robocall and allow individuals who are called to sue a company for $10,000 in damages. Last year the House approved a similar bill but it died in the Senate.

Other measures on the committee's agenda include making all faxes and e-mails confidential without the requirement of a confidentiality statement (S 108); requiring all pre-recorded telephone telemarketing calls to residents and businesses to include an option allowing the person or business to be removed from any future call list (H 251); and allowing the sale of alcohol at continuing care communities, retirement communities and assisted living facilities (H 253).

STUDENTS MUST ATTEND NUTRITION CLASS (S 242) Room A-1 on September 12 at 10 a.m. The Committee on Children, Families and Persons with Disabilities. Requires all public school students in grades 1 to 9 to attend a weekly class dedicated to nutrition education and physical fitness guidelines. The class would include instruction on fat content awareness, cholesterol and carbohydrate counts, organic foods awareness, kosher food benefits, the benefits of dietary fiber, general nutritional health guidelines and the dangers of fast food establishments.

Other proposals subject to the hearing require all school coaches to complete a course in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) from the American Heart Association, American Red Cross or other state-approved agency (S 231); provide 50 percent matching grants to cities and towns for the purchase of automated external defibrillators for use in schools, senior centers and senior housing complexes (S 251); require all public high school students to take a course in the use of CPR and automatic external defibrillators as a prerequisite for graduation (S 266); encourage but does not require all schools to teach each student the basic facts about skin cancer and the dangers of natural sunburns and tanning devices (S 279); and require schools to allow students with life-threatening allergies to possess and administer epinephrine to themselves. Epinephrine is injected to counteract allergic reactions to food and other sources.

The measure also requires schools to maintain a stock supply of epinephrine to be administered in the event of an emergency.

Supporters said that epinephrine, available in an easy-to-carry container that looks like a pen, can be used to ease a child's allergic reaction and could save lives if the allergy is life threatening.

HOW LONG WAS LAST WEEK'S SESSION? During the week of July 1-5, the House met for a total of two hours and 59 minutes while the Senate met for a total of three hours and eight minutes.
