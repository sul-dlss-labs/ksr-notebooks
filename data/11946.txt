A man believed to have been trespassing at a Salem apartment complex died Saturday night after he was shot with a Taser as Salem police officers tried to arrest him.

Gregory Rold, 37, died at Salem Hospital shortly before 9:30 p.m., Lt. Dave Okada of the Salem Police said today.

Officers were called to an apartment in the 1200 block of Royvonne Avenue Southeast in Salem about 7:38 p.m. following a report of a man who was trespassing. They encountered Rold, who Okada said "violently" resisted arrest.

That prompted officers to shoot him with a Taser and strike him with their batons. After he was handcuffed, officers realized Rold was unconscious. According to Okada, they immediately called for medical help and gave emergency aid to Rold. Rold was then taken to Salem Hospital where he died.

Okada said the police involved were officers Jacob Pratt, Eric Brown, Adam Waite, and Corporal Darron Mumey. He said Pratt was injured during the altercation and was treated at Silverton Hospital. All four officers were placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure when officers are involved in extremely traumatic events.

The Oregon State Police officers are investigating, also standard procedure.
