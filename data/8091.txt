Suspected rapist shot and killed by West Des Moines police

Police shot and killed a man in a West Des Moines townhouse Tuesday night. He was reportedly a suspect in a series of home break-ins and at least three sexual assaults in West Des Moines and Waukee over the past several months.

West Des Moines Police Lieutenant Jeff Miller says it happened about 7 P.M. in the Village at Glen Oaks, a gated townhouse complex. “Officers from our department attempted to serve a search warrant,” Lieutenant Miller says.

“They knocked on the door several times, announced themselves, as is protocol. No one answered. The door was unlocked, they walked inside, again, announcing themselves. The subject approached them, pointing a firearm at them and the officers shot the subject.”

The man was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Miller says the man was a suspect in a string of violent crimes in the metro area dating back to December. “The suspect broke into the residence through a window, broke the window, got inside and sexually assaulted a young girl and then physically attacked the mother,” Miller says.

“We had a couple other incidents in West Des Moines where he got in and was either scared off or in the process of entering the apartment was scared off.” In one recent incident, a man who lived in the home was hit over the head with a hammer.

In all, Miller says the suspect is linked to six home invasions and eight assaults, including three sexual assaults. The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is looking into the fatal shooting.
