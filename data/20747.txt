Phoenix Police Department identified 34-year-old Jesus Ramon Deltoro as the man shot and killed by an officer Friday night after police said he fled during a traffic stop and later charged at them in his vehicle.

A 38-year-old male officer with 17 years' of experience in the department suffered a broken foot when Deltoro's car crashed into his cruiser.

Phoenix police officers saw a black Chevy Camaro engage in a traffic violation shortly before 10 p.m. Friday near 28th and Monroe streets, according to Phoenix police.

"The officers attempted to stop the vehicle, but it fled from them at a high rate of speed," said Sgt. Alan Pfohl, Phoenix police spokesman.

Pfohl said three officers circulated in the area looking for the car, and spotted it near 21st and Adams streets.

The driver attempted to flee, crashing into a fence, a tree and the officer's vehicle, then accelerated the Camaro in the direction of the other officers in the roadway, Pfohl said.

A 33-year-old male officer with 13 years of service with Phoenix police fired his weapon, and Deltoro was pronounced dead at the scene.

The third officer involved, who sustained no injuries, was a 44-year-old man with 12 years of service with Phoenix police, Pfohl said.
