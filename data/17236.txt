SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) -- Three people are dead after a brief pursuit ending in a fiery collision Saturday night closed a busy intersection, according to CHP spokesman Vu Williams.

Around 9:20 p.m. officers responded to reports of a vehicle doing doughnuts near the intersection of Brannan and 9th Streets, Williams said.

According to CHP officials, as officers approached, the vehicle sped off running many red lights before colliding with a taxicab.

Williams said the suspect vehicle burst into flames and as fire crews worked to extinguish the fire, found two bodies inside.

"The whole car burst into such intense flames -- bang -- nobody could survive," said witness Neal Taylor. "There was no movement or sounds of any people ... so we couldn't help them. There was nothing we could do."

A third body was found ejected from a vehicle near the crash site, however Williams said they were uncertain on whether the body came from the suspect vehicle or not.

The taxi driver sustained mild to moderate injures and was taken to the hospital for further treatment, according to CHP officials.

The suspect vehicle is described as a white 4-door Chevy.

CHP officials said the intersection would remain closed for several hours as crews worked to clean the area.
