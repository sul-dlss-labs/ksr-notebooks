Police have released the name of a Tennessee man killed in an officer-involved shooting on West 19th Street in Hopkinsville on October 24th.

Hopkinsville Police say they stopped to check on 44-year-old Arthur Hunt of Hendersonville in a vehicle parked on the side of the road near South Main Street.

During the stop, Hunt was reportedly found to have active warrants out of Florida involving a DUI crash, he fought with the officer then pointed a gun at him before fleeing into a vacant apartment.

Law enforcement blocked off several roads in the area and tried to make contact with Hunt to have him exit the building at the intersection of West 19th Street and South Main Street. Police then shot tear gas into the apartment.

Police say they found Hunt in the attic between two walls after a 6-hour standoff and used tear gas again. He then pointed a gun at them, and officers fired shots killing him.

At the time of the shooting, Hopkinsville Police Chief Clayton Sumner said he was confident the officers did what they were supposed to do and followed the law. They were taken off regular patrol duty by Sumner per departmental policy.

Kentucky State Police continues to investigate the incident.
