JOLIET â€” A man slain in a shootout with Joliet police after an attempted robbery Sunday has been identified as a convicted sex offender who was on parole for an armed robbery conviction, officials said.

Darrin L. Davis, 38, of Joliet, was shot by police and died early Monday in a local hospital after trying to hold up the Walgreen store with his brother, authorities said.

No charges were filed Tuesday against Davis' brother, who remained in critical condition at Loyola University Medical Center after being wounded in the shootout outside Walgreens at 358 E. Cass St., police said.

Joliet Police Chief David Gerdes said a department review of the shooting is expected by next week. After a 911 call, police found two men brandishing handguns in the store about 11:40 p.m. Sunday, Gerdes said. Two shots were fired in the store, one from an intruder and one from police, he said.

The men fled out the back, where more police met them and the gunfire resumed, Gerdes said.
