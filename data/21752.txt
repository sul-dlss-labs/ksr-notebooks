Mr. Church jumped out of the car and ran nearly three blocks into Trenton. The officers ran after him and the chase ended on Vroom Street, where he shot Officer Donovan in the groin and one of the officers shot Mr. Church in the head, the authorities said. "We do not know where the shot came from at this point," said Casey DeBlasio, a spokeswoman for the Mercer County prosecutor's office. She said "there were other police officers that had fired" at Mr. Church.

No charges were filed against the woman driving the S.U.V.

Mr. Church spent 8 of the past 10 years in prison. He was sentenced to serve a seven-year term in 1995 after being convicted on three charges of aggravated assault and a drug-related offense, according to the New Jersey Department of Corrections.

In April 2004, he returned to prison on another charge, which authorities did not have available last night, but was released last November to a halfway house in Camden, where he served the first months of his parole, a department spokesman said.

Before joining the Hamilton Township force in April, Officer Donovan served in the Navy for four years.

He is also a volunteer firefighter at De Cou Hose Company in Trenton and has a 3-month-old son, according to another firefighter in the company, Kinte Holt, 28.
