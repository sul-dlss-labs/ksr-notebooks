Authorities have released the name of a man who authorities say took his own life during an hours-long standoff Wednesday night in east Birmingham.

The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office identified the man as George Anthony Dowdell. He was 38.

The ordeal began about 6 p.m. when police responded to a call of a person shot in the 600 block of Brussels Circle. When they arrived, they found a woman suffering from a gunshot wound to her foot.

The woman was taken to UAB Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries. Police said the shooting apparently stemmed from a domestic incident.

The suspect – now identified as Dowdell – fled into an apartment in the 500 block of Brussels Circle, where he barricaded himself. Court records list Dowdell’s address as 507 Brussels Circle.

When officers set up a perimeter around the apartment, said Sgt. Rod Mauldin, the suspect fired multiple shots at officers. Police issued an emergency call for all assistance need, and officers from throughout the city responded to the scene.

Mauldin said officers did not return fire.

During the four-hour standoff, police secured warrants against Dowdell assault and attempted murder of a police officer.

When the standoff stretched on with no communication from the subject, Mauldin said, “We deemed it was time for us to go in.”

No one else was found inside the apartment. Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service pronounced Dowdell dead on the scene at 10:10 p.m.
