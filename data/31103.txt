BRUNSWICK COUNTY, N.C. â€” A suspect is dead after allegedly shooting at sheriff's deputies in southeastern North Carolina Sunday evening, according to the Brunswick County Sheriff's Office.

Deputies responded to a domestic call at about 6 p.m. Sunday on Wanets Landing Road in Leland, North Carolina, sheriff's office spokeswoman Emily Flax said. The shooting happened in a largely rural area outside Wilmington.

In a 911 call released by the county, a woman said her husband, Michael Beck, 57, shot at her twice with a .45 handgun. She told the 911 operator that he shot at her, and a bullet hit her chair right near her head.

"Please send someone quick because I'm afraid he's going to try to shoot me again," she said on the call.

"They need to proceed with caution when they show up because he is ready to shoot anyone," the woman warned the 911 operator. "He will shoot at whoever comes at him. He will shoot at the officers."



"Gunfire was exchanged between deputies and a male subject," Flax said in an email to Spectrum News 1. The man was killed, she said.

"All deputies are OK," Flax said.

The 911 log shows deputies reported Beck had a gun in his hand and shots were fired. The record show Beck may have had a self-inflicted gunshot wound in addition to gunshot wounds from deputies.



Brunswick County Sheriff John Ingram and District Attorney Jon David requested the State Bureau of Investigation investigate the shooting, she said. It is standard protocol for the SBI to investigate shootings involving law enforcement.
