The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation (OSBI) is investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting reported Sunday night in Noble County, Okla., about 100 miles south of Wichita.

The OSBI identifies the man killed in the shooting as 39-year-old Shane Wentling. Monday morning, Eyewitness News learned Wentling is from Wichita.

The series of events leading up to Wentling's death started with an incident at a Wichita store. The OSBI says Wentling pulled out a gun when a store clerk refused to sell him beer. The OSBI says he left cash, then left the store.

While driving on a Kansas highway, the agency says Wentling shot at a vehicle and "Kansas authorities issued a BOLO (Be on the Look Out) for Wendling's vehicle."

He drove into Oklahoma on I-35 and "brandished a firearm to another driver," the OSBI says.

Oklahoma authorities received the BOLO and the report of him pulling the gun.

"Around midnight, Wentling's vehicle was spotted and a pursuit ensued by (the) Perry Police Department and Noble County Sheriff's Office," the OSBI says.

After stopping Wentling's vehicle through a "tactical vehicle intervention," the OSBI says "Wentling brandished a firearm to law enforcement and was shot and pronounced dead at the scene."

"OSBI agents are processing the the crime scene, conducting interviews and following leads," the agency says. "Once completed they will present their comprehensive report to the Noble County District Attorney's Office."

Records from the Kansas Department of Corrections show Wentling previously was convicted of drug-related charges, criminal damage to property, theft and a few other misdemeanors reported in 1998 and 2003.
