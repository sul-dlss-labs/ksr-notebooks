The coroner's office has not determined a cause of death and will determine one after toxicology tests are complete. The district attorney's office is investigating the incident.

According to the press release, Susquehanna Regional police were called to South Clay Street for a reported parking violation just after 7 p.m. Thursday night. Police found Groff with his vehicle in that area, and discovered he had an active bench warrant out of the Lancaster County Sheriffâ€™s Office.

After police attempted to stop him, Groff drove a few blocks and then got out of his car and ran about 200 yards to the river's shore, according to the district attorney's release.

Groff was then arrested and was being helped up when he collapsed, the release states.
