Update: Los Angeles police announced on March 27 that they have found a body they believe to be Shabani’s.

The man who killed himself Thursday after a police chase in Southern California is said to have been the boyfriend of a young woman who has been missing for a month.

Christopher Spotz, 33, of North Hollywood shot himself at the end of a vehicle pursuit that began in Hesperia and ended in Corona, the Riverside County Coroner’s Office said.

According to Los Angeles TV station NBC4, which cited several law enforcement sources, Spotz was the boyfriend of Adea Shabani, a 25-year-old aspiring model and actor who was last seen on Feb. 23 near her Hollywood home.

Los Angeles police are continuing the search for Shabani, and they say the case is still being classified as a missing person rather than a homicide.

Thursday’s chase began when San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies running a license plate check determined that Spotz was driving a stolen pickup truck that had been reported as having “possibly been used in a homicide which had occurred in Los Angeles County,” a California Highway Patrol statement said.

Shabani, who is from Macedonia, had been living in Los Angeles for two years. In recent posts on social media, she mentions studying at the Stella Adler Academy of Acting and Theatre.

Spotz was also an aspiring actor, with several credits on an IMDb page.
