SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

A driver who was killed when his car smashed into a concrete pillar under the Costa Mesa Freeway early Sunday was identified Monday as a 17-year-old senior at Century High School in Santa Ana.

Investigators said Prophet Phaysouphann, who was alone in a 1988 Ford Taurus, led police on a car chase in Santa Ana that reached speeds of 100 mph. He was driving with a restricted license, which is issued to people younger than 18 and prohibits them from driving between midnight and 5 a.m., investigators said.

“We still haven’t determined why he ran,” Santa Ana Police Sgt. Raul Luna said. “But there was no way anybody could have survived that crash.”

The car chase began at 12:40 a.m. Sunday when Phaysouphann sped off after the light turned green at 1st and Grand streets, police said. A Santa Ana police officer parked nearby followed and tried to pull over the driver, but he sped away.

Police said the youth drove past residential areas at speeds of 50 to 55 mph. Eventually, another Santa Ana patrol car and police helicopter joined the pursuit.

Police said the car had reached 100 mph as the driver sped through the intersection of Main Street and Sunflower Avenue. At that point Phaysouphann lost control of the car, police said. He swerved off the road and landed under the overpass of the Costa Mesa Freeway.

A preliminary investigation showed he was not under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

“It was a tragedy that he died this way,” Luna said. “If he had pulled over at the start, he would have probably received just a warning.”

Grief counselors brought in by Century High officials met with students Monday to discuss Phaysouphann’s death. He was described as a good student and was the founding member of a multicultural club on campus.
