NAPLES, Fla. (AP) â€” Authorities say a teenage Florida boy who was seriously injured during a police chase last week has died.

The Naples Daily News reports that the teen died Friday, three days after the crash in Immokalee.

Florida Highway Patrol says the 17-year-old passenger was ejected from a Mercedes-Benz when the 16-year-old girl driving the car veered off the road and overturned while being chased by Collier County deputies.

The boy was taken to a Fort Myers hospital, where he eventually died. The driver was taken to a Naples hospital with minor injuries.

Neither teen was wearing a seat belt.

FHP says the driver faces charges of reckless driving and driving without a license.

Officials didn't immediately say what prompted the chase.
