A heavily armed gunman who opened fire on police after threatening neighbors at a Gardena trailer park died after being shot by officers, authorities said Friday.

Keith Walker, 44, was fatally wounded about 6:45 p.m. Thursday after he opened fire on police officers called to the trailer park in the 17700 block of S. Western Avenue, said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Lt. Larry Lincoln.

Walker was carrying two semiautomatic rifles and a handgun and was advancing on officers from the rear of the park when he was shot, Lincoln said. Walker was in full cardiac arrest when he was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

A search of Walker’s trailer uncovered 13 more handguns, nine rifles and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, deputies said.

The investigation is continuing, sheriff’s officials said Friday. Gardena contracts with sheriff’s homicide detectives to investigate slayings within the city.
