A New Berlin man was found dead inside his home after a shootout and standoff with police, the New Berlin Police Department said Saturday.

The 51-year-old man died from "an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound," according to a statement by the New Berlin Police Department.

According to the statement, police responded to a call about shots being fired in the 4600 block of Oakwood Terrace just before 9 p.m. on Friday. Police and the man exchanged gunfire. Officers retreated and the man, who has not been identified, barricaded himself in the home, where he fired 40 to 50 rounds from a handgun, hitting several neighboring homes and buildings, police said.

Attempts by crisis negotiators to persuade the man to surrender were unsuccessful and police ultimately entered the home. Police said it appeared that the man was not hit by shots fired by police.

The Waukesha Police Department will be the lead agency investigating the incident.
