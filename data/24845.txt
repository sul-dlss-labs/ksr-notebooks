The County of Orange is facing an excessive force lawsuit after sheriff’s deputies fired electroshock taser shots that killed an unarmed 23-year-old San Juan Capistrano man in August 2018.

On behalf of the victim’s relative, Los Angeles-based attorney Dale K. Galipo crafted an 11-count complaint for damages inside the Ronald Reagan Federal Courthouse.

According to Galipo, deputies “unlawfully detained” Andru Maldonado before deploying multiple electroshocks from a taser when the man was acting as if needed psychological help and committing no serious crime.

The attorney also reported that the officers “failed to timely summon medical attention” and that failure “further contributed” to [Maldonado’s] injuries and death.

“The delay of medical care caused decedent extreme physical and emotional pain and suffering,” Galipo, who specializes in police misconduct cases, wrote in the 24-page lawsuit.

A Youtube video posted by an observer showed Maldonado walking through stopped traffic congestion, waving his arms, behaving bizarrely and running in between cars from deputies.

Witnesses also told reporters that he’d been acting strange inside shops, where he complained of a leg injury.

He was shot after failing to comply with deputies’ orders, an Orange County Sheriff’s Department official explained following the unnecessary death.

Lawyers for the county have not yet filed a formal response to the lawsuit.

On the GoFundMe website, friends and well-wishers raised money to help pay funeral costs and celebrate Maldonado’s short life; he dreamed of becoming a medical assistant.

U.S. District Court Judge Josephine L. Staton will preside in the case.

During the last 15 years, police have used tasers to annually kill between 44 and 73 people nationwide.
