A 35-year-old man from Prescott, Arizona, who was fatally wounded by deputies in Industry earlier this month, died from multiple gunshot wounds, a coroner’s office investigator said Sunday.

Jarrid Hurst was shot a little before 2:30 a.m. on June 7 in the area of Railroad Street and Azusa Avenue, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Information Bureau.

An obituary posted on The Prescott News Network’s Daily Courier website said Hurst was born in Phoenix, Ariz. and is survived by his mother and sister, among other relatives.

“He lives on in our hearts,” the family wrote.

Deputies were originally dispatched to the location in response to a call of a person hit by a train. While checking the area to locate any possible victims, they saw a man kneeling by the railroad tracks, authorities said.

As they approached the man, he stood up and allegedly charged at the deputies with a knife in his hand, and a deputy-involved shooting occurred. Hurst was taken to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 3:09 a.m., according to Investigator T. Godoy, with the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner.

The autopsy was completed on June 9, Godoy said. The body has since been released to next of kin.

No deputies were injured in the shooting.

The sheriff’s Homicide Bureau asked anyone with information about the incident to call them at 323-890-5500.
