Galva city offices and the Galva Police Department will soon have new homes.

City offices, currently located in the City Administration Building at 210 Front St., will move to 311 NW 4th Ave. - in the former F.U. White School. The police department will replace city administration in the 210 Front St. building.

According to Mayor Tom Hartman on May 6, the moves may be completed within two to three weeks.

The reason for the moves is the deterioration of the police department, located for many decades at the corner of Northeast 2nd Street and North Center Avenue.

“The major problem we’re having in there is black mold,” said Hartman, of a health risk. “You clean it and try to maintain it, but with the building being in such bad shape, you actually have to take the roof off (to fix it). It’s got major structure problems inside.”

The Bruner, Cooper & Zuck, Inc. engineering firm of Galesburg had inspected the police department in May 2006. They found mold in insulation, water stains in many places, faulty mortar creating openings in exterior walls, and deteriorating brick, among other things. Simply putting a new roof on the building would not solve the problems, engineers said.

Options aren’t good: Repairs are essentially cost-prohibitive, and a new building would cost $600,000 to $700,000, Hartman said.

“So we thought we don’t have any other alternative but to go into the F.U. White building,” he said.

F.U. White is a city-owned structure that’s housed the Kids First day care center for several years and was extensively remodeled two years ago.

Hartman said the May 18 city council meeting will be held at 210 Front St., as usual. Council meetings will begin being held at F.U. White on June 15.
