Lance James Hines, 31, died from self-inflicted injuries while hospitalized, said Blackman-Leoni Department of Public Safety Director Mike Jester. According to his obituary, Hines died on Sunday, Oct. 24.

At about 9:10 a.m. Friday, Oct. 22, police received a 911 call stating a gray 2012 Toyota Prius matching the description of Hines’ vehicle had been spotted at Advance Auto Parts, 135 W. Prospect St. in Jackson.

Once on scene in the store’s parking lot, officers surrounded the vehicle, Jester said, adding that a negotiator tried to get the suspect to exit the vehicle but received no response.

During this time, officers heard what they believed to be a gunshot from inside the vehicle, prompting police to force entry through a passenger side door, Jester said. Police found Hines, who had suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound, inside the vehicle.
