A man suspected of murdering his wife has died nine days after police shot him.



Jeffrey Ferrigan, 50, of northwest suburban Hanover Park died Sunday morning, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. Ferrigan was shot by officers Aug. 26 after police found the body of 40-year-old Jennifer Gustafson during a well-being check in the couple's home.



An autopsy determined Gustafson died from blunt force trauma and ruled the death a homicide.

The U.S. Marshals Service, Cook County Sheriff’s Department and Lockport police tracked down Ferrigan later that day in the 300 block of West 16th Street in south suburban Lockport, according to the Sun-Times.



Police said Ferrigan approached the officers with a knife in a threatening manner. When Ferrigan refused to drop the knife, police shot him.

Ferrigan was taken to Silver Cross Hospital, where he died Sunday.



An autopsy is pending. Illinois State Police are investigating the shooting, while Hanover Park police and the DuPage County Major Crimes continue to investigate Gustafson’s murder.
