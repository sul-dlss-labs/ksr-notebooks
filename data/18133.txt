SAN BERNARDINO >> The man shot and killed by San Bernardino police Monday for allegedly stabbing his wife has been identified as 56-year-old Michael Peacor, officials said Tuesday.

“As the Taser was deployed, he began stabbing the woman,” said Lt. Rich Lawhead, spokesman for the police department. “That’s when the second officer opened fire, striking the suspect.”

Officers were called around 11 a.m. to the home on the corner of 16th Street and Massachusetts Avenue, officials said.

Two officers went inside and could hear screaming and yelling coming from a room, according to a statement.

When they entered the room, officials say they found a man, later identified as Peacor, holding a knife and threatening a woman believed to be his wife, police said.

Officers ordered the man to put down the knife, said Lawhead, but Peacor reportedly refused.

One officer used a Taser on the man, Lawhead said, and as he was being Tased, the man began stabbing the woman, which police say led to the second officer firing on Peacor.

The man and woman were taken to separate hospitals. Peacor was later pronounced dead. The woman is expected to survive.

Anyone with information about the incident can call the San Bernardino Police Department at 909-384-5655 or 909-384-5615.
