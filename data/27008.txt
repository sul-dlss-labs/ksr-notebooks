LAKELAND, FL — The mother of 20-year-old Sidney Alexis Renew criticized the decision of two Polk County sheriff's deputies to open fire on the Lakeland woman during a harrowing confrontation earlier this week that left the 20-year-old dead.



"I truly believe my daughter should have never lost her life," Heather Renew told Patch early Thursday morning. A resident of Ohio, she said she is trying get enough money together to attend the funeral in Florida this week.

"My heart is forever broken," she said, adding she plans to hire a wrongful death attorney. She said she was particularly troubled to learn that one of the bullets apparently struck her daughter in the side of the head. "If they were shooting from in front of the truck, why did she get hit on the side," she asked. "So, knowing this, my daughter was not running toward them trying to run the two cops over."

The Polk County Sheriff's Office painted a different picture of the younger Renew, whom they said had a history of at least four arrests dating back to 2015.

Renew was shot Monday at 12:27 p.m. as deputies were investigating a report of a stolen F-250 pickup truck when they spotted Renew in a wooded area off Lakeland Acres Road in the vehicle, according to the sheriff's office.

"Deputies loudly called out to the suspect numerous times to get out of the stolen truck and talk with them," the Polk County Sheriff's Office reported. "The suspect then accelerated directly towards the two deputies." The sheriff's office said both deputies feared for their safety when they opened fire.
