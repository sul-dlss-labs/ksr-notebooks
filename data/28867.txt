ST. CLOUD — Officers involved in the fatal shooting of a suspect who shot at law enforcement in St. Cloud Tuesday night have been identified by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

Police officers discharged their weapons during the incident Tuesday, the BCA said in a news release Friday.

The release stated 27-year old Kirby Joseph Michael Hengel got out of a car near 2200 block of Division Street and fired a gun at officers, eight of whom shot at Hengel. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Five officers who fired their weapons have been identified as:

• Officer/Investigator Matthew Pribnow, 12 years of service with St. Cloud Police Department.

• Officer Alec Elness, 18 years of service with St. Cloud Police Department.

• Officer Brice Turner , 4 1/2 years of service with St. Cloud Police Department.

• Officer Tavion Buchanan, 3 1/2 years of service with St. Cloud Police Department.

• Officer Lance Christenson, 13 years of service with St. Paul Police Department.

One St. Paul police officer and two ATF agents also fired their weapons, but they have not been identified because of their undercover work, according to the release.

Officers in St. Cloud were assisting St. Paul police and federal authorities in locating Hengel, who was accused of shooting at officers in St. Paul Monday evening and stealing a vehicle.

A woman in Hengel's vehicle was injured, was taken to the hospital for treatment and released. No officers were injured during the incident.

All eight officers are on standard administrative leave, and the BCA's investigation is ongoing. When the investigation is complete, the BCA will present its findings without recommendation to the Stearns County Attorney’s Office for review.
