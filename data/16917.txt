A suspect in a high-speed car chase died early Wednesday morning after the California Highway Patrol said the stolen car he was driving in was speeding at more than 100 mph from Redwood City to San Jose.

The Santa Clara County Coroner identified the driver as 21-year-old Daniel Avalos of San Jose.

CHP Sgt. Jeremy Cox said the white Honda Accord crashed at Winchester Boulevard after the car led police on a chase starting in San Mateo County that began about 3:30 a.m. Fox said that it also appeared the driver was intentionally trying to ram other cars on the road. The driver's 18-year-old female passenger suffered minor injuries and was taken to the hospital. Later, the CHP said the woman was not cooperating.

Officers first initiated the chase because the car was driving at times, as fast as 125 mph, he said. The car, which Fox said was stolen out of Los Ba√±os, ended up crashing after exiting on Winchester, he said, when the driver hit some dirt and turned over. The chase first began on US Highway 101 at Hellyer Avenue and snaked up Interstate Highway 880 to 280.

During the pursuit, a CHP vehicle struck the curb and a wrong-way sign, which shattered the patrol car's windshield.

Two CHP officers in the vehicle suffered minor injuries, Fox said.
