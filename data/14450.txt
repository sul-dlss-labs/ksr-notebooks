VOLUSIA COUNTY, Fla. â€” The State Attorney's Office has cleared all Daytona Beach and South Daytona police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a rape and robbery suspect in May.

Police shot and killed 27-year-old Cheyne Pinkney, who they believe had raped and robbed a woman inside a South Daytona tanning salon.

"Based on our review of the investigation and the information provided, no further action is warranted by this office," said State Attorney R. J. Larizza.

Authorities said Pinkney was at the Hot Tans salon on Beville Road near Nova Road, but he was asked to leave after the owner said Pinkney "creeped her out," asking for a massage.

Police said the woman was able to set off the alarm that brought officers to the business.

When authorities got to the scene, they said Pinkney had locked the door and was inside with the employee.

Officers said Pinkney, who was armed with a toy gun that looked like a real firearm, tried to run out the front door but when he saw police, he went back into the business and headed toward the back exit, where he was confronted by officers from the two police departments.

Surveillance video shows Pinkney removing the gun from his waistband as he was running toward the back exit.

"He proceeded to run out the back door with the gun in his hand and there were several shots fired and the suspect was hit," said Jimmie Flynt of the Daytona Beach Police Department.

Pinkney was taken to Halifax Hospital, where he died of a gunshot wound.

Pinkney's arrest file included 19 arrests with 44 different criminal charges, many of which investigators said he was committing again when he was shot and killed.
