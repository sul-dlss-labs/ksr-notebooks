A domestic violence suspect shot and killed himself when confronted by law enforcement late Wednesday afternoon outside the East Morgan County Hospital in Brush.

Jasper Carter, age 57, was pronounced dead at Colorado Plains Medical Center about 40 minutes after the 5:05 p.m. shooting, Sheriff Jim Crone reported.

Deputies were dispatched to the hospital Wednesday afternoon to meet with a local woman who was being treated for injuries sustained in a violent assault at a residence in the 22000 Blk of Rd 25.

EMCH had gone into lockdown when the woman reported Carter told her he would kill her and himself and was armed with a handgun, Crone said. It was also learned Carter was a retired law enforcement officer from the Denver metro area with SWAT experience.

Other deputies began searching around the residence for Carter and at 5:02 p.m. he was discovered sitting in his pickup on Harvard Street alongside the main parking lot of EMCH, Crone said. Due to the circumstances, plus the victim still being inside the hospital building, Carter was confronted immediately with hope of taking him by surprise and preventing a possible vehicle pursuit and/or armed confrontation, the sheriff added.

However, upon being confronted, Carter refused commands to surrender and stepped out of the pickup with a handgun, Crone said. Despite numerous commands to drop the gun and surrender, Carter shot himself under the chin and was immediately incapacitated.

Carter was transported to CPMC by ambulance where he died a short time later.

This incident is being investigated by the sheriff’s office, Brush Police Department, 13th Judicial District Attorney’s Office and Morgan County Coroner’s Office, with assistance from the Fort Morgan Police Department.

The victim’s name is not being released due to privacy laws.
