MEMPHIS, TN (WMC-TV) - A suspect linked to a man's murder was shot and killed by an off-duty officer this week.

Officer Patrick Meads was off duty when police say Eugene Webb, 24, tried to rob him outside an apartment complex Saturday. Police say Meads shot Webb in self defense.

Webb later died at The Regional Medical Center.

Detectives linked him to two other robberies that occurred on the same night. And detectives say Webb was also involved in the robbery and murder of 46-year-old Glenn Phillips, who was killed last July while unloading groceries at his Cordova apartment.

"In Memphis if you can't even go buy your groceries," said Phillips' mother, Sharlyn. "And when you take them to your car and out of your car, you're going to be approached and shot?"

She says she's thankful the robber choose the wrong victim Saturday when he targeted an off-duty cop."I do think that's justice. They had to be stopped."

Police say two men robbed and killed Phillips, and they have leads on the other suspect.

Sharlyn Phillips says Webb didn't suffer nearly as much as her son did.

"They shot at my son several times, hit him two or three times. What he suffered was much more than what that person suffered, who was shot with one bullet," she said.

Phillips says she has one regret when it comes to her son.

"I thought about going over and hugging him, and telling him I loved him, but I didn't. That's one thing I really regret," she said.
