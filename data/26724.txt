Authorities say a suspected vehicle thief in an SUV that was being pursued by sheriff's deputies struck and killed a motorcyclist Saturday in western Wisconsin.

The St. Croix County Sheriff's Office reported that the pursuit started shortly after 4 p.m. Saturday, after a caller reported a 2013 Jeep Liberty was taken from Star Prairie Township without permission by someone under a no-contact order.

Deputies attempted to stop the SUV north of New Richmond, but the driver refused to pull over. During the chase the driver attempted to pass several vehicles in the village of Deer Park and struck one of a group of motorcyclists making a left turn.

The Jeep driver fled on foot but was caught after a short pursuit. The motorcyclist, identified by the sheriff's office as Dustin Edward Kalland, 39, died at the scene.

New Richmond is about 35 miles northeast of the Twin Cities.
