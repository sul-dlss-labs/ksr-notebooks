"(The officer) already jumped out with his weapon drawn, didn't tell him to stop, didn't tell him put your hands up, drop your weapon, none of that. He just shot him," the man said.

Law enforcement expert Richard Lichten told the station the video didn't tell the whole story.

"I don't know what the distances were, I don't know who the shooter was â€¦ what I do know is there's an individual with a very large weapon in his hand," Lichten said.

Lichten suggested the cop who pulled the trigger may not have had time to tell Curl to drop the weapon.

"Officers don't have to yell 'freeze, get your hands up,' if there's not time to do it," he said. "The officers are supposed to yell a warning if there's time and it prudent and safe to do it.

Curl, a father of four, suffered from bipolar disorder, but took his medication and wasn't a violent person, family members told KTLA.
