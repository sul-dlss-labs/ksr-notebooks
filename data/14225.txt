HAYWARD — A Vallejo man who police say caused a fatal head-on collision last month has been charged with murder, court records show.

Jesus Antonio Godinez, 19, had initially been arrested on suspicion of gross vehicular manslaughter in connection to the March 22 wreck that killed 32-year-old Alejandro Ramirez-Juarez of San Leandro.

Godinez appeared Monday at the Hayward Hall of Justice and was arraigned on one count of murder and one count of DUI, court records show.

The late-night crash took place just before 10:45 p.m. on East 14th Street between Davis and Chumalia streets.

Lt. Robert McManus said that Godinez, who suffered injuries in the crash, was headed north on 14th at a “very high rate of speed” and crossed into oncoming traffic near Davis Street and struck a vehicle driven by Ramirez-Juarez.

Ramirez-Juarez was taken to a hospital but died the following day.

A 56-year-old San Leandro man — a passenger in Ramirez-Juarez’s car — was also injured and taken to a hospital to be treated for non life-threatening injuries, police said.

Godinez was being held without bail Monday at the Santa Rita Jail.
