A Wetumka police officer fatally shot a man Saturday afternoon after he reportedly escaped from custody, got inside a deputy’s vehicle and attempted to run over authorities with the car.

Police took Dylan Rogers, 39, into custody about 3 p.m. after a pursuit that began in Wetumka city limits and ended near County Roads 127 and 381, an Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation news release says.

Officers handcuffed him and put in the back of a police cruiser, but after some time, he apparently slipped a hand out of the cuffs, escaped and got into a Hughes County deputy’s car, the release states.

Once in the car, Rogers reportedly drove toward a Wetumka officer and attempted to run him over. The officer fired at least one time, striking Rogers. He was pronounced dead at the scene, the release says.

The OSBI is investigating the shooting, and the Hughes County District Attorney’s Office will determine whether the shooting was justified.
