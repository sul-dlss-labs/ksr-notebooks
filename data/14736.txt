HENDERSONVILLE – The state Highway Patrol has released the name of a man killed Wednesday night after fleeing a traffic stop in Hendersonville.

Allen Dewayne Goodman, 48, Maitland, Fla., died in the wreck shortly before 11 p.m., according to Sgt. Chris Goodson with the state Highway Patrol.

“He was originally stopped, and as we were dealing with the traffic stop, he took off,” Goodson said.

Goodman immediately got off the interstate and onto U.S. 64. He then took a right onto Sugarloaf Road. He crashed about two and a half miles down that road, according to the Highway Patrol.

The car “ran off the right side of the road and over-corrected and came back onto the roadway and crossed left of center,” according to Goodson.

The Lexus hit a 2013 Ford pickup truck. The car was traveling at a high rate of speed, Goodson said.

“The car was sliding sideways and the front of the truck hit the passenger side of the vehicle,” the trooper said.

Two people inside the truck were hurt. Goodson identified the injured as Benjamin Cerezo Gonzales, 52, of Hendersonville, and his wife Emma Cerezo, 53.

Benjamin Gonzales was treated and released. Emma Cerezo was airlifted to Greenville Memorial Hospital. An updated condition was not available on Friday.

Goodson said authorities aren’t sure why Goodman took off. “We may never know why he did it,” he said.
