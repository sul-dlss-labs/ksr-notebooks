Volusia County deputies shot and killed an armed robbery suspect who was later found to be armed with a large knife Sunday, officials said.

The incident started about 12:30 p.m. when several victims reported their wallets were stolen at gunpoint at a parking lot on Saxon Boulevard in Orange City, said Volusia County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Andrew Gant.

The victims gave authorities a description of the suspect and the vehicle they got away in, officials said.

About 1 p.m., deputies stopped a vehicle matching that description about seven miles away near U.S. 17-92 and Firehouse Road, Gant said.

Deputies said Erin Casey Finney, 24, was driving the vehicle and complied with commands.

Officials said Donald Edward Brown III, 33, who was in the passenger seat, did not comply.

Deputies said Brown got out of the vehicle as he was told but would not show his hands.

That’s when three deputies opened fire and killed Brown, Gant said.

Gant said as deputies searched Brown, they found a “large” knife in his hand.

“His behavior presented a threat to deputies, which made them use deadly force …,” Gant said. “They knew he had something, especially since he was a suspect in an armed robbery.”

Victims in the armed robbery reported the suspects had a gun. It’s unclear if a firearm was found.

Brown has been arrested 16 times in Volusia County since 2010 on charges including grand theft, dealing in stolen property and providing false owner information to a pawnshop.

Finney also has a rap sheet in Volusia. She’s been arrested 10 times since 2012 on charges including robbery with a deadly weapon, grand theft, burglary, and drug possession.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.

The three deputies have been put on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
