A driver accused in a fatal car chase and crash Saturday had outstanding warrants of criminal sexual conduct with a minor girl and now faces multiple charges.

Jose Louis Romero Gomez, 26, of Inman remained in the Spartanburg County jail Tuesday. His bail was set at $84,257.

He had been hospitalized for injuries received in the crash and was arrested Monday night.

Gomez is charged with felony driving under the influence resulting in death, possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, not having a valid driver's license and failing to stop for police.

He was wanted at the time of the chase on two warrants that accused him of having sex with a 15-year-old girl twice in 2001.

A deputy said that at 7:30 a.m. Saturday he saw a silver Mazda pickup truck crossing the double yellow line several times on Gibbs Road. Lynn Hayes said the vehicle slowed with the activation of the cruiser's blue lights but did not stop.

The driver, later identified as Gomez, is accused of running a stop sign and red light.

He hit a Honda Civic in the driver's side door at the intersection of Highway 357 and Holly Springs Road. Killed was Martin Perez Trejo, 32, of 691 Hammett Road, who was driving to work at 31-W Insulation, authorities said.

Sheriff Chuck Wright said that the deputy's vehicle was not involved in the crash. Wright said Gomez had a blood alcohol content of .27. In South Carolina, the blood alcohol limit that infers intoxication is .08.
