MIDWEST CITY, Oklahoma -- A man was killed in a car crash after driving over 100 mph on N.E. 23rd Street in Midwest City and striking another car.

An officer saw Dennis Joe Jackson driving in the center lane and into oncoming traffic in a 1983 El Camino along N.E. 23rd Street near Spencer Road. The officer said the 44-year-old was driving over 100 mph and ran a red light.

The police officer made a U-turn to stop Jackson, but he had already sped about a half mile away and ran a second red light near the intersection of N.E. 23rd Street and Midwest Boulevard.

Jackson hit a maroon Ford Taurus headed eastbound, skidded across five lanes of traffic and went airborne. The 44 year old was ejected and the car came to rest on its side after shearing off a concrete manhole cover. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Ford Taurus had the passenger side of the vehicle ripped off during the crash. The driver was treated and released at the scene.
