Muncie policemen cleared in fatal shooting during standoff

INDIANAPOLIS -- Two Muncie police officers have been cleared of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a man during a standoff.

WTHR-TV (http://bit.ly/1NcbM58 ) reports that an investigation by the Delaware County prosecutor's office concluded both officers acted in self-defense when they fatally shot 35-year-old Shawn Michael Ruble in August.

Prosecutors say Ruble jumped from a burning garage and pointed a pellet gun at police, claiming it was a .40-caliber handgun. Ruble is believed to have started the garage fire.

Police said that Ruble told officers he didn't want to go back to jail and ignored repeated demands to drop the weapon.

Prosecutors say Ruble then pointed the weapon at officers who opened fire, fatally striking the man.
