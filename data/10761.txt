BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- The Birmingham chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference today called for the Alabama Bureau of Investigation to look into the death of a burglary suspect who was killed over the weekend while fleeing from a Hueytown police officer.

The officer, whom Hueytown police have declined to identify, spotted Ronald Anderson, 34, in the process of a burglary in Hueytown on Saturday and chased his vehicle down 19th Street in Bessemer and along Interstate 20/59 until Anderson's car struck a fire hydrant at 17th Street and Barbour Avenue in Birmingham, according to Birmingham police.

The officer, in his patrol car, continued chasing Anderson, who was now on foot, and accidentally struck and killed Anderson after he fell in the 2700 block of Pike Road Alley, Hueytown police Chief Chuck Hagler said. The officer did not see Anderson in the alley, Hagler said.

The officer has been placed on administrative leave while the incident is being investigated by Birmingham police, Hagler said.

SCLC chapter President Calvin Woods said his organization wants the ABI to investigate to determine if the officer acted improperly, whether other agencies were contacted during the chase at any point and whether Anderson's death could have been prevented.

Hagler said the ABI already had planned to review Birmingham's investigation and said Hueytown dispatchers did notify other agencies during the course of the chase.
