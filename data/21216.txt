A 29-year-old Munith man died Wednesday night after he drove a pickup truck off the road into a tree as a Michigan State Police trooper pursued him in Waterloo Township.

Chad Ousley was heading north on Mount Hope Road north of I-94 in Grass Lake Township about 10:13 p.m. when the trooper saw him driving erratically and stopped his vehicle, said state police Lt. Jim Shaw.

As the trooper, whose name was not released, approached the pickup, the man started spinning his tires and took off at a high rate of speed, Shaw said.

The trooper chased him for about five minutes north on Mount Hope Road to Hannewald Road, where Mount Hope comes to an end at a T intersection. Shaw said Ousley continued through the intersection, hitting a stop sign and driving into a field, where he struck a tree.

Shaw said police will not know whether alcohol was a factor until an autopsy is conducted.

Ousley was weaving in the road and at one time was driving north in the southbound lane, Shaw said. At some point during the chase, Ousley turned off the pickup's headlights.
