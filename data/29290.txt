OXFORD, Miss. — Officers in Oxford, Mississippi shot and killed a man during a barricade situation late Wednesday evening, police said. The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating.

Oxford Police identified the man shot as Kenneth Dale Miller, 47, of Oxford.

Police Chief Jeff McCutchen said police were called around 7 p.m. to a domestic disturbance at The Mark Apartments.

When officers arrived, McCutcheon said Miller answered the door holding a shotgun. A female victim ran out the door to safety and Miller shut the door.

At that point, Miller barricaded himself inside as police tried to negotiate. At 9:50, he came outside, yelled and pointed a gun at officers, McCutchen said. That’s when the officers fired.

“These events are difficult for everyone in the community. Our prayers go out to all families involved,” McCutchen said in a statement.

Law enforcement blocked off the complex and wouldn’t let anyone come in or out. Residents said they were asked to stay inside their apartments overnight as officers tried to negotiate with the subject.

“I came late to the scene, but my mom heard them say, ‘Come out with your hands up’ over a megaphone,” said Mary Mac Parnell. “They said that multiple times, and then when I got here, I heard rapid gunfire and we all ran to a back room just in case anything would come through.”

The officers involved were not hurt. The chief did not release information on how many officers were involved or their enforcement status.

Officers cleared the scene by 6 a.m. Thursday.
