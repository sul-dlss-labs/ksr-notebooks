Osbourne Broadie, 39, used this pair of scissors used to stab his girlfriend, Tameka Washington, 38, in the chest and attack two police officers in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens Sunday.

The scissors-wielding ex-con fatally shot by cops at a Brooklyn apartment had been drinking — and had a physical confrontation with cops several years ago, police sources said Monday.

Osbourne Broadie, 39, also had an extensive rap sheet: 13 arrests — eight in New York, four in Houston and one in South Carolina, cops said.

Broadie had been drinking in the hours before he clutched scissors and attacked police at an apartment in Prospect-Lefferts Gardens about 8:30 p.m. Sunday.

Cops who arrived at the Clarkson Ave. building found Broadie's girlfriend, Tameka Washington, 38, in the building's lobby; she had been stabbed once in the chest. They quickly found Broadie and demanded he drop the scissors, but he lunged at them, cops said. Officers fired multiple times, cops said.

Washington was in critical but stable condition on Monday.

In September 2005, Broadie fought with cops who tried to arrest him after he grabbed a 13-year-old girl by the neck and threw her against a wall in East Harlem, according to a criminal complaint.

He yelled, "I'll kill someone before I get arrested again," the document shows.

He served time in state prison from 2005 to 2007 on the attempted assault charge, records show.

The incident came on the heels of another police involved shooting in East Harlem earlier Sunday. Police shot and seriously wounded a 23-year-old man at the George Washington Houses after he pointed a revolver at them, cops said.

Cops shot and killed a drugstore robber Friday after a pursuit on the Upper East Side.
