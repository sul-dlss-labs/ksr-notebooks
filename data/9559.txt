Members of the Winslow Police Department SWAT team shot and killed a man during a standoff early Thursday morning in Winslow.

According to information released from Winslow Police Chief Stephen Garnett, officers responded to a report of shots fired on the 100 block of East Aspinwall at about 6:30 p.m Wednesday. A suspect, later identified as Anthony Wheeler, 61, barricaded himself in the residence and did not respond to police demands.

The Winslow police SWAT team responded to the scene and attempted to breach the front door of the home at about 12:40 a.m. Thursday. They were met by gunfire, regrouped and re-established a perimeter.

Given the danger of the situation, officers at the scene requested assistance from a second SWAT team consisting of Show Low police and Navajo County sheriff's deputies. After the second team arrived, the Winslow SWAT team tried to breach the front door a second time.

"Wheeler retaliated by firing upon the officers," Garnett stated in the press release. "Officers from the Winslow Special Response Team returned fire and struck Wheeler multiple times. He was pronounced dead at the scene by medical staff."

Bart Graves, spokesperson for DPS, said that DPS investigators are conducting the investigation into the shooting. He would not comment further until the investigation is complete.

Neither DPS nor the Winslow Police Department would comment on whether the officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
