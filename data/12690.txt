MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) – Memphis police have shot and killed a man who authorities said struck two officers with a car.

According to The Commercial Appeal, the mother of the man who was shot said he was 28-year-old Amjustine Hunter. Giovanna Hunter said she asked police to let her see her son, but they wouldn’t let her.

Memphis Police Department Col. Mike Ryall said the driver suddenly accelerated as the officers were checking the car for suspicious activity. One of the officers was taken to a hospital with injuries. The other officer was also struck, but remained on the scene Tuesday night.

The newspaper reported Tuesday’s shooting was the fifth officer-involved fatal shooting this year in Memphis.

On Dec. 14, city police Officer Martoiya Lang was killed while serving a drug warrant.
