PORT HURON, Mich. – A 49-year-old woman was killed and four others were injured in a crash following a police pursuit Wednesday morning in Port Huron.

The crash happened at about 8:30 a.m. at the corner of Dove and 24th streets.

Officers said a white Chevrolet Camaro was driving erratically and took off as a police cruiser turned around. When the officer activated his overhead lights and siren, the Camaro turned south of 24th Street and continued to flee, police said.

When the officer pulled onto 24th Street, he told dispatch the Camaro was traveling over 100 mph onto eastbound Dove Street.

The pursuit ended when the Camaro ran a red light at Dove and slammed into an SUV, police said. A third car was also struck close to the intersection.

The pursuing police car was a distance away due to the Camaro's speed, and officers called for rescue crews, police said.

The 35-year-old Port Huron resident driving the Camaro and three male passengers were taken to the hospital with life-threatening injuries.

The 49-year-old woman driving the SUV was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the third vehicle was checked out at a nearby hospital for non-serious injuries, police said.

“Obviously you can tell from the damage that it was a severely high rate of speed,” Lt. Roger Wesch said.

Police shut down the scene for several hours to investigate.
