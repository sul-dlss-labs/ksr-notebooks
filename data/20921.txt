Police have not released further information about a 17-year-old Chelsea High School student killed in a crash after reportedly fleeing police on Saturday.

Chelsea Police Chief Ed Toth said no further information would be released Monday beyond a press release given to The Ann Arbor News on Sunday.

Toth said the department would not release the name of the teen.

However, an obituary provided to The Ann Arbor News by Staffan-Mitchell Funeral Home showed 17-year-old Eric J. Robbins of Chelsea died on Oct. 31.

He was a Chelsea High School senior, according the the full obituary from the funeral home.

The Rev. William Turner of St. Mary's Catholic Church confirmed Eric Robbins died in a crash on Taylor Street in Chelsea.

He noted the teen had been a server at the church, and said he was gentle and loved his friends.

"It's a terrible shock," he said.

He declined to speak further, citing the privacy of the family, but confirmed that a funeral service for Robbins would be held on Wednesday.

A funeral service will be held at 11 a.m. Nov. 4 at the church, the obituary said.

In a Sunday press release, the department said police responded shortly after 2 a.m. Oct. 31 to a report of malicious destruction of property.

Police said officers spotted the vehicle and conducted a traffic stop. The driver reportedly fled the scene at a high rate of speed.

The vehicle was found crashed into a tree about five blocks away on Taylor Street near Moore Drive, police said. The driver was pronounced dead at the scene.

Police said the Chelsea Police Department was in contact with Chelsea Public Schools regarding possible grief counseling on Sunday.

Chelsea High School principal Michael Kapolka did not immediately return a request for comment.
