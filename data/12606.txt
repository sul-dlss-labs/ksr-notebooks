SPRINGFIELD -- Westfield police were justified in their use of force in the fatal shooting of a suspect who stabbed an officer even after being hit multiple times by a stun gun, Hampden District Attorney Mark G. Mastroianni said in a statement released Monday.

Douglas Musto, 27, of Southampton, was killed in the April 7 confrontation after police were summoned to 128 Elm Street for a report of a domestic disturbance.

Musto used a knife with a 3 1/8 -inch blade to stab patrolman Francis Gaulin during a struggle, Mastroianni wrote. Another patrolman, James Renaudette, fired 5 shots -- 4 of which struck Musto -- after the suspect ignored orders to drop the knife.

"At the time each officer acted, each feared for the safety of his life and / or the life of another responding officer and the residents of 128 Elm St.," Mastroianni wrote.
