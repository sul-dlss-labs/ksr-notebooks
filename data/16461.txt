CINNAMINSON TWP. -- Why was Joshua Malave in a rural Pennsylvania town nearly 100 miles away from South Jersey? Why was he burglarizing a gun store there? Was he alone or did he travel with others? Why did the 18-year-old township resident open fire on police officers at the scene?

Investigating authorities said Wednesday that many questions remain surrounding the death of Malave, 18, who was killed during an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement following a burglary attempt on Monday.

Below is what we know so far about Malave and the incident in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania.

- Malave attempted to burglarize the Horseshoe Pike Gun Shop, in Campbelltown, Pennsylvania, early Monday. A burglary alarm went off and law enforcement responded to the scene, which is about 15 minutes away from Harrisburg. Malave, carrying a rifle, fled into a nearby soy bean field with bags and backpacks filled with guns. He was fatally shot by police during the encounter.

- Pennsylvania news stations reported a statement from the owners of the burglarized store that read in part: "We would also like to thank the many people that have reached out to offer their concern and support to our family. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family."

- Lebanon County District Attorney David Arnold told NJ Advance Media on Wednesday that interviews with responding officers are still being conducted and it wasn't immediately clear who fired first.

- Malave graduated from Cinnaminson High School in June. School district Superintendent Salvatore Illuzzi expressed condolences to the family, according to a Philadelphia Inquirer report. The report adds that Malave worked at a Shop Rite grocery store along Route 130, according to the Burlington County Times.

- Malave was arrested in Delran last month after police responded to a local resident's reports of gunfire near Lake Lonnie, which is surrounded by a wooded area. He was released from the Burlington County Jail on July 16 and posted an update to his Twitter account noting the same.

- His Twitter account shows a picture of him aiming a small-caliber rifle and another of him wearing camouflage gear while standing in the woods. The last update posted to the account was on July 31. Prior posts -- including ones as recent as July 25 -- indicated he was going on vacation.

An update two weeks later read, "Next week gonna be one for the books." A Twitter user who was friends with Malave posted late Wednesday, "Never can forget you. I know you're in a better place. I know you're happy now."

What appears to be his Facebook page shows little public information besides a picture uploaded in September 2014 of him loading a shell into a shotgun. Other users identifying themselves as family members expressed their sorrow on Facebook.

"Life is precious we are not giving tomorrow, enjoy your kids and loved ones today. My heart is hurting in many ways," one family member wrote.
