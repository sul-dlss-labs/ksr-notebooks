LOS ANGELES >> The son of a man killed in a deputy-involved shooting in Santa Clarita in January is suing the county, alleging civil rights violations, battery, negligence and violations of laws protecting people with disabilities.

Christopher Pettersen, the son of 47-year-old Steven Burke Pettersen of Canyon Country, filed the lawsuit Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court, seeking unspecified damages.

Pettersen was a military veteran who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the lawsuit. His son maintains that the deputies should have recognized Pettersen’s symptoms of the disorder and been better trained to deal with him by calling for assistance.

The sheriff’s department reported after the shooting that Pettersen had been holding an object resembling a spear. But according to the lawsuit, he had a hockey stick and was wearing only socks, boxer shorts and a T-shirt, and also had a cast on his right arm.

Sheriff’s spokeswoman Nicole Nishida said the department has not yet received the complaint and does not comment on litigation.

Pettersen was fired upon in two separate instances about 8:25 p.m. Jan. 30 at the intersection of Soledad Canyon Road and Sierra Highway, according to authorities, who said at the time that he had struck a passing vehicle with a metal spear when he was confronted by two deputies.

According to the sheriff’s department, the suspect appeared unscathed by the shooting and continued to behave erratically. As the deputies moved back toward their vehicle, Pettersen approached them with a knife in his hand, prompting the deputies to fire again, striking him multiple times, according to the department’s account of what happened.

Neither of the deputies was injured. Pettersen was pronounced dead at the scene.

Bystanders had flagged down the deputies and reported that a man was running in and out of traffic, holding a spear and waving it at passersby, authorities said.
