A police-involved shooting remains under investigation Tuesday after a man was killed and an officer was injured in Southeast D.C. Monday night. The shooting happened about 10:45 p.m. in the 4200 block of 6th Street SE, while officers were looking for a suspect in an earlier shooting that happened nearby.

Investigators are trying to determine the chain of events that led to the confrontation between officers and the man.

Police said the man matched a description of the suspect in the earlier shooting, but it remains unclear what prompted the man, who had a gun, to open fire on the officers.

Officials confirmed Tuesday morning that the man, 41-year-old Dominique Campbell of Southeast, died at the scene. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The injured officer, who was not identified, was taken to a local hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries, police said.
