A Ford Explorer SportTrac lies on its side following a three-vehicle crash near the intersection of Getwell and Goodman roads Thursday. The driver of a Honda Accord (also shown) was fleeing from police following an armed robbery in Memphis and was killed in the crash. The SUV's driver as well as the driver of a purple Neon involved in the crash both were transported to area hospitals for minor injuries.
