A man acting erratically north of downtown Los Angeles collapsed and died, according to authorities.

Officers were sent to the area of Cesar Chavez Avenue and Broadway about 4 a.m. on a report that "a man was running around cars," said Los Angeles police officer Norman Eisenman of the Media Relations office.

After officers arrived on scene, the man collapsed and lost consciousness, and paramedics took him to a hospital, where he died. His name was not immediately released.

The case is being investigated as an "in-custody death," Eisenman said.
