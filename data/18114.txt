Crime & Safety Compton Man Killed in FBI-Involved Shooting; Family Wants Answers According to media reports, the man was killed during an altercation as FBI SWAT agents served a search warrant at his mother's home. Reply

COMPTON, CA â€” A Compton family is looking for answers today after a family member was killed by an FBI agent on Thursday night.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department confirmed Saturday that a shooting involving an FBI agent occurred in Compton sometime between 9 p.m. and midnight Thursday. Although the shooting happened in the sheriff's jurisdiction, deputies had little to no details of the incident because it is an FBI case. The FBI's Los Angeles office would not comment on the shooting when reached Saturday.

According to NBC4, a man identified by family members as 32-year-old David Coborubio was fatally wounded during an altercation as FBI SWAT agents served a search warrant at his mother's home on South White Avenue. The warrant, however, named another man, identified as 39-year-old Paul White, who was wanted for allegedly fleeing parole and possessing a firearm, NBC4 reported. The FBI told the station that White was arrested at the residence and is in custody.

The family told NBC4 that they haven't seen or located Coborubio's body. "I want to know why they killed my son," Mona Martinez -- the victim's mother -- told the station. "I want to know what the hell they were doing there." NBC4 reported that the shooting will be investigated by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office, and by investigators from the FBI's Washington headquarters.
