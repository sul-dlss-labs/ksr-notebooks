A suspect who was killed by a Prince George's County police officer after he killed a man inside an Oxon Hill liquor store Wednesday afternoon has been identified by officials.

The Prince George's County Police Department said 27-year-old David Hall of Temple Hills shot and killed 25-year-old Ralland Whitfield of Lothian inside Seitz Liquors in the 6200 block of Livingston Road at about 1:15 p.m.

Investigators said Whitfield had just made a purchase at the store when Hall entered and shot him multiple times. The motive for the murder remains unclear at this time, according to officials.

As Hall fled the store, he was confronted by Cpl. Andrew McKenney, an officer with the robbery suppression team, who was in the area on an unrelated matter and ran toward the sound of gunfire.

Authorities said McKenney ordered Hall, who was still armed, to stop, but Hall continued to run toward him. McKenney, a 10-year-veteran of the force, shot and killed Hall, according to police.

McKenney has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Anyone with information that can aid detectives in their investigation is urged to call (301) 772-4925.
