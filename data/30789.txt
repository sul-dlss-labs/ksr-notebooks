An incident in Port Carbon that began Tuesday afternoon and went into the evening hours ended with a call to the coroner's office.

The police incident started around 4:30pm, Tuesday when police received a report of an active shooter and a man threatening to harm himself on Third Street in the borough.

Numerous State and Local Police responded to the scene.

After numerous attempts to have the male exit the home on his own, a State Police SERT team was just outside the home when one shot was heard inside.

Just after 8:00pm, the Schuylkill County Coroner's Office was called to the scene and it was later reported that 50 year old male was found dead inside the home.

A short time later, law enforcement began clearing the scene.
