SAN ANTONIO â€“ A man who was fatally wounded by police following a chase has been identified.

San Antonio police identified the man Friday as 60-year-old Douglas Faith (pictured above).

Police chief Anthony Trevino said Faith led officers on a chase and crashed his car near Karen Lane and Corinne Drive on Wednesday evening.

When officers started to approach Faith, he fired shots at police cruisers, Trevino said. Moments later, officers returned gunfire, killing the suspect.

Prior to the fatal shooting, police tried to pull Faith over for a traffic stop, but he instead drove to a Walmart on Loop 410 near Rigsby Avenue. After a brief, tense confrontation with an officer in the parking lot, the suspect took off again, Trevino said.
