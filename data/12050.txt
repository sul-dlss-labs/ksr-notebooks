ABC Cleveland reported that more than 30 officers were involved in the 25-minute chase, which ended behind a middle school in East Cleveland. There, 13 officers fired 137 rounds into the suspects' car, Cleveland Police Chief Michael McGrath said in a statement.

Suspects Timothy Russell, 42, and Malissa Williams, 30, suffered multiple gunshot wounds and were killed. According to the Cuyahoga County coroner's office, Williams was shot 24 times, and Russell was shot 23 times.

Police reported that no gun was found in the suspects' car. East Cleveland Police detective Scott Gardner told WEWS that preliminary investigation revealed no evidence that the suspects had exchanged fire with police.

In a press conference, McGrath called the incident “a tragedy, not just for the community, but for the police department.”

Cleveland Police have called on the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation to help find out why the chase lasted so long, and why so many rounds were fired.

On Monday, police released recordings of district-by-district radio traffic from the night of the incident.

According to WOIO, police radio chatter repeatedly referred to a gun, as well as shots being fired from Russell and Williams' car during the chase.
