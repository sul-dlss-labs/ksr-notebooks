A man who smashed into a utility pole and a tree in Montgomery County Saturday night while fleeing police died Monday afternoon.

Police said they spotted a car parked in a fire lane in Aspen Hill at Connecticut Avenue and Aspen Hill Road. An officer asked the man to move his vehicle.

Police discovered the manâ€™s license was suspended and a tow truck to remove the car. When the tow truck arrived, the man jumped back into his car and fled.

Officers followed, but did not chase the suspect. They came upon smoke and dust just west of Marianna Drive at Aspen Hill Road.

Police said the driver apparently lost control of his vehicle and hit a utility pole and a tree. He was ejected from the vehicle.

The man was transported to Suburban Hospital in grave condition. He has been identified as Annal Upadhyaya, 21, from Gaithersburg.
