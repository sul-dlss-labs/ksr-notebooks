SOUTH SIDE â€” An off-duty Chicago police officer shot and killed a man who tried to rob him at gunpoint outside the officer's South Side apartment building Saturday night, police said.

The officer, who had just returned from the grocery store around 8 p.m., was in the 6900 block of South Crandon Avenue when he was approached by two armed men, said police spokesman Pat Camden. The six-year veteran drew his gun and fired several shots, striking one as he ran from the scene, Camden said. The unidentified man collapsed nearby and later died.

Although police did not know if the other man was hit, they were canvassing hospitals for gunshot victims, Camden said. Police recovered a weapon.
