The Cook County medical examiner's office has not yet determined the cause of death of a man who died Friday after being handcuffed by Chicago police after a chase.

Reginald Heron, 48, of the 12000 block of South Parnell Avenue was approached by two officers just after 7 a.m. Friday because he matched the description of a man who had broken into the Academy of Our Lady Convent at 9535 S. Loomis St., police said. He was spotted in the 9900 block of South Vincennes Avenue and acted erratically while being chased on foot by police for 10 minutes, police said.

Four officers eventually apprehended him and restrained him with four pairs of handcuffs, police said. He was standing next to a squad car when he slumped to his knees, police said.

Heron was pronounced dead shortly before 8 a.m. at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, the medical examiner's office said.
