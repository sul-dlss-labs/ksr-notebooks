A suspected bank robber shot and killed by Tucson police in the back yard of a midtown home Saturday was holding an automotive tool, similar to a filter wrench, police said.

The man was identified as Armando Alvarez, 44, said Sgt. Chris Widmer, a Tucson Police Department spokesman.

Alvarez was suspected of entering Chase Bank, 6257 E. Broadway, with a weapon shortly after it opened at 9 a.m. He approached a teller, displayed the weapon and demanded money. He fled the bank on a bicycle.

Moments after the robbery, a witness pointed out Alvarez as the suspect to an officer who was arriving at the scene, Widmer said. The officer attempted to make contact, but lost sight of him as he fled into a neighborhood west of the bank.

While officers attempted to locate Alvarez, a 911 caller in the 5600 block of East Ninth Street said someone had left a bicycle in his front yard, and one of the sheds in his back yard appeared tampered with, Widmer said.

Sgt. Jeremy Williams and Officers Jason Ives and Jason Hollander went to the house and the homeowner told them what he saw. The residents were evacuated from their home and the officers checked the yard before making their way to the shed.

The officers attempted to call out Alvarez by voicing numerous commands, and knocking on the shed. Alvarez came out of the shed and turned to face the officers, Widmer said. The officers noted that Alvarez had a black object in his right hand and he was attempting to conceal his hand behind his leg, Widmer said.

Officers ordered Alvarez to drop the object and show both of his hands, but Alvarez did not. He "made a quick, furtive movement and raised the object up, pointing it in the direction of the officers," said Widmer.

All three officers fired their guns, and rendered aid to Alvarez until paramedics arrived. He was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, Widmer said.
