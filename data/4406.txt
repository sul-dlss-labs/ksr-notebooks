Assault Suspect Dies After Attacking Police Officers July 26, 2005

Los Angeles: On July 25, 2005, at 3:45 a.m., Newton officers responded to a radio call of an “Assault With a Deadly Weapon Suspect” at 8th Street and Ceres Street. A citizen had reported a man fighting with people who had just committed an “Attempted Theft.” When officers arrived they encountered a male, Hispanic, who was later identified as Eliseo Maldanado, a 33-year-old Los Angeles resident. Officers attempted to verbally calm Maldanado whose behavior was extremely confrontational and irrational. Because of Maldanado’s agitated state, officers requested a backup.

After multiple attempts by officers to talk with the suspect, Maldanado began to physically attack them. Having exhausted all less-than-lethal options, including the use of Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) Spray, Taser, and collapsible baton, officers were able to take Maldanado into custody by using a Team Take Down. Maldanado was finally controlled and handcuffed. The entire altercation lasted ten minutes.

Maldanado and three officers were injured during the altercation. A rescue ambulance was summoned and Maldanado was transported to USCMC, where he failed to respond to medical treatment and died as a result of a possible heart attack. The officers were treated for their injuries and released.

Force Investigation Division is handling the investigation.
