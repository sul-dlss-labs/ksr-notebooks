CHICAGO â€” A Chicago police officer who fatally shot a suspected drug dealer in a struggle for the officer's gun followed department policy, the Chicago Police Department said Monday.

Michael Walker, 21, was shot in the face Sunday by the narcotics officer as the two wrestled in the hallway of a Cabrini-Green public housing building in the 500 block of West Division Street, where Walker lived.

An investigation of the shooting found the officer's actions "were within department standards," said police spokesman Carlos Herrera.

At about 7 a.m. Sunday, the plainclothes officer was looking for Walker after allegedly observing him conduct a drug sale outside the building, police said.

Once inside, police said the officer found Walker selling drugs to another person. The officer grabbed Walker by the collar and tried to arrest him, police said.

Walker ran and the officer followed. When they reached the 6th floor, "the offender reached for the officer's gun, disarming him," Herrera said.

As they wrestled, the officer, who still had his hand on the weapon, accidentally pulled the trigger, Herrera said.

The officer suffered minor back and knee injuries and was treated at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said police spokesman Pat Camden said.
