Glenn Patrick Rose, 25, a white man, was shot and killed by deputies and officers while driving a pickup truck in the 300 block of 1st Avenue in Covina about 2:07 a.m. Tuesday, May 13.

Authorities said California Highway Patrol officers were on the Pomona Freeway pursuing a 1991 white Honda Accord believed to have been stolen by Rose and his girlfriend. Deputies from the Walnut sheriff's station were asked to assist when the chase moved from the freeway to Covina streets.

L.A. County Sheriff's Department officials said the couple drove into an alley in the 300 block of 1st Avenue, where they abandoned the Accord and took a 1989 burgundy pickup truck that was parked in the alley. According to authorities, a CHP car slammed into the back of the truck as it was pulling out. The truck then collided with a sheriff's patrol car. Still attempting to flee, the driver backed the truck into the same CHP car, then drove toward deputies who were taking cover behind a nearby vehicle. Fearing for their lives, deputies and CHP officers fired several shots. Rose was pronounced dead at the scene, according to Lt. David Coleman of the Sheriff's Homicide Bureau.

Rose's girlfriend, Sarah Morales, 24, a white woman, was arrested shortly after the shooting. She was charged with assaulting an officer and unlawfully driving or taking a vehicle.
