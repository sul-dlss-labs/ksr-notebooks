The Repository

It’s time to plan ahead for this year's Kick for the Cure, which will be held at Green Memorial Stadium on Saturday, Sept. 24, where the Green High School Girls Varsity and JV soccer teams will take on the North Canton Hoover teams on the field.

Off the field, though, these teams, their schools and their communities will all join together as one to raise funds and awareness of cancer.

The inaugural event, in 2007, was held in honor of Shawn Basone, wife of Green soccer coach, Jeff Basone. Sadly, Shawn passed away after her long battle with cancer in 2008, but the event continues each year, honoring Shawn and all others that have been touched by cancer.

The logos for each year proudly include her initials as a reminder of her fight and as a way to encourage all involved to continue her efforts.

Each year two charities – a local charity, along with a nationally recognized organization – are chosen to receive the money raised from this special fundraiser.

To date, the event has raised a total of $25,000.

Last year, donations were made to Stewart's Caring Place, Susan G. Komen Foundation and The American Cancer Society.

This year, Green and Hoover have chosen Akron Children's Hospital (Showers Family Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders) and Susan G. Komen Foundation to be the recipients of funds raised.

With planning already under way, this year's event promises to be bigger and better than ever. Mark your calendars for Kick for the Cure on Sept. 24!
