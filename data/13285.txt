On Tuesday, 08/20/13, at 9:43 pm, a Sherman Police Officer conducted a traffic stop in the 400 block of South Hazelwood Street in Sherman, Texas. The driver was identified as Lesa Ann Surratt, w/f, DOB: 06/01/1962.

Surratt was subsequently placed under arrest for the traffic violation, handcuffed behind her back and placed into the back left passenger seat of the Sherman Police vehicle. Said police unit was equipped with an in-car video which had the capability to record the interior portion of the unit.

The video recording showed Surratt removing her left hand from the handcuff, reaching underneath her dress, retrieving an object and placing said object into her mouth. Quickly thereafter, a Sherman Police Officer discovered Surratt had removed the handcuff and observed she had something in her mouth. Two Sherman Police Officers used pressure point techniques on the side of Surratts neck in an attempt to make her open her mouth and to keep her from swallowing the item, which was believed to be illegal narcotics.

Surratt refused all commands by the officers and was removed from the back of the patrol vehicle. It was at this time the officers observed Surratt turning blue around her face and realized she was not breathing. A Sherman Police Officer immediately called for an ambulance to his location. While waiting for the ambulance to arrive, numerous Sherman Police Officers provided first aid, in the form of chest compressions and the Heimlich maneuver, to Surratt.

Upon arrival at the scene, paramedics with the Sherman Fire Department used forceps to remove a plastic sandwich bag, containing an off white color substance, from Surratts throat. Surratt was transported to a local hospital where she was placed on life support. Ranger Oliver spoke with the medical staff who indicated Surratt had suffered from oxygen deprivation for over 7 minutes which had resulted in her being brain dead. On 09/02/2013, Surratt died in the hospital.
