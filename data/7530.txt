Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies fatally shot an unidentified man after he allegedly attacked one of them with a metal pole in the 3200 block of Burton Avenue at 12:08 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 1.

Deputies involved in the shooting had been called to investigate reports of an assault with a deadly weapon after the man allegedly stabbed his girlfriend with a long knife or sword, then ran away, said Sgt. Rich Pena of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Deputies set up a perimeter, using police dogs and helicopters to find the man inside an empty house, where he allegedly threatened them with the pole, Pena said. He injured one of the deputies, Pena said.

"They determined that the person was dangerous due to the crime he had already committed, and he attacked them with a metal weapon," Pena said. "Fearing for their safety, they took action."

Deputies fired at the man, who died at the scene. His girlfriend was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive. The injured deputy was treated at a hospital and released, Pena said.
