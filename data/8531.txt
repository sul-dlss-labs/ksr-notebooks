John Fulchiero, a 50-year-old white man, was shot by LAPD officers and died on Saturday, Oct. 17, in the 3100 block of Midvale Avenue in Palms, authorities said.

Officers had gone to the address after Fulchiero called police and said that he had killed his girlfriend and was going to kill himself, said LAPD Officer Norma Eisenman.

“The man kept going in and out of his home with the weapon in his hand,” she said.

About 3 a.m., police shot and killed Fulchiero outside the home when he pointed the weapon at officers, Eisenman said. A handgun was recovered from the scene, she said.

Fulchiero's girlfriend -- who was inside the home uninjured during the standoff -- told police that he was distraught over being an unemployed construction worker, according to Eisenman.
