Incident at 4323 Osby

October 23, 2006 -- A knife-wielding suspect who attempted to attack a Houston police officer was fatally shot at 4323 Osby about 1:15 a.m. today (October 23).

The suspect's identity is being withheld pending notification to family members.

The officer, Richard Kennedy, assigned to the Southwest Patrol Division and sworn in as an officer in August of 1999, was not injured.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeants C.W. Howard, M.W. McStravick and J. McGalin

reported:

Officer Kennedy was working an extra job, providing security services for the Willow Meadows subdivision when he encountered the suspect in the 4300 block of Wigton. The suspect fit the description of a knife-wielding suspect responsible for recent home invasions in the area. As Officer Kennedy approached the suspect, the suspect began yelling and behaving in an irate manner, before fleeing on foot.

The suspect hid in the backyard of a residence at 4323 Osby, but was located by Officer Kennedy and back-up officers. Officer Kennedy saw the suspect holding two knives and repeatedly gave him verbal commands to drop his weapons and lie on the ground. The suspect ignored all verbal commands, raised the knives, and charged at the officer. At that time, Officer Kennedy discharged his duty weapon and shot the suspect.

Officers on scene immediately called for medical assistance for the suspect, who was pronounced dead by paramedics.

As is customary in all officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney's office.
