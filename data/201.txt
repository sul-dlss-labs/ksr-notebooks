"He was very irate," Denver police Detective Virginia Lopez said of the victim. "It was obvious he was volatile." Police did not identify the man shot or the officers.

The 42-year-old man confronted the two police officers in the front yard of his home on the 2400 block of Irving Street after police were summoned there on a domestic disturbance call at 1:40 p.m.

Although the man had left his home by the time police arrived, he returned with weapons soon after, police said.

He was armed with an 18-inch pipe in one hand, and a serrated fishing knife in the other, Lopez said. She said the man backed the officers into the corner of a chain-link fence that encloses the front yard.

The officers warned the man repeatedly to drop his weapons, but he refused to do so, Lopez said. At one point, the officers sprayed Mace into the man's eyes, but he continued the threatening behavior, she said. Mace is usually an effective deterrent, Lopez said. "The officers, at that point, had to use deadly force," she said

Lopez did not identify the two officers. The victim was pronounced dead at Denver Health Medical Center.

She said the shooting appears to be justified. The Denver district attorney is investigating, which is standard procedure after any police shooting.

The scenes of domestic violence are often perilous for police officers.

The two most recent police shootings in the region occured when officers responded to domestic violence calls.

Colorado Springs police shot a man to death April 9 after responding to a domestic disturbance call. Officers opened fire after Richard Aubuchon, 28, pointed a handgun at them.

And in Westminster, police shot and killed 37-year-old Gregory A. Olsen as he was stabbing his estranged wife. Officers probably saved her life, authorities said.
