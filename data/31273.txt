Chandler police said a man killed himself Thursday afternoon while officers tried to detain him after they say he stole a vehicle.

The man stole a car at gunpoint in Mesa near South Country Club Drive and West Juanita Avenue about noon, according to Sgt. Jason McClimans of the Chandler Police Department. No victims were wounded during the incident, according to McClimans.

A helicopter from the Mesa Police Department followed the vehicle as the suspect drove into Chandler, according to McClimans. About 30 minutes later, the driver crashed near the intersection at Arizona Avenue and Frye Road while Chandler police were following the stolen car, McClimans said.

McClimans said officers tried to communicate with the driver, but he did not get outside of the car, and then took his life. The driver was armed with a gun and was the only person in the car, according to McClimans.

Chandler police did not release the identity of the man.

Mesa and Chandler police departments are investigating the suicide and robbery, McClimans said.
