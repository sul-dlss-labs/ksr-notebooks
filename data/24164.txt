A wanted man who was shot by Morristown police when he allegedly rammed officers' vehicles during an attempted escape Thursday morning has died, authorities said.

The suspect, identified as 46-year-old Kenneth Carter of Morristown, was pronounced dead at the University of Tennessee Medical Center in Knoxville, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

Officers attempted to take Carter into custody on several outstanding warrants as he sat in a vehicle on the 400 block of Hayter Drive about 9:30 a.m., according to a Morristown Police Department news release.

Carter used his car to ram officers in their vehicles in a bid to escape, the release states.

One officer shot into the car, striking Carter in his leg and lower abdomen with a .357-caliber handgun, according to the release.

A female passenger in the vehicle with the suspect at the time of the shooting was not hurt, said TBI spokeswoman Leslie Earhart. No officers were injured, either.

Details on the specific charges Carter was wanted for were not immediately available.

TBI agents are investigating the shooting at the request of 3rd District Attorney General Dan Armstrong.
