EVANSVILLE, Ind. â€” The armed man shot and killed by Evansville police on Sunday has been identified as Rodriguez Duandre Pam, 33, of Evansville, according to the Vanderburgh County Coroner's Office.

An autopsy is scheduled for 5 p.m. today.

Pam was killed by Evansville Police in a residential backyard Sunday night after refusing to comply with officer commands, police said.

According to Philip Smith, EPD special projects coordinator, 911 calls arrived Sunday night about an armed man in the 1100 block of Cherry Street, behind a home. The first call came at 8:18 p.m.

"The caller reported the person did not belong there," Smith said. "According to the caller, the person was armed with a firearm and threatening to shoot the caller's dog."

The woman told police the man pointed the firearm at her, Smith said.

Officers arrived a short time later and confronted the man, he said.

"They gave verbal commands to the suspect. The suspect did not comply. At least one EPD officer did fire a shot at the subject."

Police later said two officers fired several shots at the man hitting him "multiple times."

The man died at the scene, Smith said.

"We are processing the scene, talking to any witnesses that we can," he said. "Multiple witnesses have told us the officer did give commands to the suspect and (the person) didn't comply."

Smith said officers do not believe the caller knew the individual who confronted her in the backyard.
