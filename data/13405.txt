A former Philadelphia police sergeant has been sentenced to two to seven years in prison in an off-duty crash that killed another driver.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reports that 46-year-old Thomas Winkis pleaded no contest Monday to involuntary manslaughter and drunken driving.

Authorities said Winkis was driving between 93 and 103 mph in a 35 mph zone when he hit a van in September 2013 in northeast Philadelphia, killing 55-year-old David Farries.

The 21-year police veteran wiped away tears as the victim's daughter spoke emotionally about the loss. He apologized to the family, saying he hoped his actions "bring some closure to them."

Defense attorney Fortunato Perri Jr. said Winkis, who was assigned to special investigations and homeland security, retired immediately after the accident.
