A police officer responding to a report of a suspicious person fatally shot someone who jumped from bushes near the entrance of a mobile home park in Tustin on Monday, Aug. 9.

A resident living on the 15400 block of Williams St. summoned police at about 10:05 a.m., Tustin police Sgt. Matt Nunley said. When officers arrived, a man emerged from bushes near the entrance of the mobile home park and was “advancing on the officers,” Nunley wrote in a statement.

One officer shot and wounded that person, Nunley said. The injured man was then taken to a hospital and was later pronounced dead on Monday.

The man shot by police was holding some sort of object at the time, Nunley said. Department officials did not immediately specify what that item was.

No officers were hurt. Information on the dead man’s identity was not immediately known.
