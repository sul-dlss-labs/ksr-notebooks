*Updated 9/17/21 at 5:02 p.m. – The deceased individual has been identified as Andrew Christian (DOB: 1/17/87).

At the request of 30th District Attorney General Amy Weirich, TBI special agents are investigating the circumstances leading to the shooting of a man during the execution of arrest warrants out of Sumner County, Thursday afternoon.

At approximately 12:40 p.m., officers with the Multi-Agency Gang Unit attempted to serve arrest warrants to an individual at a home in the 2100 block of Ptarmigan Trail in Memphis. Officers made entry into the home in an attempt to find the individual. While inside the residence, officers were fired upon and at least one officer returned fire. At this time, all of the officers exited the house, two of whom jumped through a window and sustained injuries.

Members of the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office SWAT responded to the scene and made entry into the home. An individual was found deceased inside the residence from an apparent gunshot wound.

Both injured officers, a Memphis Police officer and a Shelby County Sheriff’s deputy were taken to an area hospital for treatment.

TBI agents are working to independently determine the series of events leading to the shooting, including collecting evidence and conducting interviews. Throughout the process, investigative findings will be shared with the District Attorney General for her further review and consideration. The TBI acts solely as fact-finders in its cases and does not determine whether the actions of an officer were justified in these types of matters. That decision rests with the District Attorney General requesting TBI’s involvement.

The TBI does not identify the officers involved in these types of incidents and instead, refers questions of that nature to the respective department to answer as it sees fit.
