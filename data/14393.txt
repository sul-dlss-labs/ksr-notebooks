KINGMAN â€” Authorities say a Kingman woman was fatally injured when her car collided with an SUV driven by a fugitive who ran a stop sign while being pursued by a state Department of Public Safety detective.

The collision that killed 66-year-old Linda Chevalier occurred Tuesday.

DPS spokesman Bart Graves said the detective was among members of a multi-agency task force trying to arrest 41-year-old Robert James Dodd on warrants for parole violation and auto theft.

Graves said Dodd was injured but is in custody and will face charges of murder and other crimes because of the collision.

The Department of Corrections lists Dodd as having absconded in 2013 after being released on Mohave County convictions for resisting arrest and flight.

Graves says DPS' investigation will include circumstances of the collision.
