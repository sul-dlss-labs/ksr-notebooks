A Mercer County man was shot and killed by South Brunswick police late Monday after he charged toward the officers with a knife after a high-speed chase on Route 1, the Middlesex County Prosecutor's Office said.

Jacob Olson, 23, of Ewing, was pronounced dead at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick at 12:03 a.m. today, less than an hour after the shooting, authorities said. A parked police cruiser initially attempted to stop Olson at 11:14 p.m. after observing his Jeep Compass speeding on Route 1 north near Raymond Road in South Brunswick, prosecutors said. The Jeep was traveling "well in excess of the 55 mph speed limit," according to a statement issued by the prosecutor's office.

During a chase that ensued, Olson suddenly slammed on the brakes and veered in front of the police cruiser, causing a collision, prosecutors said. The cruiser ended up in front of the Jeep, and Olson crashed his vehicle into the rear of the police car several times, prosecutors said.

Both cars eventually stopped at the intersection of Route 1 north and Route 522. Olson got out of the Jeep brandishing a knife, prosecutors said. He charged at the unidentified officer, who retreated while drawing his gun and ordering Olson to drop the knife, prosecutors said.

Another officer, who authorities did not identify, arrived and joined the original South Brunswick officer in ordering Olson to stop, prosecutors said. But Olson began moving toward the officers with the knife and they both opened fire, hitting Olson several times, prosecutors said.

An autopsy is scheduled for today and investigators are reviewing the video footage from the police cruiser involved in the pursuit. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call (732) 745-4328.
