TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - South Tucson police have confirmed the man shot by an officer Friday morning has died.

South Tucson's Chief of Police Michael Ford said officers were responding to a call about a man's erratic behavior at the Gospel Rescue Mission on 29th Street near Fifth Avenue around 3:42 a.m. Friday.

The man actively resisted officers who had been attempting to take him into custody, through less-lethal pepper spray and taser deployment, according to South Tucson police officials. The incident continued down 29th towards 6th Avenue.

According to South Tucson police the man had been actively attacking and charging the officers, when one of them fired his gun, hitting the man.

The Gospel Rescue Mission has issued the following statement:

"We are saddened at the loss of life. Some of those we serve have serious challenges, and during the holiday season it's especially important to remember those of us who are less fortunate, and to do what we can to help them."

Deputies with the Pima County Sheriff's Department are helping investigate the shooting.

However, while a deputy was responding to the scene around 6:30 a.m., they were involved in a rollover crash on 29th Street near 10th Avenue.

The deputy and the driver of the other vehicle are being evaluated, but both are expected to be OK.
