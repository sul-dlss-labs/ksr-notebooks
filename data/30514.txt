Officers reportedly ordered the man to drop the knife a number of times, she said.

The man refused to drop the knife and walked in and out of his house a number of times looking frustrated and irritated, Jimenez said. He then allegedly rushed toward the officers, who initially used less-lethal weapons to try to stop him, she said. When that did not work, an officer fired at the man, killing him, according to Jimenez.
