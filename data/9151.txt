In early March, people driving by the old Love's gas station building on North A were no doubt turning their head as they noticed a sign that read "Opening soon." How soon was up for speculation.

Months have past and the same sign is still up on the building that is to be a Jump Start/Conoco gas station and convenience store. The renovation process has been focused on the inside to this point, and according to the building owner, Mavid Haeri, the store will open next month.

"We're shooting for the middle of June," Haeri said via phone on Wednesday. "Renovation is going great, we kind of had a slow start...but it's looking great." Jump Start Office Manager, Barbara West also said the process is moving along.

"Just this week we've been getting our license...getting it set up," she said. "It's not going to be that much longer." Haeri said the next phase is to move outside to the fuel pumps. There are four pumps total at the location. The owner will be working on a new diesel pump and some new unleaded pumps.

Wellington City Manager Gus Collins said the inside looks "great" with all the work that's been done.

"Our enthusiasm has rekindled if you will," Collins said. "Hopefully it is going to be a reality very soon." Haeri also owns two Jump Starts in El Dorado along with seven more in Bartlesville, Okla.

Those who drive past the building on North A are still in high anticipation of the new store. Those involved with the project are also ready to get business going.

"We're just really anxious to get the doors opened," said West. "I know a lot of people are waiting as well."
