One person was killed and 10 others were injured Saturday evening when three people in a stolen vehicle led Chicago Police on a chase and eventually crashed into a van in the Englewood neighborhood on the South Side.

The vehicle sped away from police about 5:45 p.m., ran a stop sign then struck the van that was carrying 11 people near 71st Street and Carpenter Avenue, according to police.

Maria Carrion-Adame, a 37-year-old woman who lived near the crash site and was in the van, was taken to Stroger Hospital, where she died at 6:20 p.m., according to the Cook County medical examinerâ€™s office.

The Chicago Fire Department dispatched 11 ambulances and more than 50 personnel to the scene.

Authorities confirmed that six of the victims are children, ages 3, 5, 9, 13, and two 15-year-olds. A 56-year old was also hurt. Their conditions Sunday night ranged from good to critical.

Police said an investigation revealed the vehicle that fled from police was reported stolen. The three people inside the vehicle, all juveniles, were subsequently arrested and charged with felony possession of a stolen vehicle. They were not injured in the crash.
