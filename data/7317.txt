A police officer shot and killed a Middleburg Heights man early Sunday morning at the end of a standoff in which the man aimed a rifle at another officer.

Richard G. Sarver, 55, died around noon at MetroHealth Medical Center, according to the Cuyahoga County Coroner's Office.

The shooting ended a six-hour standoff with Sarver at his home at 1674 Fowles Road. Police had tazed Sarver, who went down. But as officers approached, Sarver - who is 6 foot 4 inches tall and weighs 250 pounds - removed one of the tazer prongs and raised his rifle at the office. A second officer then fired two three-round bursts from his mp5 submachine gun at Sarver, Middleburg Heights Police Chief John Maddox said.

The officer hit Sarver with all six shots.

Police were called to the area around 9 p.m. by residents who reported a man outside waving a gun. Once officers arrive, the man had gone back into his home. He would not come out, but police could see him through an open window.

The Middlebug Heights police called in the Southwest Enforcement Bureau Tactical Team, the region SWAT team.
