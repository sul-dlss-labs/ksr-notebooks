A man visiting family in Houston from San Antonio was shot and killed by police after he went on a shooting spree. The family of Lawrence Thompson III are absolutely heartbroken and confused as to how this all happened.

Houston police say around 4:30 p.m. Friday they received a call about shots fired near a home on the 100 block of East 44th Street near Yale. 32-year-old Lawrence Thompson III was dropped off by a friend at his sister’s house. When the friend exited the car, Thompson shot his friend in the yard unprovoked. He then shot another friend, and his own brother. He even struggled with his sister when she tried to grab the gun away from him. She was unsuccessful, and Thompson then shot at a pickup truck that was driving by. Thankfully the driver was not injured.

When police arrived they ordered Thompson to drop his gun. We’re told by police he instead threatened them with the semi automatic. He was shot multiple times by officer Joshua Steen, a first year patrol officer in the North Division. HPD is unsure if drugs played a role since the shootings.

Thompson’s father who witnessed the shooting tells us he tried to tell officers not to shoot his son, since he had a mental illness.

“I don’t even know if he had a gun in his hand or not,"Lawrence Thompson II says. "I couldn’t see nothing but his head. If he would’ve seen me he would’ve said 'daddy'. I know him when he gets in that state. He called on me, and if he called on me and if I seen him I would help him.” He was asked if his son was schizophrenic and he replied "yes". The three men, including the suspect’s brother are recovering in area hospitals and are expected to be OK, and as in most police involved shootings internal affairs and the Harris County District Attorney’s office will investigate this shooting.
