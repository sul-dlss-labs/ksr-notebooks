DETROIT â€” Police have identified a Detroit man found dead after exchanging gunfire with police following a crime spree in which two women were shot.

State police say Allan Farris' body was found Wednesday morning on the city's east side. Police didn't say in a news release if the 56-year-old Farris shot himself or if he was shot by officers.

The spree started about 9 p.m. Tuesday west of Detroit with an attempted carjacking and two carjackings that left two women wounded. A third woman was forced to drive into the Detroit enclave of Highland Park where she was dropped off.

About 3:30 a.m. Wednesday, Farris exchanged gunfire in Detroit with an undercover trooper he tried to carjack.

Police say shots also were fired when officers saw Farris behind a garage about four hours later. He later was found dead. No officers were wounded.

The women shot Tuesday were hospitalized in good condition.
