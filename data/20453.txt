CENTENNIAL, Colo. – A suspect shot by an Arapahoe County deputy following a carjacking in Centennial has died, the sheriff's office said Wednesday evening. Two other suspects remain at-large.

The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office first responded to a report of a car theft at East Broncos Parkway and South Jordan around 5 a.m. before receiving word that it was an armed carjacking.

A deputy in the area attempted to stop the stolen car but the driver sped away at highway speeds, deputies said.

Another deputy in the area of East Dry Creek Road and Yosemite Street spotted the suspect vehicle and immobilized it by hitting the suspects' vehicle in its rear quarter-panel. At that time, five suspects got out of the car and ran, deputies said.

The deputy began to chase one of the suspects, who officials said was armed with a gun. The deputy shot the man, now identified as James Daniel Hill, 17, who was taken to an area hospital.

Officials said a juvenile female suspect was taken into custody and Denver police caught up with a male suspect at the University light rail station. Two additional suspects, a male and female who are either juveniles or juvenile-looking, are still on the loose, deputies said. Both suspects are believed to be Hispanic. Deputies did not provide any further descriptions.

Four K-9 teams were assisting in the search for the outstanding suspects.

Deputies also said two elementary schools in the area were notified of the suspect search and each school had additional law enforcement officers on campus.
