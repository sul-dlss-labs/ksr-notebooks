A burglary call at Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School early this morning resulted in the death of a suspect who allegedly fled from Amarillo police officers.

Law enforcement officials have confirmed that Ryan Edward Griffin, 19, committed suicide in the parking lot of Woodlands Elementary School by shooting himself.

Police were called to the scene at 4:12 a.m. An official from the Amarillo Independent School District told officers that "a person in a dark hoodie" was inside the school.

Lt. Erick Bohannon, coordinator of the Potter-Randall Special Crimes Unit, said that as officers were speaking with the AISD official, Griffin exited the school and took off running.

Officers pursued Griffin south across Woodlands School Park, Bohannon said. Griffin then stopped near the playground, fired one shot into the ground, then ran into the parking lot nearby and shot himself in the head. Griffin was pronounced dead by Judge Thomas Jones and an autopsy has been scheduled for Friday in Lubbock.

Special Crimes investigators are treating the incident as a death in custody, since Griffin was evading arrest, Bohannon said.

Lorenzo de Zavala Middle School and Woodlands Elementary School were been closed on Thursday. Classes are expected to resume on Friday.
