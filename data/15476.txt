Speed and alcohol were factors in the deaths of three men who were pursued by officers and died in a single-car accident in Anderson County, Coroner Greg Shore said Saturday.

The men, all of Anderson, were identified as: Brandon Charles Franks, 34, Alex Reyna Garcia, 45, and Jose Medrano Castillo, 54. Franks was driving and tested positive for several drugs, Shore said.

An Anderson County deputy began following Franks on Friday evening after he saw him traveling at a high rate of speed in a 2005 Hyundai Sonata, Shore said. The officer attempted to stop Franks near 28 Bypass and Michelin Boulevard, but he did not stop and continued on Michelin, Shore said. Other officers then joined the chase.

Deputies pursued Franks for several miles throughout the west side and south end of Anderson, Shore said, before returning to 28 Bypass near a Walmart. Shore said heavy traffic was in the area and deputies lost sight of the vehicle.

An officer later located the wrecked Sonata about 6 p.m. on Jasmine Drive, in a neighborhood just west of Anderson city limits, authorities said. The car went off the right side of the road and hit a tree, which on the driver's door. All three men died of blunt force trauma, Shore said.

The Highway Patrol accident reconstruction unit is investigating, authorities said.
