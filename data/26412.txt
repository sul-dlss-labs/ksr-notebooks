An Otsego County Sheriff's deputy is recovering after a head-on crash Tuesday with a suspect who died while allegedly fleeing from law enforcement in Richfield Springs.

The investigation remained ongoing Wednesday. New York State Police said it began when troopers approached the suspect in a vehicle around 2:30 p.m., after getting a complaint about the suspect harassing and threatening another person with a knife.

A pursuit onto Route 20 ensued after the suspect, Matthew E. All, 23, of Sharon Springs, allegedly fled from troopers.

The pursuit continued east, and troopers said All reached the intersection of routes 20 and 80.

By that point, Otsego County Sheriff's Deputy James Mateunas was parked in his patrol vehicle, facing west and monitoring the pursuit with his emergency lights activated.

For an unknown reason, troopers said, All drove into oncoming traffic and struck Mateunas' patrol vehicle head-on.

Mateunas was taken to Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown. His injuries were described as serious but not life-threatening. Troopers described him as still being "coherent" at the scene of the crash.

All was pronounced deceased at the scene by Otsego County Corner Michael Fox.

The Otsego County Sheriffâ€™s Office, in a statement on Facebook, asked the public to "keep Deputy Sheriff James Mateunas and his family in your prayers."
