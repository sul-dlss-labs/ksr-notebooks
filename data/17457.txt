Original:

A terminally ill man died after an officer-involved shooting in Cape Coral Thursday evening.

It is unclear if the man died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound or if he was struck by a police officer.

The incident occurred in the 4200 block of NW 12 street after police responded to the home in reference to a terminally ill man with a gun, according to a Cape Coral Police Department news release.

As officers arrived at the home, the man came outside and shot at police officers, according to police. No officers were injured in the incident.

One officer returned fire and the man went back into his home. Police say officers heard a shot from within the house and once they made entry, they found the man dead.
