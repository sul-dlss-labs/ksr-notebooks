Two Eau Claire County residents facing criminal charges in Wisconsin were killed early Saturday in a traffic crash in Colorado after a confrontation with a Colorado State Patrol trooper.

The crash, involving Jonathan P. Holum, 29, and Cora J. Weil, 24, occurred at 12:42 a.m. on Colorado 82 south of Glenwood Springs, which is about 125 miles west of Denver.

“This is a tragedy that absolutely did not have to happen,” State Patrol spokesman David Hall told the Glenwood Springs Post Independent newspaper.

According to the Colorado State Patrol:

A trooper initiated a traffic stop at 12:29 a.m. after seeing a black Ford pickup bearing Wisconsin license plates traveling west on Colorado 82 and weaving across the center and fog lines.

After obtaining information from Holum — the driver whom the trooper suspected of drunken driving — the trooper returned to her patrol car as another trooper arrived on scene.

As the initiating officer went to the pickup a second time, Holum and Weil fled in their vehicle at about 12:37 a.m., with both troopers in pursuit.

Speeds reached 90 mph during the chase. Traveling about 60 mph, Holum attempted to force one of the patrol cars off the road, but he lost control of the vehicle, which spun sideways before rolling over.

Neither Holum nor Weil were wearing seat belts and were ejected from the truck. Weil was pronounced dead at the scene, and Holum was transported to Valley View Hospital in Glenwood Springs, where he was pronounced dead at 2:11 a.m. Neither trooper was injured.

According to Wisconsin court records, a warrant for Weil’s arrest was issued Jan. 23 in Eau Claire County, the same day a burglary charge was filed against her.

Bench warrants for Holum’s arrest were issued in February in Dunn, Eau Claire and Pepin counties. He was facing multiple charges at the time of his death, including several for burglary, criminal damage to property and theft.
