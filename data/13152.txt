(WMC-TV) - Police identify the man who took his own life after a police chase Tuesday as 51-year-old Marvin Amerson.

Just before 10 a.m., officers responded to the Wells Fargo at 6445 Poplar Avenue where a man wearing a black ski mask reportedly robbed the bank with a gun. The suspect fled on foot.

Shortly afterward, witnesses told police the bank robbery suspect had gotten into a white van. A Memphis police officer spotted the vehicle heading westbound on Poplar Avenue. Amerson eventually stopped on I-240 and officers say they could see him pointing a gun to his head. He refused to get out of the vehicle.

According to police, he started driving again and took the Walnut Grove Road exit. Amerson eventually crashed into two other vehicles at the intersection of Walnut Grove and Perkins Extended.

Officers say they could see Amerson pointing a gun at his head again. He refused to surrender to police and eventually shot himself.

A handgun and black plastic bag of cash were found inside his vehicle.
