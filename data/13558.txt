The Pinellas-Pasco State Attorney cleared four St. Petersburg police officers in the shooting death of a Pinellas Park man last month.

Jason M. Kerr, 31, was shot to death on the evening of Oct. 17 after investigators said he opened fire on police.

Prior to that, police said they had received a call about a man with a gun at Hungry Baba's on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Street S.



Police arrived at the scene and saw Kerr driving away in a white Dodge Caravan. The officers followed Kerr in marked cruisers with their lights on and tried to pull him over.



That's when police said Kerr drove into the parking lot of Snax Convenience Store and started firing at the officers' cruisers. Three bullets hit two cruisers.



The officers returned fire and hit Kerr, who died. No one else was injured in the shooting.

Investigators said they later spoke to the woman who had two children with Kerr, and she told them Kerr had called her and said he planned to die that night.

"Kerr told her that he had no hope and wanted to die," the letter said.

Toxicology reports indicated Kerr had a blood alcohol level of .179 and marijuana in his system at the time of the shooting.

On Friday, State Attorney Bernie McCabe's office sent a letter to Police Chief Chuck Harmon detailing the findings of their investigation into the shooting.

In it, McCabe wrote that Officers Matthew Stringfellow, Scott Kirpan, Matthew Laliberte and Mark Kruzell were "in the lawful performance of their legal duty" when they shot and killed Kerr.

The St. Petersburg Police Department is still conducting its own administrative investigation, and the officers involved are still on administrative duties pending the outcome of the shooting review board.
