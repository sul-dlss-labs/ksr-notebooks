Another neighbor, David Cordero, was less sympathetic. “The guy got what was coming to him, may he rest in peace,” Mr. Cordero said. “The guy cut up his roommate and charged the police with a bottle.”

It was the second fatal shooting by the police in Brooklyn in a week. Last Monday night, Khiel Coppin, a troubled 18-year-old, was shot dead outside his Bedford-Stuyvesant home by five officers who fired 20 shots after he pulled a hairbrush from under his sweatshirt as if it were a gun. The police called that shooting justified, although the youth’s family and its lawyer insisted it was not.

While there were similarities, including bizarre behavior by the victims, the circumstances of the two shootings differed sharply. Experts on police work noted that yesterday’s shooting arose from the menace of a broken bottle, a potentially deadly weapon. The police began an internal inquiry, but did not say whether the shooting appeared to be justified or to fall within departmental guidelines.

The officers who shot Mr. Kostovski were both members of the 75th Precinct, as were the two police witnesses, but aside from saying that both had been members of the force for about two years, no information about them was disclosed. No civilian eyewitnesses were found, despite a daylong canvass of the area, although a woman at home nearby heard the officers’ command and the gunshots.

The officers fired 9-millimeter automatic pistols, but were not armed with Tasers, which stun with electronic charges and are carried only by some special units. The police declined to name the officers, and investigators were not allowed to speak to them, a common practice in police shootings to avoid compromising any investigation by a prosecutor or grand jury.
