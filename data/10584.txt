Noel Salinas, identified by the coroner's office as a 49-year-old white man, was shot and killed by authorities Thursday, Sept. 15, in the 13900 block of Van Ness Avenue in Gardena, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Ed Winter, spokesman for the coroner's office, said Salinas was having an argument with the manager of a residence about 12:33 p.m. when he pulled out a gun.

Authorities were called and officials attempted to subdue Salinas, Winter said, but they were unsuccessful. At that point, an officer-involved shooting occurred.

Salinas was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 7:01 p.m. Coroner's records show he had several gunshot wounds to the upper torso.

Anyone with information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to call the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
