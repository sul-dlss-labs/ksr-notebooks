The Lubbock Sheriff's Office late Monday released the name of a man who died Saturday after being shot by a deputy with a stun gun.

Donacio Rendon, 43, died after deputies used TASERs to subdue him.

Deputies responded to a domestic violence callout in the 1500 block of East County Road 7160, in which the caller stated a man was "on drugs and acting crazy," Lt. Jason Stewart said in a statement released Monday.

Rendon was found hiding under a nearby house and ran from deputies, according to the statement.

Deputies eventually caught Rendon and fired a TASER at Rendon.

He was placed in a patrol car, where he tried to kick out a window, according to the statement.

Deputies opened the door and Rendon escaped.

Deputies noticed Rendon was becoming unresponsive after subduing him a second time and began CPR while waiting for EMS, according to the statement.

EMS arrived and took Rendon to University Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

The Lubbock County Medical Examiner's Office is conducting an autopsy, and the results were not expected Monday, Stewart said in the statement.
