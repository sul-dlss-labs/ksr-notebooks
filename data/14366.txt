ST. LOUIS COUNTY â€¢ A St. Louis man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with a 2014 robbery in which his accomplice was fatally shot by police.

Jabari A. Quarles, 26, of the 5200 block of Enright Avenue in St. Louis, was sentenced on charges of second-degree murder (also called felony murder), robbery, felonious restraint and armed criminal action. Quarles pleaded guilty to those charges Wednesday and was sentenced by St. Louis County Circuit Judge Michael Jamison.

He and Claudell Webb Jr., 23, of Ferguson, robbed the Check 'n Go in the Gravois Bluffs Shopping Center, 676 Gravois Boulevard, about 10:30 a.m. April 16, 2014, police said. They showed weapons, tied up two store workers and took cash and car keys.

Charges said that when the suspects were confronted by St. Louis County officers outside the store, Webb pulled out a Tec-9 with an extended clip holding 30 rounds.

During a struggle with police, a St. Louis County officer shot Webb once in the chest, killing him, police said. Police recovered Webb's gun at the scene. Quarles surrendered peacefully, police said.
