Police where chasing a pickup truck traveling at estimated speeds of more than 100 miles per hour. The truck was weaving into oncoming traffic on Michigan Ave. and blowing red lights.

Finally, the driver of the truck struck a red minivan, sideswiped another vehicle and crashed into a utility pole in front of Telway diner near Michigan and Martin before exploding.

Michigan State Police Trooper John Gora said the driver of the truck died and the other two drivers suffered minor injuries.

Gora says the vehicle was stolen from the Detroit suburb of Taylor. It belonged to a Monroe resident.

Police have not determined the identity of the dead driver and did not immediately release the names of the other drivers.

"The moment it stopped it just burst into flames," Earl Owen, the owner of the Telway, told Fox 2, saying the driver probably would have crashed into his restaurant had it not been for the light post.
