A man is dead after he allegedly charged Grantsville police officers with a knife and one of them shot him.

On Wednesday at about 6:10 p.m., according to the Grantsville Police Department, officers tried to stop a car they said was driven by a man wanted in connection with an Internet Crimes Against Children case. Following a “brief pursuit” on S.R. 112 between Tooele and Erda, the suspect stopped his car, got out and “charged officers with a knife.”

One of the officers fired his gun at the suspect, striking him. Despite life-saving efforts, he died at the scene. His name has not been released.

The shooting is under investigation and Grantsville police provided no further information.

It was the second time in 20 hours that a Utah police officer shot and killed someone. On Tuesday night, detectives from the Pleasant Grove Police Department and the Utah County Sheriff’s Office shot Paul Rasmussen, 48, after he allegedly pointed a gun at them.

The latest police shooting is the 20th in Utah this year. There had been 19 by Aug. 27 last year. There were 30 police shootings in 2020, matching the record set in 2018.
