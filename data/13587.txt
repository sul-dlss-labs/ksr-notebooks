A suspect was shot and killed by Clayton County police during a roadside struggle with an officer that played out in the middle of Thursday’s Interstate 75 morning commute, authorities said.

The incident happened around 7:45 a.m. alongside I-75 northbound, just south of Old Dixie Highway overpass.

A suspicious person was standing next to a vehicle on the right shoulder of the expressway, Clayton County police spokesman Gary Syblis said.

Clayton County police Capt. Steve Branham said an officer on his way to work “witnessed what appeared to be a crime in progress.” Branham gave no details on that alleged crime.

The officer exited his vehicle and began to talk to the suspect, who became combative, started to fight and tried to take the officer’s weapon, Syblis said.

“The officer was able to maintain control of his weapon and, fearing for his life, was able to stop the actions of the suspect, by firing a shot,” Syblis said in a news release. The suspect died at the scene.

A source from the GBI said 47-year-old Michael Clifford Garmon of McDonough was the man who died after he allegedly tried to grab the gun from a Clayton County police officer.

Police said the officer confronted Garmon after he was spotted trying to break into an abandoned car on I-75 near old Dixie Highway Thursday morning.

Authorities wrapped up their investigation of the shooting just south of the Old Dixie Highway overpass. Traffic is again moving smoothly, but it was just the opposite following the confrontation and shooting around 8 a.m.
