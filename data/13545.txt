Northeast Iowa man dies after domestic violence incident, wife hospitalized

The Oelwein man who was charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting his wife has now died from his self-inflicted wounds.

According to Oelwein Police Chief Jeremy Logan, 44-year-old Myron Meador died Wednesday night at University of Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City. Meador and his wife, 38-year-old Niki, were transferred to Iowa City, from Mercy Hospital in Oelwein, following the apparent murder-suicide attempt Tuesday morning.

Oelwein police were called out at about 7 AM Tuesday, on the report of shots being fired inside the Meadorsâ€™ home on the northwest side of town. When officers arrived, more gunshots were heard coming from inside the home.

Myron Meador, who had allegedly shot himself, exited the home and was taken into custody. Authorities then entered the home and found Niki Meador suffering from several bullet wounds.

According to Chief Logan, Myron was pronounced dead last night, and Niki remains hospitalized, although a condition report was not available.

Myron was convicted of domestic violence with a different woman in Black Hawk County about 10 years ago; Niki obtained a no-contact order against Myron last year, but it was lifted a few days later.
