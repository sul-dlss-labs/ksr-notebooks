Chicago police used a stun gun twice without success on a knife-wielding man Thursday night during a domestic dispute in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, then shot and killed him after he lunged at them, police said.

No one else was hurt.

The man was identified Friday by the Cook County medical examiner's office as Alvin Nash, 44, of the 2000 block of West 51st Street.

When they arrived, officers found Nash holding a knife against his throat.

The officers ordered him to drop the knife, but he wouldn't, police said. One of the officers used a stun gun in an attempt to subdue him, without effect.

Nash then held the knife against his wife's neck, and the officers ordered him again to drop the knife, police said. An officer used the stun gun a second time, also with no effect.

"The [man] then lunged toward the officers with the knife. As a result of this action, an officer discharged his weapon, striking and fatally wounding the [man]," police said in a statement Friday.

Nash was pronounced dead at 9:38 p.m. in Stroger Hospital. He was shot multiple times.

Investigators from the Independent Police Review Authority, which investigates shootings involving Chicago police, were on the scene Friday, authority spokesman Curtis Tarver said.
