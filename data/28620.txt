A domestic situation at a Blaine residence ended Monday evening with a man and woman dead in what appeared to be a murder-suicide, authorities said, while two juveniles in the home were rescued.

The victims were identified as Maksim Aleksandrovich Krechetov, 44, and Yulia Khort, 47, both of Blaine. According to the Sheriff's Office, the evidence suggests that Krechetov shot and killed Khort, and then used a gun to take his own life. Authorities said there was no danger to the community.

Law enforcement officers and the Anoka County SWAT team set up a perimeter around the home, in the 600 block of NE. 120th Avenue, after being called there on a domestic situation about 8:35 p.m. Monday.

They learned a man inside had a gun and attempted to contact the adults in the home. But they later heard multiple shots from inside the residence, said Tierney Peters with the Sheriff's Office, and entered the home to find Krechetov and Khort dead.
