Recorded radio traffic captures a North Carolina police officer telling a suspect to put his gun down during a confrontation that ended with an officer injured and the suspect dead.

In the audio of the Monday confrontation released by the Raleigh Police Department, an officer is heard saying "put the gun down, bro" and telling the dispatcher that the suspect won't do so.

He later says an officer has been shot in the leg and that the suspect is covered, although still with his hand on a handgun.

Officials said 24-year-old Jaqwan Julius Terry of Raleigh was killed during the encounter, which happened after police responded to reports of someone with a gun.

The injured officer was identified as 29-year-old B.F. Burleson. Authorities say his injuries aren't life-threatening. Authorities did not release either man's race.
