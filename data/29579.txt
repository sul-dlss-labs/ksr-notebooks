McCURTAIN COUNTY, Okla. (KSLA) — A 39-year-old man is dead as a result of an officer-involved shooting.

It happened Sunday evening in the Golden-Glover area west of Broken Bow in McCurtain County, Okla.

The McCurtain County Sheriff’s Office received a call at 5:20 p.m. Sunday, Jan. 31, about a domestic assault occurring in the 1700 block of Lavender Road in Broken Bow, according to a Facebook page by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigations.

The sheriff told KSLA News 12′s Doug Warner that his deputies responded to a domestic disturbance during which a man was attacking his mother.

“It was reported that 39-year-old Franklin Gray was holding his mother down on a couch and she was having trouble breathing,” according to the the OSBI’s post.

When the three deputies got on the scene, they found Gray outside the residence and tried to take him into custody but he began fighting them.

“At one point during the struggle, Gray attempted to take one deputy’s gun, ripping the holster from the deputy’s belt, at which point the weapon discharged,” the OSBI reports.

Deputies tased Gray in an attempt to get the situation under control, which was unsuccessful and the altercation continued.

Gray was shot during the altercation and died at the scene.

No deputy was injured.

All three deputies have been placed on administrative leave, as is routine in such matters.
