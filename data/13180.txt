The Stoughton Fire Department again is flying its 30-foot by 60-foot United States flag downtown in commemoration of Sept. 11 on the 12th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, said Fire Department Chief Mark Dolloff.

The flag, which will fly off a ladder truck, was put up this morning for commuters to see. It will remain in the air through nighttime. Last year, the flag flew until about 9 p.m. thanks to a “huge turnout,” Dolloff said.

“It’s an impressive sight,” he said. “You can see it down Route 138 in both directions.”

There was a short memorial service this morning under the flag, which members of the Stoughton Police Department also attended.
