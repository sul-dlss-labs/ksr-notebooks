MILWAUKEE — A 46-year-old man is dead after a police chase Saturday night in Milwaukee ended in a crash, killing an innocent driver in another vehicle.

Milwaukee police said it started around 9:10 p.m. when officers tried to pull over a vehicle that was speeding near 28th and Galena.

The driver kept going, and within a minute, ran a stop sign and crashed into another car by 35th and Walnut. It caused that car to roll onto its roof, killing the driver inside, a 46-year-old man.

Police said the driver of the vehicle that hit it ran from the scene, but eventually police arrested a 46-year-old man and a 48-year-old woman in connection to the incident.

Lisa Cruz heard the crash at her home down the block.

“It was horrific,” Cruz said.

She went outside and walked to the intersection to see a sea of flashing lights.

“All of the cops are trying to you know bang on the door, trying to get it open and they can’t,” Cruz said. “It’s just a little bit overwhelming to see and to see somebody there not responding.”

Sierra Boyce grew up in the neighborhood. Her mom still lives there.

“I was on the phone with my mom and she screamed out ‘ooo something bad happened right there at the corner!’” Boyce said.

She said she wishes the driver would have stopped, instead of leading police on a chase.

“Somebody is out here crying right now because they have lost their loved one,” Boyce said.

Boyce and Cruz said the reckless driving in the city is out of control.

“It just seems like they don’t care about anybody else but themselves,” Cruz said.

They feel it’s time for drivers to change their behavior and respect others on the roads.

“Everybody need to just drive safe and stop killing people that ain’t doing nothing. Everybody just want to live their life,” Boyce said.

Police have yet to release the names of the man who was killed or the suspects. Charges are pending.
