Teddie Whitefield, the former Wichita Falls police officer who was involved in the fatal car accident on Jacksboro Highway in July of 2011, has turned himself in to authorities this morning. 18 year old Yeni Lopez and her unborn child, as well as 13-year-old Gloria Montoya, were all killed when the vehicle they were driving was struck by Whitefield's police cruiser.

A Texas Department of Public Safety investigation showed that Whitefield was traveling around 80 mph at the time of the collision and had Xanax and a prescription strength diet drug in his system.

Whitefield was charged with three counts of manslaughter, each with a $25,000 bond. Whitefield arrived at the Wichita County jail with his lawyer and a bondsman around 9:30 am this morning (March 23) and turned himself in. Shortly after turning himself in, he posted bail.
