Troopers in Fairbanks were involved in a shooting Saturday around 5:00 a.m. that left one man dead, and a trooper injured.

Col. Barry Wilson, director of the State Troopers, tells the newspaper that Shawn Ray Wilson, 48, of Fairbanks pulled out a weapon as troopers attempted to take him into custody about 5 a.m. Saturday.

Wilson says the troopers were trying to serve a search warrant and a $100,000 arrest warrant on charges of forgery and theft.

Wilson adds: "As troopers attempted to take Mr. Wilson into custody, he pulled a weapon and shot at and hit a trooper attempting to use less than lethal means of force on Mr. Wilson."

Wilson says a second trooper shot at the suspect, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

He says the injured trooper was treated for his injuries at Fairbanks Memorial Hospital and released.
