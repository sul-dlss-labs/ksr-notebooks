WALKER, LA (WAFB) - One man is dead after a short stand-off early Monday morning.

It happened on Corbin Avenue in Walker after Livingston Parish Sheriff's were called to the residence for a domestic dispute.

Livingston Parish Chief Deputy Jason Ard says an LPSO deputy shot and killed the man Jonathan Clayton, 22, after an altercation involving a weapon.

Witnesses say the man's girlfriend was seen bleeding from the head but appeared to be conscious and alert. It is unclear how she sustained her injuries.

Investigators with the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office are on the scene, as well as the Louisiana State Police. It is routine for an outside agency to handle shooting investigations involving other deputies or officers.
