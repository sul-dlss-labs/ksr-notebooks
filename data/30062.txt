WELD COUNTY, Colo. — The Weld County Sheriff's Office (WCSO) and other agencies responded to a disturbance that ended in officers shooting and killing a suspect Saturday morning in a subdivision northeast of Fort Lupton, according to the WCSO.

The agencies responded at 8:43 a.m. to a call of a disturbance in a residential community called Aristocrat Ranchettes, in unincorporated Weld County just northeast of Fort Lupton, a WCSO spokesman said.

A female caller had reported to 911 that a man armed with a gun was threatening to kill her and preventing her from leaving the house, according to WCSO.

When officers arrived on scene, they found the 60-year-old man, identified as Smoky Lynn Crockett, outside the house and ordered him to drop his weapon. After several more minutes, officers shot and killed Crockett, the spokesman said.

WCSO did not say whether Crockett fired his weapon or whether anyone else was injured in the incident.

The 19th Judicial Critical Incident Response Team will investigate the officer-involved shooting. Anyone with information can call Detective John Kinne with the Greeley Police Department at 970-350-9603.
