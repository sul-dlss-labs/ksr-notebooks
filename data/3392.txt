An Anaheim man with a knife, who had had previous run-ins with the law, was shot and killed by police after chasing a woman at a residential motel, Anaheim police reported Monday.

Brett Alan Cherry, 37, died shortly after the shooting, which occurred at 9:45 p.m. Sunday at the El Dorado Inn in the 3300 block of West Lincoln Avenue, according to Police Sgt. Rick Martinez.

Police arrived within two minutes of receiving a call about an armed man, Martinez said.

About 30 minutes later they reported that they had fatally shot him inside a room.

“What led up to it, we have to talk to the officers involved,” Martinez said.

Police did not say how many officers were present, how many shots were fired, release the name of the woman or her relationship to Cherry.

Cherry was charged in 1990 in Los Angeles County with brandishing a deadly weapon at a police officer to resist or prevent from being arrested, according to court records.

In Orange County in 1991, he was charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.

Cherry’s family could not be reached for comment.

The district attorney’s office is investigating the Sunday shooting, which is standard with officer-involved shootings.
