PORTSMOUTH – Optima Bank & Trust, a locally-owned, commercial bank headquartered in Portsmouth, held its annual Shareholders Meeting on April 16 announcing positive results for 2014 as well as an outlook for 2015 and a vision for the bank’s future.

At the meeting held at the Portsmouth Country Club, Daniel Morrison, chairman, president & CEO reported another year of solid growth and record earnings. Morrison attributed continued strong core asset and earnings growth to the bank's investment in its full-service branches allowing for increased market penetration, together with his staff's dedicated efforts to provide high-quality customer service to businesses and individuals throughout the Seacoast and most recently the Manchester market.

Morrison reported for 2014, net income was $1,638,000, more than double the Bank’s net income of just over $800,000 in 2013. Net income per share was $0.84 for 2014, an increase of 104% over the $0.41 per share for 2013.

Total assets grew by 13% to $318 million from $282 million at December 31, 2013. In 2014, total loans grew by 15% from $230 million to $264 million, and total deposits grew by 13% from $261 million to $294 million. Net interest income, the Bank’s primary revenue source, was $9.6 million in 2014, up 24% from 2013, and non-interest income was $1.1 million, up 82%.

On Jan. 28, Optima celebrated its seventh anniversary, which means bank regulators no longer consider Optima Bank a de novo bank. This is a big milestone for the bank. According to FDIC data, Optima Bank & Trust has gained more deposit market share in the seacoast region of New Hampshire than any other bank in the past seven years.

Morrison reported that the outlook for 2015 is very positive. The Bank is off to an excellent start and expects to post record earnings again in 2015. First quarter earnings were up 24% from a year ago, and asset growth continues to be very strong.

Optima Bank & Trust now has six locations, including five full-service branches and one loan office. There are two locations in Portsmouth, one downtown and another at the Pease International Tradeport. There is a branch on Route One in North Hampton and another on Route 108 in Stratham. There is a loan office on Central Avenue in Dover, and the newest full-service branch is located on South River Road in Bedford. The Bank currently employs more than 60 full-time employees at its six locations.

Morrison explained that the Bank’s Board of Directors are committed to continued growth and expansion, with plans over the next several years to add additional locations throughout the state.

“Our outlook for continued growth is very favorable. Over the next several years, we expect to have expanded to possibly 10 locations, and perhaps 100 employees,” said Morrison.
