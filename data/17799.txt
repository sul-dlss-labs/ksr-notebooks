A motorcyclist fleeing from police was killed in a crash Saturday night.

An officer attempted to stop the cyclist for a traffic violation near 14th and High streets around 9:45 p.m. He rode into a convenience store parking lot indicating that he was stopping, then accelerated rapidly out of the lot.

The officer didn't pursue the motorcyclist and quickly lost sight of him due to the high speed. While checking the area, police came upon an accident scene where 25-year-old Vincent Quang of Des Moines was found dead.
