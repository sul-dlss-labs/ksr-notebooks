The Colorado Bureau of Investigation are investigating a deadly officer-involved shooting that happened Thursday night.

It began just after 9 when officers with the Trinidad Police Department were called to 705 W. Adams Street in Trinidad for a reported disturbance.

When officers arrived, they noticed a broken window in the front of the house. Police went inside the home, where they say a man advanced toward them while holding a large piece of broken glass in his hand.

Officers then fired at the man. He was pronounced dead on scene. The identity of that man has not yet been released.
