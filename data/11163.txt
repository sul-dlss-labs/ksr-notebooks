Garmik Kirakosian, a 30-year-old Armenian man, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, March 21, in the 10700 block of La Tuna Canyon Road in Shadow Hills, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Police said they responded to reports of a robbery about 12:45 p.m. on Glenoaks Boulevard. When they arrived, they found that an employee had been shot in the leg.

Moments later, the suspect, later identified as Kirakosian, allegedly carjacked a woman in a Mercedes and drove off with the victim still inside the car, police said.

Authorities chased the Mercedes until Kirakosian crashed into a pillar near Wheatland and La Tuna Canyon Road. He then ran away.

Police shot him after he pointed a weapon at them, according to preliminary reports by the LAPD. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Anyone with additional details about the shooting is asked to contact the Los Angeles Police Department at (877) 527-3247. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
