Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 8301 Ley Road Identified July 16, 2009 - Houston police have learned the identity of the armed male suspect who fired at least one shot at Houston police officers and was fatally shot by officers at 8301 Ley Road about 2:45 a.m. on Tuesday (July 14). The suspect has been identified as Tony Wayne Johnson (b/m, DOB: 2-23-80). Johnson suffered multiple gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene. Six Northeast Patrol Division officers who discharged their weapons were not injured. They are K.D. Eichman (sworn in as an officer in December 2002), E.T. Fendia (sworn in in January 2007), D.K. Marshall (sworn in in November 2006), T.M. Reese (sworn in in December 1993), N.G. Tovar III (sworn in in December 1995) and D. Villarreal Jr. (sworn in in June 2009). HPD Homicide Division Sergeant W.P. Booth and Senior Police Officer A.D. Brown reported: Johnson was driving a white Mitsubishi Mirage when he crashed through a security gate at the HPD Northeast Patrol Station. He drove around the back of the station where he struck a parked vehicle, another security gate, and a marked police car. Johnsonâ€™s vehicle then came to rest after striking a fence. Several patrol officers near the station's prisoner unloading area investigated the crash, at which time Johnson, who was still in the car, pointed a gun at them. Officers discharged their weapons at Johnson and took cover. Johnson, who was naked, got out of the car and again pointed the gun and fired at the officers, who then returned fire. Officers eventually gained control of Johnson, and called for medical assistance, however, he died at the scene. It was learned Johnson had led Aldine Independent School District officers on a high speed vehicle pursuit, while holding a gun against his head. As is customary in officer-involved shooting incidents in the city limits, the case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions, as well as the Harris County District Attorney's Office.
