CHICAGO (CBS) -- A man is dead after being shot by police following a car theft in Bloomingdale and threatening police with a knife, Bloomingdale police say.

Police were called to the Walmart at 314 W. Army Trail Road in Bloomingdale for the report of a subject with a knife. Officers say when they arrived a woman told them her car was stolen by the man.

Police say the man fled in the car heading southbound on Schmale Road before turning eastbound onto Mill Pond Drive and then southbound onto Chippendale Lane in Glendale Heights.

The man then exited the car brandishing a knife at the officers who were giving commands, police say.

The man then faced officers and "moved rapidly towards them holding the knife in a threatening manner," according to Bloomingdale police.

Officers fired at the man, striking him. They immediately administered first aid until emergency medical personnel arrived and took over.

The man was pronounced dead on the scene.

There is no danger to the public, and this was an isolated incident, according to a Facebook post by Bloomingdale police.

The DuPage County Major Crimes Task Force and the DuPage County State's Attorney's Office are on the scene investigating.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Bloomingdale Police Department at (630)529-9868.
