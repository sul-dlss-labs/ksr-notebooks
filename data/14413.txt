MERCED, Calif. (KFSN) -- Authorities have just released the identity of the woman killed by Merced police this weekend.

She is 27-year-old Kandice Honiker. Investigators say the incident started when Honiker and 24-year-old Nathan Jones robbed two people Friday night and early Saturday morning.

Tuesday, Chief Norm Andrade said officers tried to stop the suspects in their car, but they sped away and ran several stop signs before crashing into a curb at V Street.

Authorities quickly arrested Jones, but they say Honiker pointed a black handgun at officers before running away and firing one round during the chase.

Two officers finally caught up with her in an alley. That's where Chief Andrade says she pointed the gun at them for a second time, and officers opened fire.
