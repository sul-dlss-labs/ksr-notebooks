Michigan State Police say an officer in mid-Michigan fatally shot a 16-year-old vehicle break-in suspect after the teen fired at the officer during a foot chase.

Midland Police say officers responded to the scene around 1:40am Monday to a report of two people breaking into a vehicle. When they got there two teens took off running.

During the chase one of the suspects revealed a weapon and shot at the officer, and police say the officer returned fire. The teen was pronounced dead at the scene. No officers were injured.

The other 16-year-old break-in suspect was arrested, and is in custody at the Midland Juvenile Care Center.

The officer is identified as a 19-year veteran of the department and has been placed on paid administrative leave.

The results of an investigation by state police are expected to be reviewed by prosecutors.
