A man was fatally shot in Sanger Monday night after he pointed a weapon at a Denton County Sheriff's Deputy, according to a statement from the Denton County Sheriff's Office.

Around 5:45 p.m. in the 4300 block of View Road in Sanger, deputies with the Denton County Sheriffâ€™s Office Warrants Division were trying to find a suspect wanted on felony warrants in Flordia. They were investigating a string of vehicle thefts and burglaries in the area and were told that a stolen car was in that block of View Road.

A woman told officers that the man, 37-year-old Kristopher Adams, was not home and gave the officers consent to enter the house and look for Adams.

Adams jumped through a window with a gun and ran away from the deputies, who gave chase, the sheriff's office said. During the foot chase, Adams fell, dropped the gun, immediately picked the gun back up and pointed it back at the deputies, according to the sheriff's office. The deputies ordered Adams to drop the gun. Adams refused to drop the gun, and a deputy shot the man.

Deputies performed first aid until an ambulance arrived, but Adams was later pronounced dead at Medical City Denton.

The car in the driveway of the house Adams was staying at was confirmed stolen from the city of Denton, and the Denton Police Department is helping out with the investigation.

Adams' outstanding warrants in Florida were for probation violations stemming from charges of dangerous drugs, possession of a controlled substance and battery of a police officer.

The investigation is still ongoing.
