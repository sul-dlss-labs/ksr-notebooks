A 55-year-old woman killed last week when her SUV was struck by a BMW pursued in a police chase, had spent the previous year caring for her traumatically injured husband.

Laura Lee Price of Inverness died at the scene of the accident Tuesday afternoon on State Road 44 in Wildwood.

Less than a year ago, Price’s husband suffered a traumatic injury that had left him in a coma for some time. She had to leave her job in order to support her husband’s rehabilitation.

She was also the mother of three children.

She had no life insurance.

“She was the foundation of their household in all aspects, making sure her family was supported and taken care of. The family unfortunately has no life insurance and can’t even bear to think about finances at a time like this,” a friend wrote on a GoFundMe page set up to raise money for the family.

The man who had been driving the BMW, 27-year-old Anthony Nepoleon Brown of Ocala, continues to be held without bond at the Sumter County Detention Center. He is a convicted felon who had an AK-47 in the vehicle.

In addition to a weapons charge, Brown has been charged with leaving the scene of a crash involving a death, providing false information regarding a fatal traffic crash, felony murder, driving while license revoked, as well as fleeing and eluding.
