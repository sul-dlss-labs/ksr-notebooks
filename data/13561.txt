RICHLAND COUNTY, SC (WIS) - One man is dead and another has been hospitalized after deputies spotted the two trying to break in to a Columbia business early Friday morning.

A Richland County Sheriff's Department spokesperson said deputies patrolling the Two Notch Road area saw the two suspects attempting to break in to Columbia Powersports around 3:30 a.m.

As deputies exited their vehicles in an attempt to question the men, one of the suspects got into a truck and, as he tried to drive off, ran over his accomplice.

At that point, according to Capt. Chris Cowan, the man drove toward deputies and hit a patrol vehicle. The officers opened fire on the truck.

"The officers discharged their firearms there at Columbia Powersports several times striking the vehicle and striking him," said Cowan.



The suspect, who has been identified as Eddie Hollins, 33, was hit by gunfire, managed to drive a short distance away before crashing into the side of a sports bar near Columbia Place Mall, investigators said. He was pronounced dead at the scene from complications due to his injuries, the coroner's office said.



The other suspect, identified as James Branch, is listed in critical condition in an area hospital.

The South Carolina Law Enforcement Division is investigating.
