Although the Indiana State Police did not recover a weapon from CrealÂs pocket, they did recover crack-cocaine in that pocket.The investigation of the Indiana State Police was turned over to the Grand Jury during MondayÂs session and upon the conclusion of the Grand JuryÂs deliberations, the Grand Jury reported to Elkhart Circuit Court Judge Terry C. Shewmaker that no criminal chargers were warranted.ÂOn August 6th, the Elkhart Police Department acted properly in pursuing drug dealers within the City of Elkhart. They secured a valid search warrant based upon intelligence of illegal drug activity at the 230 West Jackson Boulevard, Apt. C location and organized the execution of the search warrant in a manner that is designed for the safety of the officers as well as any possible occupants of the location. The officers did their job and Stanley Creal made a fatal error in failing to heed police warnings by taking an action that was perceived to be a threat to the safety of police officers. His error proved fatalÂ, said Prosecuting Attorney Curtis T. Hill, Jr.
