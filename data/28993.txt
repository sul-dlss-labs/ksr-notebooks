Escambia County Sheriffâ€™s Office deputies were involved in a fatal officer-involved shooting Tuesday near Perdido Key while responding to a suicide threat.

ECSO spokesman Maj. Andrew Hobbs told the News Journal that a man died after he opened fire on deputies and the deputies returned fire.

No deputies were injured in the exchange, and authorities had yet to release the name of the deceased man as of 4:15 p.m. Tuesday.

According to an ECSO announcement made about the shooting via social media, deputies were dispatched about 12:20 p.m. Tuesday to the 1400 block of Canal Way in response to a reported suicide threat.

When they arrived, deputies found a man who was threatening suicide and was on the beach near the 1300 block of Sandy Key Drive.

Deputies approached the man and saw that he was armed, according to the ECSO.

"Deputies attempted to talk to the male, at which time he opened fire on the deputies who returned fire striking the male," according to the ECSO social media post.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement responded to the scene to investigate the officer-involved shooting, per normal protocol.
