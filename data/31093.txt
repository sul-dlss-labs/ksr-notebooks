A man who was shot by Madison County sheriff's deputies has died.The shooting took place Saturday morning off of Yandel Road and Highway 51.Madison County Sheriff Randy Tucker said the incident started with a call about a domestic dispute between a husband and wife. The sheriff said the husband, later identified as Calvin Robinson, 52, took off in a car and after a short pursuit, he stopped and appeared to have a weapon."(He) brandished a firearm and pointed it at officers, and it became an officer-involved (shooting) at that point, and the suspect was ultimately shot and injured. (He was) shot in the leg, transported to UMMC by paramedics after receiving medical attention on-site," Tucker said.Robinson died Saturday of a gunshot wound, Madison County Coroner Alex Breeland said."Here, in a very quiet strip mall area, we just don’t see that here very often or we don’t see that here at all. That just goes to show you crime has no boundaries. It can happen anywhere at any time," Tucker said.
