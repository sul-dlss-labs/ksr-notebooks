Baldwin County Sheriff Huey Mack reports that a Silverhill man committed suicide during a standoff with deputies.

Mack says the standoff began around 10:20 a.m. when a sheriff's deputy was called to the come on a welfare concern.

According to Mack the man, who was inside his trailer on the 1300 block of Woodpecker Road, had been involved in a recent ongoing dispute with family members.

A relative contacted sheriff's deputies after not being able to contact the man. The relative informed deputies that the man had weapons inside his home.

When a sheriff's deputy came to the home, he was able to contact the man via phone and tried to lure the man out of the home. The attempt to get the man out of the home and away from his weapons proved unsuccessful. The man inside the home threatened to hurt himself before breaking contact with the deputy, Mack says.

The deputy called for backup and a standoff ensued. Around 20 officers responded to the scene.

"We made over a dozen attempts to negotiate with the man," Mack says.

Just after 2:40 p.m., deputies tear-gassed the mobile home in a final effort to draw the man out of the home.

When officers observed no response, a SWAT team entered the home and discovered the man was deceased, having suffered a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Mack was not able to release the identity of the man, but described him as a white male in his late 30s.

The investigation of the incident is ongoing, Mack says.
