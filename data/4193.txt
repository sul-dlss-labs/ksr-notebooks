RALEIGH, N.C. â€” Authorities are conducting an investigation into the death of a suspect who died during an arrest attempt in Raleigh.

Shortly before 10 p.m. Wednesday, officers went to 3021 Taybran Lane to serve an arrest warrant for 21-year-old Batrane Jermal Hedgepeth. He was in violation for failing to show up for an April 28 court appearance for a Dec. 11 charge of public consumption of alcohol.

During the arrest process, a struggle ensued, and additional officers responded to the scene. Before the arrest could be completed, Hedgepath appeared to develop medical problems.

Hedgepeth was transported to WakeMed, where he was later pronounced dead. According to court records, he had a prior criminal record, including several cocaine-related charges and probation violations.

The State Bureau of Investigation will conduct an investigation into the incident. The results of the SBI investigation will be forwarded to Wake County District Attorney Colon Willoughby for review.

The Raleigh Police Department's Internal Affairs Unit will also conduct an administrative investigation.

In 2004, another man died in Raleigh police's custody after a brief struggle. A medical examiner determined that Derek Haithcock had a high level of cocaine in his system. Officers tried to arrest Haithcock after he stole a bottle of liquor from the ABC Store in Mission Valley.
