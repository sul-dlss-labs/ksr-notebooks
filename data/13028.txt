MARINETTE CO. (WITI) -- Marinette County Sheriff's officials are investigating two shooting incidents that occurred Monday night, July 1st in the Town of Pound. One of the shootings was officer-involved.



According to officials, the Sheriff's Office received a call from a man who said he had found a suspicious person at his family cabin off of North 5th in the Town of Pound at 10:09 p.m. The caller told police the suspicious person was armed.



Shortly after the call, officials received a second call regarding a vehicle that crashed into a residence in the same area.



When officials arrived the scene, they were able to remove an injured man from the vehicle. Police say the victim, a man in his late 20's, suffered from a gunshot wound. The man was taken to Bay Area Medical Center and then transferred to a Green Bay Hospital, where he later died.



The investigation led officers to another location in the same area. When officials arrived on the scene, they located a man in a vehicle armed with a shotgun and handgun. The male suspect, who is believed to be in his late 70's, refused multiple commands from officers to surrender.



At one point, police say the suspect put officers in jeopardy by pointing a weapon in their direction. At that time, officers fired their weapons, and the male suspect was shot and killed at the scene.



No officers were injured as a result of the incident.



No additional details have been released at this time -- including the identity of the man found shot after crashing his vehicle, or the armed man who was killed during the officer-involved shooting.



At this time, the specific circumstances surrounding each incident is unclear. It is also unclear if the incidents are connected.



The investigation is ongoing.
