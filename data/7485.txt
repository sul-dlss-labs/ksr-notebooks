KIMBALL — A Kimball County grand jury has found no wrongdoing by police in a September shooting that left one man dead.

The grand jury found that officers acted properly in the Sept. 14 shooting death of 29-year-old Branden Overlin.

Authorities say Overlin was shot in a confrontation with police at his sister’s home. His sister had called police after Overlin allegedly wrecked her vehicle.

Under Nebraska law, a grand jury is called when a suspect dies in police custody or while being apprehended.
