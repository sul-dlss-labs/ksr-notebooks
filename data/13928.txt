A 40-year-old man shot by San Diego police after a pursuit on Thursday was identified by authorities as Jose Luis Navarro of Lemon Grove.

He had remained on life support, but died Saturday afternoon, police homicde Lt. Mike Hastings said.

Four officers fired about 20 rounds at Navarro at the end of an hourlong chase Thursday morning in the Mount Hope neighborhood, after police said he raised a pistol while sitting in his car.

Authorities said the driver was a suspect in a shooting that wounded two men in the Mountain View neighborhood days earlier.

Sheriff’s records show two warrants were issued in September for Navarro’s arrest, one for possessing methamphetamine for sale and the other for transporting drugs.

The incident began with a routine traffic stop, when an officer tried to pull over Navarro for talking on a cellphone, said San Diego police homicide Lt. Mike Hastings. But the driver refused to stop, leading officers through southeastern San Diego, Bonita and National City.

He dropped off a female passenger at one point, then continued to flee.

Officers used spike strips to deflate his tires, and his Saturn came to a stop. Police said he raised a gun, prompting the officers to open fire. An impact weapon, such as a bean bag shotgun, was also deployed, Hastings said.

A gun was found in the car, along with what is believed to be methamphetamine, the lieutenant said.

The woman, whose name has not been released, was later jailed on drug charges, police said.
