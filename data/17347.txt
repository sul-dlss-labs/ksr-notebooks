A report just released on a deadly shooting involving Rapid City police states that lethal force was necessary.

The summary on the Feb. 28 shooting of Earl W. Hicks near the Cornerstone Rescue mission was released Monday by the South Dakota Attorney General’s office.

Rapid City Police Officer Barry Young shot and killed Hicks after Hicks shot another man.

The shooting victim, Jim Rourke, told police that Hicks walked up to him and a friend, pulled a gun and started screaming at them … that he was going to kill them.

Rourke then reportedly lunged at Hicks to grab the gun. That’s when he was shot.

Witnesses told investigators Hicks then chased the other man around the parking lot, shooting at him.

Officer Young told investigators that when he was called to the mission on a report of an active shooter, he saw Hicks, with a gun in his hand, walking toward the shooting victim.

Young said when he yelled at Hicks to drop the gun, Hicks turned toward him and began to raise the gun. That’s when the officer fired three shots from his service rifle, hitting Hicks once.

The investigation showed that Hicks had just, two days earlier, bought the 9 mm handgun used in the shooting.

While Hicks had no criminal history, police did have several encounters with him. It was learned that Hicks had a history of depression. A drug screen and alcohol test on Hicks was negative.

Young has been in law enforcement since 2003, first as a Pennington County Sheriff's deputy and then with the RCPD. He is back on duty.
