Richard Tyson, 20, a young black man, was shot multiple times by an Inglewood police officer at 906 Victor Ave. in Inglewood and died at 1:24 p.m. Wednesday, May 9.

According to Inglewood police, Tyson was on a bicycle, and an officer from the department's anti-crime team had tried to stop him for a municipal code violation. Tyson ran. Officers followed. One was searching for him in a back yard and found him hiding in "dense bushes."

The officer told him to surrender, and he "advanced toward" the officer. At some point, the man reached for his waistband, and the officer, thinking he was reaching for a gun, shot him. Tyson's foster family contacted The Homicide Report and sent the photo shown here.
