A 20-year-old man was discovered dead in his Molalla home Tuesday, hours after Clackamas County deputies heard a gunshot from inside while serving a warrant for his arrest.

Deputies went to the home in the 30500 block of South Deardorff Road around 12:40 p.m. to serve the misdemeanor and check on the man's welfare, according to Sgt. Brian Jensen, a county sheriff's spokesman.

The SWAT team was called after the gunshot was heard. Authorities went into the home around 5:45 p.m. and found the man with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Jensen said.

The delay was because investigators believed he was alive after the gunshot and had barricaded himself inside.

No one else was injured. The man's identity hasn't yet been identified by the sheriff's office. Jensen said he didn't know what the arrest warrant alleged.
