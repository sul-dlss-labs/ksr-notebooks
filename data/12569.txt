March 30, 2013 : Submitted by Sgt. Peter Lopez, Investigative Division, Delano Police Department A Delano police officer remains on administrative leave after he shot and killed a man stabbing a woman during an early morning domestic violence call Saturday.

Investigators said officers responded to an assault in progress in the 600 block of 7th Avenue in Delano about 5:06 a.m. When officers arrived, a man was stabbing a woman victim inside the home. The officers ordered him to stop, but he continued the assault. An officer then shot the man.

Emergency medical personnel responded to the scene, and pronounced Taurino Martinez Guevara, 46, dead from his gunshot injuries.

The 27-year-old woman suffered stab wounds to her face and head area from the attack, and a single gunshot wound to her knee fired by police.

She was taken to Kern Medical Center in Bakersfield by ambulance where she is listed in stable condition.

Because the case involves domestic violence and is currently investigated as an attempted homicide by the Delano Police Investigation Unit, the victim’s identity remains confidential.

Guevara’s name was released late Saturday afternoon after his family was notified by the Kern County Sheriff Coroner’s office.

The police officer who fired his weapon was placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the officer-involved shooting investigation conducted by the Kern County District Attorney’s Office and the administrative investigation conducted by the Delano Police Department.
