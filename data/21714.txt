Authorities say a man took his own life following a chase and standoff early Thursday morning.

According to the Midland County Sheriff's Office, 36-year-old John Self died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The sheriff's office states that their deputies were called to a report of a disturbance in the 1000 block of West County Road 137 off of State Highway 349 around 2:21 a.m.

When the deputies arrived they saw the Self's vehicle leaving and a short chase began.

The chase ended when the Self's vehicle was found in the 600 block of South Dallas and Self reportedly barricaded himself inside of a home.

The sheriff's office and Midland Police Department's SWAT team were then called to the scene along with negotiators who tried to talk Self into cooperating.

Eventually authorities used gas inside of the home to try and get Self to come out. When the SWAT team entered the house they found that he had died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

No other details have been released on the case at this time.
