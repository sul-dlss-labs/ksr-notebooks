From Times Wire Reports

A 31-year-old Santa Rosa man who died after a struggle with police was shot six times with Taser stun guns and briefly knocked unconscious with a neck restraint, police said.

In releasing more details about the weekend incident, police said Monday that Carlos Casillas Fernandez was probably under the influence of drugs and that it took five officers to restrain him.

While trying to subdue Fernandez, one of the officers applied a direct Taser jolt to Fernandezâ€™s shoulder, said Lt. Ernest Olivares. Also, one of the officers used a carotid restraint on Fernandez, a maneuver that causes unconsciousness by blocking the flow of blood to the brain through the carotid arteries.
