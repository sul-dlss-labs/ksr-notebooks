A man with a mental disorder who died after fighting with police was at some point unable to breathe and suffered irreversible brain damage, an autopsy revealed.

Police and relatives of Nazario J. Solorio, 38, said he lapsed into a coma after a May 28 altercation in which an officer used a Taser gun on him at Solorio’s mother’s home while police were trying to get him to a hospital.

He died a week later at a local hospital.

“It was the way the body was positioned and the physiological changes going on,” Jessica Boyer, an investigator with the San Diego County medical examiner’s office, said Thursday. “The Taser really had nothing to do with his death.”
