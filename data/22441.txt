WEST MILFORD, W.Va. — A 21-year-old Ohio man has been identified as the suspect killed in a shootout with police Sunday.

Brian Ziro, of Columbus, Ohio, was fatally wounded after shooting at Harrison County Sheriff’s deputies, following an armed carjacking in Columbus that launched a multi-state pursuit of the stolen vehicle and suspects.

Harrison County Sheriff Robert Matheny has said the incident began early Sunday morning, when the suspects carjacked a vehicle in the Columbus, Ohio area and headed east toward West Virginia. Law enforcement patrolled the interstates in search of the stolen vehicle.

Harrison County Sheriff’s deputies spotted the vehicle on Interstate 79 and attempted a traffic stop. Suspects continued to flee and started a pursuit, exiting the interstate at exit 110 at Lost Creek. After several miles, the driver of the carjacked vehicle spun around and drive straight the toward the deputies and fired multiple shots. Deputies did not return fire at that point.

The vehicle reached a dead end, and the suspects then exited the vehicle.

Ziro was caught about 30 minutes later, when deputies encountered him on a bridge in West Milford and attempted to arrest him. Ziro pulled a weapon on the deputies, and at that time, they did return fire.

Ziro was then transported to United Hospital Center in Bridgeport, where he was later pronounced dead.

No deputies were injured.

Sgt. M.A. Kiddy of West Virginia State Police is investigating the officer-involved shooting.

Three other suspects were arrested without incident after a 10-hour manhunt — JaBraelyn Bunn, 20, of Canton, Ohio, Jacob Hunter, 18, of Massillon, Ohio, and Jada Hilton, 18, of Canton, Ohio.
