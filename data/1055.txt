Pool-agent spill jams traffic

About 50 pounds of a powdery swimming pool agent spilled at the intersection of Auiki Street and Sand Island Access Road yesterday afternoon, forcing police to close roads leading to the area and creating a major traffic jam.

The chlorine/bromine powder spilled from a flatbed truck belonging to All Pool & Spa at about 2:35 p.m., said fire spokesman Capt. Richard Soo. Cars driving behind the truck spread the particles until the spill covered about a 100-yard area, Soo said.

Firefighters swept up the mess, hosed down the area and then tested the water to make sure it wasn't at toxic levels, Soo said. He said there were no reports of injuries and the area was not evacuated during the cleanup.
