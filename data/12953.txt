NORTHWEST MIAMI-DADE (CBSMiami) - Miami-Dade police are investigating a deadly shooting involving two of their officers.

A 38-year-old man was shot and killed by two officers at a home at 3201 NW 68th Street in Northwest Miami-Dade.

Police arrived at the house at 8:45 AM in response to a call about a domestic dispute.

"A 9-1-1 call was received about a domestic dispute at which time the caller advised that the subject had an open arrest warrant out of the city of Miami," said Lt. John Jenkins, with the Miami-Dade Police Department.

Miami-Dade police said the man involved was also wanted for a strong armed robbery. When officers tried to take him into custody, the man reportedly started to fight back.

"Officers attempted to make contact with the subject, a violent struggle ensued with the subject over the officers gun at which time the subject was struck," said Lt. Jenkins.

Two female officers fired their guns, killing the man. It is unclear if he was armed or not. Both officers suffered minor injuries during the struggle and were treated on the scene. The names of the officers and victim have not been released yet as the investigation continues.
