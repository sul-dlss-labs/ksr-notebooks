OIL SPRINGS, Ky. (AP) -- A Kentucky State Police trooper fatally shot a man arrested on an intoxication charge after the suspect threatened him with a weapon that went undetected during a search.

Randy Baldwin, who was armed with a handgun, was shot once Tuesday evening during a struggle with Trooper Byron Hansford, state police said. Baldwin, 46, of Oil Springs in eastern Kentucky, was airlifted to Cabell Huntington Hospital in West Virginia, where he underwent surgery before dying early Wednesday, police said.

Hansford, a 17-year state police veteran assigned to the Pikeville post, was placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated. An autopsy was planned on Baldwin's body.

Hansford arrested Baldwin on an alcohol intoxication charge after responding to a call of a suspicious person at an intersection in Johnson County, police said.

The trooper, who was alone, searched Baldwin and placed him in his cruiser to take him to jail.

"After traveling down the road a short way, Baldwin advised the trooper that he had a weapon and threatened to kill the trooper if he didn't pull off and let him out," said state police Trooper Scott Hopkins, a spokesman for the Pikeville post.

When Hansford opened a car door, Baldwin approached the trooper with a loaded hand gun, Hopkins said.

A struggle broke out as Hansford tried to disarm Baldwin, Hopkins said. Hansford later fired once, striking Baldwin in the torso, he said.

Hopkins was unsure why the handgun wasn't found during Hansford's search of Baldwin.

"He was wearing heavy clothing, a jacket," he said.
