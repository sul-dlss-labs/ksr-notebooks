A 20-year-old man and his 16-year-old fiancee were killed in a fiery car crash after he abducted her from her home at gunpoint during a Thanksgiving dinner.

Elijah Cox and Raina Reed were killed instantly when his speeding car crashed into a tree and burst into flames in Villa Rica, Georgia at about 8.40pm on Thursday night.

The couple had been living at his parent's house in the days leading up to the accident but the teenager's family were not happy with the arrangements and took her back to their home.

Carroll County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Brad Robinson said Cox went to Reed's family home on Thursday armed with a shotgun.

The teenager and her five family members were forced to hide in the bathroom and call 911.

'He came in yelling for Raina and kicked in the bathroom door and she jumped up as brave as she is and slapped him in the face and told him to stop,' her aunt told WSBTV.

Cox's dark-colored Volvo sedan crossed over onto the opposite side of the road, before crashing into a tree and bursting into flames

'He grabbed her, and she was telling him to stop, that she didn't want to go.'

Cox took the teenager and fled in his dark-colored Volvo sedan.

Robinson said authorities passed Cox on their way to the home and he was speeding in the opposite direction.

His car crossed over onto the opposite side of the road, before crashing into a tree and bursting into flames.
