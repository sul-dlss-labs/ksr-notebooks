Body in Mississippi identified as Davenport man

Authorities in eastern Iowa have identified the body found Saturday in the Mississippi River. A boater saw it floating south of the I-280 bridge, grabbed it and phoned for help. Bettendorf police say an autopsy was performed Monday in Belvidere, Illinois, and the body has been identified as that of 32-year-old Matt Haessler of Davenport. Fingerprints were used to make the ID.

Haessler either fell or jumped from the I-74 bridge earlier this month while running from Bettendorf cops. They had stopped the stolen car he was driving on the bridge. Police say they are waiting for a toxicology report to determine the cause of death. Until then, the investigation remains open.
