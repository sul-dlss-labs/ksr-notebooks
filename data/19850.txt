A 72-year-old man was killed Monday afternoon after his vehicle was hit by two women fleeing police in Detroit, officials said.

The crash occurred around 3:30 p.m. at Woodward and State Fair.

Police officers spotted a Dodge Intrepid driven by a 51-year-old woman heading the wrong way on East Hollywood, said Detroit Police Officer Jennifer Moreno. Also in the vehicle was a 32-year-old female passenger.

When police attempted to pull the vehicle over the driver of the Intrepid sped away and hit a red Ford Ranger, driven by a 72-year-old man.

All of those involved in the crash were taken to the hospital where the man was pronounced dead. Conditions werenâ€™t immediately available for the two women.

Moreno said she could not confirm if the attempted traffic stop was related to a human trafficking investigation, but noted that the area the women were fleeing is known for high drug activity.

Parts of Woodward were shut after the accident, but the road has been reopened to traffic, according to police.
