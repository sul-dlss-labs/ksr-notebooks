-- Tuscaloosa County Sheriff Ted Sexton said Saturday a suspect in an armed robbery in Holt was killed after he shot a deputy in the leg Friday afternoon.

The man who police say robbed the Sumner Super Market at 4104 Alabama Avenue NE was identified by Sexton as Barry Mullenix.

Sexton said the deputy was responding to the armed robbery call when he stopped a truck that he knew left Mullenix's residence at Crescent Ridge Road and Alabama Avenue.

Mullenix stepped out of of the truck and shot the deputy, who returned fire and killed Mullenix, Sexton said.

The injured deputy, whose name has not been released, received treatment for his wound to his thigh at DCH Regional Medical Center and is recovering, Sexton said.

"After a review of information, witness statements, and deputies at the scene, it is my opinion at this time that this Deputy Involved Shooting was within policy of the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office and that this deputy found himself with no other alternative but to respond to the actions of Mullenix with deadly force," Sexton said.

The Alabama Bureau of Investigations will conduct an investigation into the shooting with the assistance of the Tuscaloosa Metro Homicide Unit and the Tuscaloosa County District Attorney's office. The findings will be presented to the Tuscaloosa County Grand Jury.
