A Brockton Police Officer shot and killed a man early Thursday morning after they say the man pointed what looked like a gun at them.

A woman ran into the Brockton Police Headquarters at about 12:30 a.m. saying that Douglas Buckley, 45, of Brockton threatened to burn her Thayer Street house down. She told the police that Buckley had been drinking and barking out other threats to her and the other people in the home.

Officers pulled up to the scene and found Buckley outside the home with a police scanner in one hand and a rifle in the other. He dropped the rifle when police arrived, but pulled a concealed handgun from his back and pointed it at officers.

Both officers opened fire, one bullet struck Buckley in the lower right abdomen. According to the information supplied by the Plymouth County District Attorney Tim Cruz’s office, the police called in the EMS and Buckley was taken to Signature Healthcare in Brockton where he was pronounced dead at about 2:05 a.m..

The preliminary investigation revealed that the two weapons Buckley had were BB guns that looked like real guns.

State Police Detectives assigned to the Plymouth County District Attorney’s Office with assistance from the State Police Collision Analysis Reconstruction Section, Crime Scene Service Section, Firearm Identification Section and Crime Lab personnel are investigating the shooting.
