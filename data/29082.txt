JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A man who was shot multiple times by Jacksonville police officers Wednesday night has died.

According to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office, officers and detectives were parked in the area of East 63rd Street waiting for another group of detectives to join them while they conducted an investigation for a gang in the area.

Around 10 p.m., police said a man carrying a large, semi-automatic rifle walked up toward the front of the vehicle.

“He, at some point, for whatever reason, struck the front of the vehicle with the butt of that rifle, and then he pointed it at our officers”, Chief TK Waters of JSO said.

Officers exited the vehicle and fired several shots. Chief Waters said officers conducted aid until rescue units arrived and transported the man to the hospital where he died.

Police identified the man as Justin Reed, 34.

The officers who fired at the man were identified as G.A. Taylor and M.L Mullis. This is the first officer-involved shooting for both officers.

The State Attorney’s Office responded to the scene to conduct an investigation.
