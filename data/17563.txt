GREENBELT, Md. (WUSA9) -- A 28-year-old Greenbelt man is dead after a standoff involving police officers late Monday night, Greenbelt police said.

Officers responded to a report of a man shooting a gun in the area of the 6200 block of Springhill Court just after 10:30 p.m. When they got to the scene, they found the man firing from the third-floor balcony of an apartment.

Police later identified the man as Rico Don Rae Johnson of Greenbelt.

"It was horrible!" Daniella Enow said she, her husband and three young children had to duck for cover when they heard gunshots echoing throughout the courtyard.

A witness tells WUSA9 he spotted Johnson speeding home and then heard a gunshot coming from the car. The witness also said Johnson was yelling to himself before he got to the apartment.

Authorities say that is when Johnson started firing at officers.

Shantel Abraham lives in the building and ran into the closet with her six- and four-year-old children.

"They were crying and I was trying to calm them down," she recalled.

The incident lasted about an hour, police say. Johnson was then shot by a Greenbelt officer.

Officers were able to get into the apartment and take Johnson into custody. A shotgun and a handgun were found inside of the apartment. It is not certain if he was using both of the weapons at the same time.

Johnson was taken to the Prince George's General Hospital, where he later died.

Nobody else was injured in the incident. The investigation is ongoing, police said.

Neighbors say Johnson had only been living in the apartment for three months and police had already been called for a domestic dispute with his girlfriend.
