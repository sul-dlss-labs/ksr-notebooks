Authorities say she lured a 50-year-old man to the back of a grocery store in Oakland County's White Lake Township. There, she and 33-year-old Bryan Doyle, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and wearing a ski mask, stole the man's money and car keys, authorities say.

She was arraigned Saturday in the White Lake Township robbery and was expected to be arraigned Monday in the other holdups and attempted holdups in Pontiac, Auburn Hills and Waterford Township.

Investigators say they believe Dando was the getaway driver in all five Oakland County crimes.

Police spotted the truck believed used after the robberies as it stopped at Doyle's home in Waterford Township on Friday. Dando ran, but police caught her. Police say Doyle pointed the shotgun at a Waterford Township officer, who shot and killed him.
