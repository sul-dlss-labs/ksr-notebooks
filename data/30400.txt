Authorities have released the name of a man killed in an officer-involved shooting in Walker County.

Coroner Joey Vick on Friday identified the slain man as Gregory Hambric. He was 64.

Few details have been released in the incident. Sheriffâ€™s officials said deputies responded about 8:30 p.m. Thursday to a report of an active shooter at a residence in the Boldo community.

A woman told 911 that there had been an argument and one family member was firing on another family.

When deputies arrived, authorities said Hambric was still belligerent. He refused orders to comply and was shot.

The Alabama Law Enforcement Agency is leading the probe.
