A rash of highway crashes yesterday and Friday in Virginia claimed eight lives, including two men killed in wrecks while being chased by police in Bedford and Richmond counties.

In Bedford County, Justin Ryan Smith, 20, was killed yesterday about 12:45 a.m. when he lost control of a sport utility vehicle and crashed while being pursued by a Bedford County sheriff's deputy, according to state police.

The reason for the pursuit was not available last night from Bedford authorities.

Smith lost control of the SUV at state Routes 704 and 643 and overturned, police said. He was not wearing a seat belt and was thrown from the vehicle, police said.

The Richmond County crash occurred Friday about 10:30 p.m., when Clifton W. Jackson, 57, of Warsaw lost control of a minivan and wrecked while being chased by a Warsaw police officer, police said.

Warsaw Police Chief Dewitt Cooper said yesterday that the chase began when the officer saw Jackson driving without his headlights on.

State police, who investigated the crash, said Jackson ran off U.S. 360, a mile east of state Route 661, and overturned.

Jackson, who like Smith was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from his vehicle, police said.

One of the eight victims was an unidentified man killed early yesterday by a hit-and-run driver in Richmond.

The man was hit about 2 a.m. by what might have been a red Ford Contour in the 3300 block of Broad Rock Boulevard. The car's driver fled, police said.

The car may have damage in the area of the right headlight, police said.

Anyone with information about the hit-and-run is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (804) 780-1000.

Meanwhile, state police reported the deaths yesterday and Friday of five other victims, bringing Virginia's 2007 highway death toll yesterday to 530, compared to 491 as of the same day last year:
