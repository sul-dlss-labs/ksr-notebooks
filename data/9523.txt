Reginald Linthicum, a 43-year-old black man, was shot and killed by Inglewood police Monday, Oct. 4, in the 1300 block of West 6th Street in San Pedro, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Linthicum was suspected of robbing a flower shop and a Radio Shack store on Monday morning. He was shot about 9:30 a.m. near a San Pedro hospital parking lot after abandoning his car and attempting to carjack a motorist, said Inglewood Police Lt. B. Mylar.

Inglewood police began chasing him after responding to the robbery call at a flower store at Manchester Avenue and 11th Street, where shots were reportedly fired and a man told officers he was wounded.

While there, officers got a report that a man fitting the description of the robber had robbed the Radio Shack at Manchester and Hillcrest Boulevard.

Mylar said a suspect fitting the description was seen at La Cienega Boulevard and Manchester Avenue moments later and the pursuit ensued, from the southbound 405 Freeway to the 110 Freeway and then on surface streets in San Pedro.

The chase concluded at Providence Little Company of Mary Medical Center, where Linthicum abandoned his vehicle and made an effort to carjack another.

Mylar said the officer-involved shooting occurred at that point. He said Linthicum was taken to Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, where he died.
