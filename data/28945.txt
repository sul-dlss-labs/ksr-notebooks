MCNAIRY COUNTY, Tenn. — The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation had agents responding to a fatal officer-involved shooting in McNairy County, on Monday

The agency said the incident started at approximately 1:14 a.m. on U.S. Highway 45 in Chester County. Officers from the Henderson Police Department attempted to conduct a traffic stop after receiving a call from a concerned citizen regarding a possible impaired driver.

Authorities later determined the vehicle in question was driven by Anthony Jones. TBI said after officers initiated emergency equipment, Jones led officers on an extended pursuit and, at times, reached speeds exceeding 100 miles an hour.

TBI said Jones eventually wrecked the vehicle in the 5700 block of Highway 45 in Bethel Springs in McNairy County. He then exited the vehicle and portrayed, with actions and statements, to have a firearm.

TBI said then two Henderson officers gave verbal commands to Jones, which he disregarded. Officers attempted to subdue Jones with a electroshock weapon, which proved to be ineffective. The situation escalated further, resulting in one of the officers firing two shots from a service weapon, striking Jones.

Police Chief Gary Davidson identified the officers involved as Officer Kyle Carter and Officer Danielle Cook on Tuesday.

TBI said lifesaving efforts were attempted at the scene by officers and EMS, Jones later died at a hospital in Corinth, Mississippi. A firearm was not recovered at the scene and it was later determined that the vehicle Jones was driving had been reported stolen in Jackson immediately prior to this morning’s events.
