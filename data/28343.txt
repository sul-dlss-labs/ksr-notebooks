The McCracken County Sheriff’s Office on Monday released new details in the deputy-involved shooting last week. McCracken County Sheriff Matt Carter said the former McCracken County High School volunteer fishing coach pointed a fully loaded handgun at the deputy.

Carter said former fishing coach John Parks pointed a fully loaded handgun at Detective Dustin Awbery in front of a residence on Court Avenue in Paducah on June 29. Awbery in response fired two shots, both hitting Parks. Kentucky State Police in a separate release Sunday said an autopsy showed Parks died from those shots.

Parks pleaded guilty to attempted sex abuse and child pornography charges in February. Carter in past statements said Awbery, along with other unnamed law enforcement, pursued Parks after Parks tried to obtain false identification documents and flee the area before his sentencing. Chief Deputy Ryan Norman said a prosecutor decided to revoke Park’s conditional $5,000 bond after detectives discovered Parks was trying to flee the area.

“I have and will remain steadfast to be as transparent with every detail that surrounds this incident, however additional details will and can only be released once the Kentucky State Police complete their investigation,” said Carter in his statement. “I look forward to the day the investigation is completed and every detail can be released.”

Carter also said law enforcement found two other loaded magazines on Parks after he was shot. Chief Deputy Ryan Norman said Awbery is on paid administrative leave. Kentucky State Police is continuing the investigation into the shooting.
