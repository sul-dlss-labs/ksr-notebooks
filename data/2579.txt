Ten days after the police stormed into his home without warning, a Brooklyn man with a history of heart trouble died yesterday, and a lawyer for his family charged that his death had been caused by officers who had broken in with drawn guns, slapped a child, ransacked the house and ignored pleas for explanations.

The police yesterday acknowledged that officers had gone in without warning or a warrant, but said they had done so justifiably in pursuit of a suspect they thought was armed. The suspect, who they said may have been a son of the dead man, apparently escaped through a rear window, the police said.

Hours after the man, Calvin Washington, 41, died at New York Weill Cornell Center in Manhattan, the lawyer, Eric G. Poulos, attributed his death to the aftereffects of an ''out-of-control, unsupervised'' invasion of Mr. Washington's home at 247 Vernon Avenue, in Bedford Stuyvesant, by the officers on June 18.

Mr. Poulos said the family would file a wrongful-death suit accusing the police of negligence, false imprisonment, assaulting family members and failing to render medical aid to Mr. Washington, who wore a pacemaker and, the lawyer said, suffered a heart attack during the incident.
