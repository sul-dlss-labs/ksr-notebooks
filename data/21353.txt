NORTON SHORES, MI â€“ Authorities have released the name of the 21-year-old Ottawa County man who shot himself inside a stolen pickup truck at the Pontaluna Road exit on U.S. 31 on Aug. 28.

They identified the man as Douglas Norton, who was from the Grand Haven area. Norton was driving the truck with a 15-year-old female passenger, who authorities described as a runaway, when the incident occurred Tuesday afternoon

Grand Haven police spotted the stolen vehicle and the missing teen around 2:31 p.m., police said, and followed the truck into Muskegon County, where authorities attempted to make a traffic stop before Norton committed suicide.

In addition to the stolen pickup truck, the girl's mother also reported the theft of one .22-caliber rifle and a .45-caliber handgun and some jewelry from her home, said Lt. Mark Bennett from the Ottawa County Sheriff's Department.

When the authorities arrived to the scene, one of the guns and some of the jewelry was missing, Bennett said, but the gun was later recovered. Some of the jewelry is still unaccounted for, he said.

Bennett said he could not say which gun Norton used to kill himself.

Bennett said it was unclear what motivated Norton to pull the trigger, but noted that he had legal issues in the past. He also said that Norton had been put on probation recently; law enforcement records show he was sentenced to probation earlier this month on larceny and home invasion charges.

The teenager was released to her family after questioning, Bennett said. He said the case will be sent to the Ottawa County Prosecutor's Office for review, but it is unlikely the 15-year-old will face charges.
