Gray,LA. (AP) - Authorities say a state trooper shot and killed a 22-year-old man who fled after slamming his pickup truck into a mobile home and later tried to grab the officer's gun. Clarence Jones of Gray died Sunday from a shot to the abdomen. The trooper's name will not be released until an investigation is complete. State police say the officer will remain on duty. Investigators say Jones lost control of a borrowed pickup and crashed into the occupied trailer. A woman and four children inside escaped serious injury. After the crash, investigators say Jones ran off, but was tracked down a short time later by troopers and Terrebonne parish sheriff's deputies. Sheriff Jerry Larpenter says several troopers grabbed jones as he tried to scale a fence. Larpenter says the trooper felt Jones was attempting to disarm him, and he fired one shot that struck Jones on the right side in the abdomen. Jones was later pronounced dead at a Thibodaux hospital.
