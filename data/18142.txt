AURORA, Mo.– The man who was shot after he drove towards an Aurora police officer following a pursuit stretching through two counties has died.

38-year-old Thomas E. Sekscinski, of Aurora, succumbed to his injuries Wednesday that he sustained from the shooting on Wednesday, August 31.

Last Wednesday, an Aurora police officer attempted to stop Sekscinski for driving a stolen SUV just shortly after 2 a.m. in Aurora.

Sekscinski took off leading the officer down County Road 1165 near McDowell in Barry County. That’s when things took a dangerous turn.

“The subject turned down a private lane at which time the officer stopped and exited his vehicle. The subject then turned around and was driving back towards the officer when he discharged his weapon at the subject,” said Sgt. John H. Lueckenhoff, Missouri State Highway Patrol Public Information and Education Officer.

Lueckenhoff said although he does not know what the suspect’s intent was, the officer feared for his life because he was no longer in the safety of his vehicle. Both the officer and Sekscinski were by themselves.

The investigation is ongoing by the Missouri State Highway Patrol Division of Drug and Crime Control.
