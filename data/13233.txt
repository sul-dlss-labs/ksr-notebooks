Two days before the world knew who George Floyd was, Maurice Gordon was driving southbound on the Garden State Parkway in a black Honda Civic.

He had left his hometown of Poughkeepsie, New York, and wasnâ€™t acting like himself, prompting a friend to call police to perform a welfare check on Gordon.

Gordon, whose vehicle continued to run out of gas and break down as he traveled, would interact with New Jersey police four times in the early morning hours of May 23. The last stop happened hours after the first. State Police Sgt. Randy Wetzel stopped Gordon for driving 110 miles per hour near Exit 50 in Bass River.
