NEWARK — A pedestrian who was killed in Newark by a car fleeing a state trooper has been identified as an Essex County man.

Shegan Rubin, 32, of Upper Montclair, was walking near Central Avenue when he was run over by a vehicle driven by Newark resident Alqamar Anderson, said Sgt. Adam Grossman, a spokesman for the State Police.

A trooper saw Anderson, 35, commit "several" moving violations on Route 280 East just minutes before the crash and tried to pull him over, but he fled in his 2002 Lincoln Continental, police said.

Anderson led police on a chase into the city and ran a red light near Norfolk Street and Central Avenue, where his car struck an ambulance and then hit Rubin, he said.

Rubin died of injuries a short time later, said police, while Anderson suffered minor injuries. The driver and the passenger of the ambulance were not hurt.

Anderson has been charged with vehicular manslaughter, eluding, assault by auto, driving while intoxicated and cocaine possession, said police. He is being held in the Essex County Correctional Facility in lieu of $500,000 bail.

Rubin was the head chef for the Hunger Construction food truck, a mobile eatery that specializes in stuffed potatoes and was recently profiled in The Star-Ledger.
