The Galveston County Sheriff's Office is investigating how a suspect died after paramedics injected him with a sedative Friday night.

Deputies say Jeronimo Zamora Jr., 46, suffered cardiac arrest after EMS crews injected him with a sedative to calm him down.

Investigators say Zamora's girlfriend called 911 just before midnight to report that he was screaming and had a knife in his hand.

When deputies arrived at the home on Avenue H, they said they spotted Zamora standing outside yelling and noticed a large gash on his arm.

When they tried to help him, deputies said he struggled and even tried to grab one of their guns. Officers had to spray him with pepper spray.

Once they had him under control, investigators said EMS crews administered a sedative to Zamora so he could be safely transported to the hospital.

An earlier news release from teh Galveston County Sheriff's Office stated the suspect died after being secured for transport in an ambulance, but officials have now clarified the suspect died before reaching the ambulance.
