BALLSTON SPA - A Saratoga County grand jury has indicted a dead man on two felony murder charges.

Jack Retta, 36, was indicted Thursday on two counts of second-degree murder, despite the fact that he was shot to death by police July 11 following a standoff at his Glenville (Schenectady County) home.

Saratoga County District Attorney James Murphy III explained that the reason the grand jury indicted Retta was because of a separate grand jury investigation into whether police were justified in using deadly force by shooting him.

A copy of the grand jury's indictment will be sent to Schenectady County so a grand jury there can determine whether police were warranted in shooting Retta, Murphy said.

The standoff came as police attempted to search Retta's home while investigating the July 7 killings of 58-year-old George Kottke and 44-year-old Mary Orchid in Edinburg.

Their bodies were found in Kottke's home near the Great Sacandaga Lake on July 9, each with multiple stab wounds, police said.

When police attempted to search Retta's home two days afterward, police said Retta held them off with a shotgun. After a 2-hour standoff, police said Retta came out of his home and shot a tree that an officer was using as cover.

Police then shot Retta, who went back inside his home and was found dead later.

Instead of members of the Schenectady grand jury simply being told that Retta killed Kottke and Orchid, Murphy said, the murder indictment against Retta will give them relevant details of the police investigation, such as the fact that the blood of the victims was found in Retta's car and on his clothes.

The indictment against Retta only includes details of the double homicide in Edinburg, Murphy said, and doesn't include information about the standoff in Glenville.
