At a news conference Saturday, police officials apologized to Mr. Colon's family. ''This was completely an unintentional act and a tragic mistake,'' Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said yesterday. The homicide squad and internal affairs bureau are investigating and will report their findings to the Suffolk County district attorney's office, he added.

Mr. Colon was mourned yesterday at the Victory Church of God in East Patchogue, where his family attends services and his uncle is a pastor.

''Everybody was crying in church,'' said Adrian Ramdoo, a relative of Mr. Colon's and a member of the church. ''I broke down and cried today myself.'' Mr. Colon's grandfather, Charles Seaton, said his grandson had been studying draftsmanship and photography at Briarcliffe College on Long Island and was working in graphic design.

Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said yesterday that just before the gun went off, officers had asked Mr. Colon and the other man who stepped outside, identified as Aaron Hatcher, 20, to drop to the ground. Mr. Hatcher had complied, the lieutenant said, but Mr. Colon had not. ''He was still moving down the steps toward the officers,'' the lieutenant said. ''If he's moving toward them, they're not going to continue to rush him, which probably led to the lead man stopping.''

Mr. Colon did not have weapons or drugs with him, the lieutenant said.

The police would not identify the officer whose gun discharged yesterday, but Newsday reported that he is Tony Gonzalez, a 14-year veteran of the Police Department.
