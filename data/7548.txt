BLUE SPRINGS, Neb. (AP) -- An autopsy has been ordered on the body of a Blue Springs man who was shot to death during a 13-hour standoff at his home with police.

Gage County Attorney Randy Ritnour said Monday that 62-year-old Gene Zarybnicky was found dead in a doorway around 7:15 a.m. Sunday.

Ritnour says the autopsy would be done Monday.

The standoff began Saturday evening after a neighbor called police when Zarybnicky showed up at the neighbor's house carrying a pistol. Zarybnicky then went to his own house.

Ritnour says Zarybnicky stepped out of his house early Sunday and fire at the officers, who fired back. He was found dead inside about three hours later.

Ritnour says no one else was in Zarybnicky's home during the incident.
