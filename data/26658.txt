A Clifton motorcyclist was killed in a head-on crash into a car after police said they attempted to stop him from driving erratically Wednesday.

Joshua Montan, 20, was taken to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center after the crash where he died, said Camelia Valdes, the Passaic County prosecutor.

Before the crash, police attempted to stop Montan near Clifton and Main avenues at about 4:15 p.m. Wednesday after they saw him "driving erratically," Valdes said.

Montan then crossed over into the opposite lane and the prosecutor's office said he continued to drive erratically. He crashed into a 2013 Toyota Camry driven by Carol Ference, a 75-year-old Clifton woman who was not injured in the collision.
