MUSCLE SHOALS, AL (WAFF) - The Alabama Bureau of Investigation is looking into an officer involved shooting that left one person dead in the Shoals.



Agents said two men got into an altercation at the Dearborn Townhouse Apartments around 9:30 Wednesday night. Investigators said 38-year-old Shane Rea of Phil Campbell pulled out a knife and began stabbing 30-year-old Randall McGee repeatedly.

Two Muscle Shoals police officers responded to the scene and ordered Rea to drop his weapon. Officers said he refused and that's when one of the officers fired a shot. Rea and McGee were taken to the hospital for treatment but Rea died.



The Colbert County coroner said his body will be transported to the forensics lab in Huntsville Thursday morning for an autopsy. McGee's condition is unknown.



This is the third officer involved shooting in three weeks across the Tennessee Valley.



Monday, Huntsville Police officers shot Samuel Ward during a traffic stop. The officers said he fired at them first. Ward is in critical condition at Huntsville Hospital and he's charged with two counts of attempted murder.

Two weeks ago, Madison County investigators said Joseph Shriver shot Deputy Brent Beavers and Fayetteville, Tennessee police officer Justin Raby. Investigators said both Beavers and Raby tried to stop Shriver after a reported armed robbery.
