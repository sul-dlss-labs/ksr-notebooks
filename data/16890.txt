The apparent suicide of a woman inside a home in south Lincoln Wednesday will be treated as an in-custody death, Lincoln police said.

A friend of the 31-year-old woman called 911 at 10:49 a.m. to report she was suicidal.

Officers arrived at the home on Whitlock Place to help, and were outside the home when they heard a gunshot.

The woman inside died of an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Nebraska law calls for a grand jury investigation of all deaths in which police are present.
