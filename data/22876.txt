Authorities have identified a 44-year-old man who was fatally shot last week by a Las Animas County sheriff’s deputy after investigators say he attacked the officer.

Kristian Martinez died at about 9 p.m. on Oct. 11 at or near a home on the 20500 block of Colorado 12 near the town of Valdez, about 10 miles west of Trindad.

According to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, deputies were called to the home on reports of a shed fire. When they arrived, they found Martinez outside and allegedly acting suspiciously, though officials have not elaborated on his behavior.

“The man ran from the law enforcement officials, then apparently attacked the deputies as they attempted to subdue him,” CBI said in a news release this week. “The man was shot during the altercation and later pronounced dead.”

Authorities believe Martinez is a relative of the home’s owner.

CBI agents are working with the Las Animas County Sheriff’s Office and area prosecutors to investigate the shooting,

Deputy Henry Trujillo is on paid administrative leave pending the probe’s completion.

“This is an active and ongoing investigation,” the release said. “Information will be released as it becomes available. ”
