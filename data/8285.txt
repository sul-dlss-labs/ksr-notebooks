A knife-wielding man stabbed an East Hartford police dog, lunged at officers and was shot and killed, report police. Now state police and the Hartford State's Attorney's office are investigating.

The person who was killed was identified at Taurean Wilson, 26, of Hartford.

Wilson died of gunshot wounds, the state medical examiner determined. The autopsy was conducted on Sunday.

The ordeal started late Saturday night when Wilson called East Hartford police around 11:30 p.m. and said he had just punched his girlfriend at a home on Woodlawn Circle and she was bleeding, police said.

Inside, police heard yelling and forced their way into the home, where a man holding a knife confronted them, police said.

Wilson refused to put the knife down, spokesman Hugh Benettieri said. When the police K-9 was put into action, the suspect stabbed the dog several times.

Police said Wilson still refused to put down the knife, and when he continued toward the officers, they opened fire. Wilson was treated at the scene and transported to Hartford Hospital, where he was treated and later pronounced dead.

Town Officer Todd Mona was shot in the leg during Saturday night's incident, but police haven't disclosed how that happened. Mona was transported to Saint Francis Hospital in Hartford with non-life threatening injuries. Authorities said the man did not have a gun.

Mona remained in the hospital Monday and is resting comfortably, police said. Primo, his K-9, is also resting comfortably at the vet.

When they are back on their feet - or paws -- they will be reunited and return to work.

Connecticut State Police Major Crime Squad and the Hartford County State's Attorney's office have begun an immediate investigation.
