Carlos Heredia Jr., a 17-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police officer Tuesday, Jan. 18, in the 22100 block of Roscoe Boulevard in West Hills, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Shortly after midnight, police responded to a report of an attempted robbery of two people outside a gas station on Topanga Canyon and Roscoe boulevards, said LAPD Officer Bruce Borihanh.

As police arrived, they began chasing a possible suspect, later identified as Carlos Heredia Jr., on foot.

During the chase, Heredia allegedly displayed a handgun. At that point, a police officer shot him, Borihanh said.

Authorities called the Los Angeles Fire Department, who arrived and pronounced Heredia dead.

Borihanh said a handgun was recovered at the scene.

LAPD officials identified the officer who shot Heredia as Dennis Cunningham, a veteran of more than 12 years. Cunningham fired his weapons several times, according to police.

A review of the officer-involved shooting will be conducted by the LAPD Force Investigation Division, as well as the Police Chief, the Office of the Inspector General and Board of Police Commissioners and the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, officials said.
