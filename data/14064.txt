Update at 8:30 p.m.:

Metro Police believe two officers acted in self-defense when they shot an Antioch woman who they said pointed a pistol at them Tuesday afternoon, according to a preliminary investigation.

The South Precinct officers involved will remain on routine administrative assignments while the investigation into the incident continues, police spokesman Don Aaron said.

The woman they shot, 52-year-old Pamela Hutcherson, is in critical condition after surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

Officers were called to the Cambridge Forest Townhomes on Bridgecrest Drive on Tuesday at 4:47 p.m. by Hutcherson’s daughter, who said her mother was threatening to kill herself and had already opened fire at the family’s dog.

When authorities arrived, they saw Hutcherson armed with a pistol and standing near the condo’s front door, Aaron said. When the officers told her to put down her weapon, she closed the door of the condo. After the two officers kicked open the door, police said Hutcherson tried to close the door again and then pointed her pistol at the officers.

“Given the totality of the circumstances and what the officers knew at the time, they opened fire,” Aaron said.

Investigators remained on the scene hours after the incident to try to determine the circumstances that led to the incident. Hutcherson’s daughter told police that her mother had been depressed and upset over a family issue earlier in the day.
