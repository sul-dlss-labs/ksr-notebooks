THE MAN GUNNED down by cops outside a Bronx bar on Friday was identified as a 29-year-old from the Bronx who was carrying his brother's ID and had two prior arrests, police sources said yesterday. Kevin Leo, 29, of Riverdale, was fatally shot after he attempted to enter an after-hours joint that was being raided by vice cops - and then fired at the officers, police said. There were two active warrants - one for drugs - out for Leo's arrest, police sources said. He had apparently stolen his younger brother Sean's ID, sources said. Leo was previously arrested for assault and drug possession, sources said. His sister Alice said she had not seen him in several years. He was wearing a bulletproof vest and was carrying a miniature police badge when he tried to barge into Jaritza's Bar in Claremont early Friday. After being confronted by an NYPD sergeant, Leo ran away and began firing at the sergeant and two other officers with a .

357 magnum revolver, police said. The cops shot Leo several times after he refused to drop his weapon, police said. "He was a good guy, but you could tell he had started heading down the wrong path," said a 28-year-old neighbor who grew up with Leo.
