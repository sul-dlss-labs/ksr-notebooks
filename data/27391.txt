LAFAYETTE â€” A review board found a Lafayette Police Department officer who fatally shot a man a week ago followed the department's training standards, according to the department.

Officer Nathan Stoneking shot and killed Dustin Furr on Jan. 20 after Furr allegedly walked towards an officer and pointed a handgun at them, Lt. Matt Gard said in a press release.

Furr allegedly called police and said he was standing at the corner of South 23rd and State streets with a loaded handgun, Gard said. Officers attempted to negotiate with Furr and get him to surrender for 11 minutes.

Stoneking is no longer on administrative leave and will return to patrol duties, Gard said.

The department's criminal investigation was completed and turned over to the Tippecanoe County Prosecutor's Office, Gard said.

Until the criminal case is over, the department will not release any additional details surrounding the case or camera footage, Gard said.
