The BCA is investigating the Metro Transit officer-involved incident. The Minneapolis Police Department is investigating the homicide witnessed by officers.

This is one of three overnight homicides that Minneapolis police are investigating. These are the other two:

At 1:37 am, police were notified that a woman, who had been shot in the 2200 block of North 2nd Street, had turned up at North Memorial Medical Center. Officers responded to the hospital to speak to the woman, but were told she had died from her injuries.

At 1:48 a.m., police were called to the intersection of East Lake Street and Hiawatha Avenue, under the bridge, on a report of a person shot. Police say a group of people in cars had taken over that portion of East Lake Street and were driving recklessly, doing burnouts, and causing damage to the roadway. Two of the individuals got into a dispute and began to shoot at one another. A stray bullet struck a man who had pulled over and gotten out of his car to watch the spectacle. Officers found the man suffering from a gunshot wound. He was transported to Hennepin County Medical Center where he died.

The Hennepin County medical examiner will provide the identity of the victims along with the nature and cause of death in these cases at a later date.
