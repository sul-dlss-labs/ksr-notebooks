A Pearl man is dead following an officer involved shooting overnight.Capt. Brian McGairty said Mark Allan Bartlett, 42, was killed after police say he brandished a gun at an officer in a threatening way when police were called out to a domestic disturbance.

The officer fired one shot, hitting Bartlett, who died of his injuries. McGairty said there hat been chatter on social media likening the shooting to the officer-involved death of 18-year-old Missouri man Michael Brown, which has caused quite a bit of racial tension across the country.

McGairty said, however, that both the officer and the victim in the Pearl shooting are white.

The officer involved in the shooting is currently on administrative leave with pay, which is routine in such a situation.
