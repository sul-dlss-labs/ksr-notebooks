DAYTON, Ohio (WDTN) – Two police officers involved in a shooting in 2017 will not be charged, according to the Montgomery County Prosecutor’s Office.

The Montgomery County Grand Jury heard testimony and evidence concerning an officer‐involved shooting that happened in Wednesday, July 26, 2017, in Harrison Township.

The Prosecutor’s Office said the Montgomery County Drug‐Free Coalition Task Force was targeting known high‐drug offense areas.

Officers witnessed a suspected drug transaction in the parking lot of Kroger’s on Needmore Road in Harrison Township. The officers attempted to stop the suspect, Kesharn Burney, by boxing‐in his vehicle.

Prosecutors say upon being ordered to stop, Burney tried to flee in his vehicle. In doing so, Burney rammed his vehicle into two officers’ vehicles, and then struck a Trotwood Detective.

The Trotwood Detective and a Sheriff’s Deputy both fired their duty weapons at Burney’s vehicle, striking the suspect three times.

The car exited the lot, and proceeded south on North Dixie Drive, being pursued by officers. At the intersection of North Dixie and Ottello Avenue, the suspect’s vehicle crashed. The suspect was transported to Grandview Hospital, where he died a short time later.

Inside Burney’s vehicle, officers found a fully loaded handgun, digital scales, numerous cell phones, illegal drugs, and drug paraphernalia.

Over four days, the Montgomery County Grand Jury heard evidence and testimony from 15 witnesses, including officers, detectives, medical personnel, and others.

All the available evidence was presented to the Grand Jury. Upon consideration of all the testimony and evidence, the Grand Jury returned a no true bill, finding that the officers acted lawfully under the circumstances.
