When officers sought to question Mr. Parrish, he swung at one of them and fled, the police said. At least three officers gave chase, the police said, and after a tussle, Mr. Parrish and some of the officers ended up on the pavement.

The police said that Mr. Parrish pulled out a 9-millimeter gun, and as a lieutenant tried to disarm him, a fellow officer's gun went off, hitting Mr. Parrish. The lieutenant, whose name was not released, broke his thumb and received eight stitches in the struggle.

Four witnesses at the scene yesterday said Mr. Parrish was shot after he had already been subdued.

One witness, Kenneth Bond, 23, said that Mr. Parrish was in handcuffs when an officer shouted, "He's got a gun!" A few seconds later, Mr. Bond said, he heard a single gunshot.

Mr. Parrish was declared dead at 12:36 a.m. Ellen S. Borakove, a spokeswoman for the city medical examiner, said he had been killed by a single shot to the lower back. It was unclear why initial reports indicated that he had been shot in the stomach.

Last night, Mr. Parrish's family gathered at his grandmother's apartment in the Ocean Bay Houses in Far Rockaway and denounced the police, who they said often harassed black men like Mr. Parrish without provocation. Relatives said Mr. Parrish, an avid boxer who worked out at a gym, was trying to get his life together after three years in prison.
