The Hudson County Prosecutor's Office has identified the man they say was shot and killed after he charged at a Jersey City police officer Friday night holding a knife as Khalid Bouaiti.

The name was released this evening by Hudson County Assistant Prosecutor Gene Rubino.

Authorities have described the 44-year-old man as mentally ill and said the release of his name was delayed because of difficulties contacting the man's relatives who do not live in this country.

Acting Hudson County Prosecutor Guy Gregory said yesterday the investigation into the shooting is ongoing and “no determination has been made yet.”

The man, who resided at 239 Fowler Ave. in Jersey City, had locked himself in his apartment around 7 p.m. Friday after a therapist from Jersey City Medical Center had been speaking to him, the Prosecutor’s Office said. Around 8:30 p.m., after repeatedly trying to get the man to open his door, police officers forced their way inside.

Police said they employed “a distraction device and non-lethal pepper ball system,” but failed to disarm the man, who then attempted to attack an officer with a knife. The officer responded by firing several shots from his handgun, officials said.

The man was struck in his head and upper body. He was taken to the Jersey City Medical Center and pronounced dead around 9:30 p.m., officials said.
