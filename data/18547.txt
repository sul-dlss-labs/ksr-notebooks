BULLHEAD CITY, Ariz. (AP) - Authorities in northwestern Arizona have released the name of a woman killed in last weekend's shooting involving a police officer.

Bullhead City police say the woman fatally shot was 44-year-old Amber Lewis.

Officers responded to a 911 call from a residence Sunday night with a woman saying she planned to shoot her girlfriend and then herself.

The first officer who arrived on the scene says he was confronted by a woman pointing what appeared to be a handgun.

Police say the officer fired multiple shots at Lewis, who died at a hospital.

They say the handgun the woman had turned out to be a black airsoft gun which appeared to be a replica of a semi-automatic pistol.
