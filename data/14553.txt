A Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputy who was involved in a shooting Monday morning in the Long Beach area was hospitalized after suffering a gunshot wound to the stomach, according to the sheriff's department.

The male deputy was shot at least once in a confrontation with an individual, who was killed in the shooting. He was recovery Monday evening following surgery, according to the sheriff's department.

The shooting was reported near Long Beach Boulevard and East 69th Way in Long Beach, about 15 miles south of downtown Los Angeles, where witnesses reported hearing several rounds of gunfire.

It followed a traffic stop in Compton that turned into a foot pursuit involving two deputies and a subject armed with a semi-automatic gun, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

"During that inital stop, there was a struggle with our deputies and the suspect," Los Angeles Sheriff's Lt. Steve Jauch said. "He ran, deputies followed, they caught up with him, a second struggle ensued. During that second struggle, the suspect tried to remove one of the deputies' handguns."

Aerial video showed several patrol vehicles at the location and evidence markers on the ground in an alley behind an apartment building.

The subject involved in the confrontation with the deputy died at the scene.

Neighbors described the suspect as a good guy who was planning to finish college.

The shooting happened near the border of Long Beach and Compton, where community members said they worry about officer-involved shootings.

"When we first moved here, you saw and heard a lot of shootings, and that's all you hear," Compton resident Maria Sanchez said. "The cops are there to protect you and to see that they're getting shot at, it's a little bit more scary than (suspects) shooting each other because they hate each other or for some type of crime that they did."
