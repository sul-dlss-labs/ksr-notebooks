Authorities have released the name of a man who was shot and killed by police in Aurora.

The Aurora Sentinel reports 39-year-old Joey Bronson was shot near an East Colfax Avenue motel following a foot chase Wednesday. Investigators say he matched the description of a man who was seen earlier firing a gun.

Police Chief Nick Metz says he reviewed body camera footage from some of the officers involved in the shooting, and it showed them clearly shouting for the man to drop his gun.

Bronson has a lengthy arrest record in Colorado dating back to the 1990s that includes arrests on drug and weapons charges.

Aurora police also shot and killed an attempted murder suspect on Friday. His name has not been released.
