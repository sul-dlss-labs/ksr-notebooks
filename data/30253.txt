CHESAPEAKE, Va. - A driver crashed and was killed on impact during a police pursuit in Chesapeake early Sunday morning.

According to the Chesapeake Police Department, at around 2:14 a.m., officers saw a vehicle driving erratically at the intersection of Berkley Avenue and Campostella Road. Police believed the driver, 43-year-old Marcus Jeffries, may have been driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol.

Officers attempted to stop the vehicle near Liberty Street and Old Atlantic Avenue, but the vehicle drove away from the area.

Officers pursued the vehicle down Old Atlantic Avenue, where it turned onto Ohio Street and drove through the surrounding neighborhoods. Police said that due to the suspect vehicle's increasing speed, they slowed down and started to lose sight of the vehicle.
