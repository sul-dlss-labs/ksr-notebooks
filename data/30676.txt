COTTONWOOD — A man was killed Tuesday night after being shot by police during a standoff.

Deputies on the scene reported that Cottonwood police responded to a call on Cottonwood Road concerning a domestic dispute. Houston County Sheriff’s deputies arrived on scene later to assist.

Roads were barricaded for several hours while negotiations took place and the suspect exited the residence brandishing a firearm. Deputies said he refused to drop his weapon and they shot the man. He was taken to a local hospital, but later died of his injuries.

HCSO Maj. Bill Rafferty said the sheriff’s office will not be commenting on the case as it is being investigation by the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency’s Special Bureau of Investigations.

ALEA did not respond to media inquiries on Wednesday. At this time, the name of the suspect has not been released.
