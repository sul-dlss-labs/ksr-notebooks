A Reston resident shot and killed a “suspected intruder” late Friday night, according to police.

Daniel Matheson, 29, of Reston was killed in the incident, which happened in an apartment community on the 12000 block of Starboard Drive.

The tenant found Matheson standing in his doorway with a firearm “pointing in his direction,” according to the Fairfax County Police Department. He shot the 29-year-old in the chest.

Matheson was pronounced dead at a local hospital.

Police do not believe the two men knew each other. Detectives continue to conduct interviews and process evidence. The Office of the Commonwealth’s Attorney will determine if charges will be placed.
