RICHMOND — The teenage boy who showed up at a Richmond middle school Thursday was armed with two guns at the time, multiple high-ranking sources with knowledge of the investigation tell Call 6 Investigates.

The 14-year-old boy’s mother called police after he took a male family member hostage and forced them to drive him to his former middle school, sources tell Call 6. The drive to the school was just a little more than a mile.

Multiple sources say the boy was armed with a .45-caliber handgun and a .223-caliber rifle with a scope attached.

When responding officers first arrived at the school the boy was at a vehicle, trying to unload something. He quickly ran inside the school with the guns.

Once inside the school, the boy started shooting at the officers before eventually turning the gun on himself, police say.

While some officers followed the boy inside, others stayed out and found explosive devices inside the vehicle. Sources say investigators believe the boy was trying to take those devices inside the school, but because police arrived so quickly, he couldn’t gather them.

If the boy’s mother didn’t call 911 to allow police and the school extra time, the situation could’ve been much worse, the sources say.
