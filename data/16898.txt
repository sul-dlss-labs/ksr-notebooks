Federal prosecutors announced Friday that they would not file charges against an off-duty Baltimore County police officer who fatally shot a man in Washington’s Union Station last year. Man fatally shot by off-duty police officer in Union Station According to a police charging document, a female relative tried to take a butcher knife from Rashad Bugg-Bey to stop him from hurting himself in Union Station’s Metrorail stop on Nov. 14, 2015. At some point during the struggle, Bugg-Bey cut the woman on her cheek and the 25-year-old walked up the escalator, according to the document.

It was then — around 8:17 p.m. — that the off-duty Baltimore County police officer who had just entered the station spotted the woman running and screaming and saw Bugg-Bey holding the knife, prosecutors said. The officer — whose name was not released — announced from the top of the escalator he was with law enforcement and ordered Bugg-Bey to drop the knife.

Bugg-Bey failed to obey, according to police, and pointed the knife at the officer as he reached the top of the escalator. The officer fired his weapon. Prosecutors said in between firing multiple rounds, the officer continued to order Bugg-Bey to drop the knife.

Prosecutors said if Bugg-Bey had exited the escalator with the knife, “he would have had access to additional civilians located in the boarding areas” of Union Station as well as in the shopping and restaurant areas.

Bugg-Bey died of his injuries on Dec. 22.

After interviews with witnesses and reviewing security footage, prosecutors said in a statement released Friday that they found “insufficient evidence” to prove “beyond a reasonable doubt” that the officer used excessive force.
