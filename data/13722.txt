A suicidal man shot by a sheriff’s deputy Wednesday morning was holding two guns when he was killed, authorities said.

Marty Maiden II, 20﻿, called 911 at about 7:30 a.m., telling the dispatcher he was going to kill himself. He barricaded himself in his family’s home in the 7500 block of South Woodbury Grove Drive, southwest of Tucson.

Deputies were unable to make contact with Maiden, and at about 9:30 a.m. the SWAT team was called in, Deputy Courtney Rodriguez﻿, spokeswoman for the Pima County Sheriff’s Department, said in a news release.

“Deputies made contact with Mr. Maiden outside of the residence,” she said. He was “armed with a semiautomatic rifle and a shotgun and presented a threat to SWAT team members.”

Deputy Gilbert Caudillo﻿ fired a single round, killing Maiden, Rodriguez said. Caudillo, a 12-year veteran, was placed on administrative leave.

Maiden, an Army soldier, was on leave from deployment to Afghanistan. He was in Tucson to attend his father’s funeral. On Oct. 31, SWAT was called to the same address after the elder Maiden, 51, threatened suicide.

After a prolonged standoff, the elder Maiden was taken to a hospital with self-inflicted injuries, Rodriguez said.

The elder Maiden, who had health problems, died Nov. 3, according to postings from the family on Facebook and from an online obituary website.
