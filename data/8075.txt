Central Mo. man dies after shots exchanged, high-speed chase

The Highway Patrol reports Thomas Paul Deeken, 39, Koeltstown died of a self-inflicted gun shot wound to the head.

He was facing assault charges and was due in court today. But Osage County Sheriff Carl Fowler says Deeken had called in threats to the prosecuting attorney’s office at the Osage County Courthouse.

Those threats sparked a search for Deeken with a description of the motorcycle he was riding.

After a chase through Osage and Cole counties, gunshots were exchanged and an officer rear-ended Deeken’s motorcycle to stop him. Deeken was thrown from the bike and then turned one of his guns on himself, shooting himself in the head. He was flown to University Hospital in Columbia, where he died from his wounds.
