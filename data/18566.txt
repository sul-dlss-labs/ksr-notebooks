A man who was a suspect of a hit-and-run wreck in Lauderdale County died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound Thursday, Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said.

Deputies found the suspect's body in a shed behind a home on County Road 428 in Killen at 5:58 p.m., Singleton said.

The accident happened at a separate location on Highway 72. Authorities said the suspect left the scene in his vehicle and fled to the home. When deputies tried to approach the suspect, they heard gunshots, Singleton said. Deputies were not sure at the time whether the suspect was shooting into the air or at deputies.

The suspect has not been identified as of Thursday night.

The wreck is being investigated by Alabama State Troopers. Trooper Johnathan Appling said the accident happened near County Road 31 on highway 72. No serious injuries were reported due to the accident, he said.
