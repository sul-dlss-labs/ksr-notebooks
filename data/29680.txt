SAN PABLO — Moments after safety concerns canceled a police pursuit of a man in a reportedly stolen vehicle, the driver was killed in a crash Tuesday morning, authorities said.

The name of the man killed, a 25-year-old Richmond resident, has not been released.

The driver of the other vehicle, a 34-year-old Hayward resident, suffered non-life-threatening injuries and was transported to a hospital.

Police said the pursuit began at about 8 a.m. Tuesday in the 14500 block of San Pablo Avenue after officers attempted to stop a 1993 Dodge Intrepid reported stolen Monday afternoon.

The driver failed to stop, and a pursuit began northbound on San Pablo Avenue.

Police said officers canceled the pursuit because of unsafe reckless driving by the Dodge’s driver.

Within a short time, officers discovered the Dodge had collided with a 2004 Toyota Matrix traveling southbound on San Pablo Avenue just north of the Richmond Parkway.

Officers began administering life-saving measures to the Richmond man but he died at the scene.

Both directions of San Pablo Avenue remained closed into the afternoon.

Per Contra Costa County protocol, the San Pablo Police Department is jointly investigating what occurred with the Contra Costa County District Attorney’s Office and the California Highway Patrol.

Anyone with information is encouraged to contact the San Pablo Police Department at 510-215-3150. All callers can remain anonymous.
