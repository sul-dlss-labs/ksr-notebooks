Mesa police are investigating the death of a suspect in a fatal stabbing who opened fire after leading officers on a short pursuit, police said Wednesday.

One officer discharged his service weapon during Tuesday night's incident, but police do not know if 27-year-old Cesar Enriquez died as a result of police fire or a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Sgt. Esteban Flores, a Mesa police spokesman.

Officers were called to an area near Broadway Road and Pioneer about 10:15 p.m. on reports that shots had been fired, Flores said.

Enriquez led officers on a short foot pursuit before he confronted an officer with a gun and fired one shot into the air, Flores said.

The Maricopa County Sherrif's Office confirmed that Enriquez had been a suspect in a Queen Creek homicide earlier Tuesday morning before his altercation with Mesa Police, Flores said.

No officers were injured, and detectives are investigating the incident.
