A SWAT callout at a Westside home that began Tuesday night with a domestic dispute is over after police found a man dead inside his home in the 10400 block of Hamlet Terrace, according to the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

Officers were first called to the home southeast of Interstate 10 and Chaffee Road just before 6:30 p.m. after issues were reported between a man and his wife, the Sheriff’s Office said.

The wife told officers that her husband had multiple guns in the home and that she was in fear for her safety because he had fired a shot. She said he also made statements that he would harm himself, police said.

The woman was able to get out of the house safely. SWAT then tried for hours to contact the husband inside the home.

Ultimately they forced the door open and found the man dead inside from what is being investigated as a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.
