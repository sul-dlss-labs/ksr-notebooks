High-speed police chase in Webster County

A high-speed police pursuit in Webster County early today ended with a crash.

An early morning chase today in Fort Dodge between law enforcement and a motorcyle brought injuries to both the cyclist and his passenger.

The Iowa State Patrol identified the motorcyclist as 40-year-old Terry Witte and his passenger 31-year-old Angela Edgerton, both of Clare.

Authorities say the motorcycle operated by Edgerton was attempting to elude Fort Dodge police officers when he lost control of the cycle and then heading down a steep ravine.

Both Witte and Edgerton were ejected. They were then airlifted to a Des Moines hospital for treatment; their conditions not being released.
