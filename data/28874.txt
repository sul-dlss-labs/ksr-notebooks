MARION â€” A man who shot himself during a standoff with Marion Police has died from his wounds.

Interim Chief Jay McDonald said at 1:26 p.m. Wednesday officers from the Marion Police Department were informed by 911 dispatchers that a man was threatening to harm himself in the 1300 block of Crescent Heights Road, just off of Barks Road East on the south side of Marion.

McDonald said when officers arrived at the scene, they found a man, identified in a police incident report as Craig L. Hottinger, 49, Marion, behind an apartment complex on Crescent Heights. He was pacing back and forth along a fence line outside the apartment building and had a handgun in his possession.

According to a statement from MPD, a negotiator from the police department "initiated communication with the subject as other officers worked to remove bystanders from the area. Multiple area businesses were placed on lockdown."

Barks Road East was closed between Delaware Avenue and Wellness Drive during the incident, which lasted about three hours.

Despite the negotiator's efforts, the man shot himself around 4:50 p.m.

"We were attempting to negotiate his safe surrender to get him the help he needed and we were unsuccessful in achieving that," McDonald said Wednesday evening.

McDonald said the Marion Fire Department's emergency squad transported the man to OhioHealth Marion General Hospital for treatment. He was later transported to Grant Medical Center in Columbus.

Police department officials said due to the nature of the incident and out of respect for the man's family, they declined to make any further statements.
