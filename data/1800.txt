The Cook County medical examiner's office said Tuesday that it needs more details from police before determining the cause of death for a man who collapsed after being arrested on the South Side.

Police said William Robinzine, 45, of the 7900 block of South Green Street appeared to be on drugs and was holding his bleeding hand when police were investigating a quarrel in a liquor store near 79th Street and Cottage Grove Avenue about midnight Monday.

After an ambulance was called, Robinzine became combative and tried to drive off in the vehicle, police said. Robinzine was pulled from the ambulance and restrained by officers, police said.

Robinzine was taken to Jackson Park Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

The medical examiner's office found evidence of heart trouble. The office also said he had abrasions but they weren't life-threatening. Toxicology tests will take weeks to report.
