Printer Friendly Email to a Friend Identity Released of Man Who Died Following Police Chase

The name of the man who died at the end of a police chase late Monday night in Pawnee and Richardson Counties has been released, as the investigation into incident continues.

The victim is identified as 19-year-old Justin Kanniard, whose last known residence was in Pawnee City and Steinauer.

Kanniard was driving a blue Dodge pickup that led officers from the Nebraska State Patrol, Pawnee and Richardson County Sheriff’s Departments on a high-speed chase from near Pawnee City to just east of Humboldt, where the pickup ran off the road into a soybean field.

Authorities say Kanniard died after tying one end of a rope to the pickup and the other end around his neck before jumping out of the vehicle while it was still moving.

According to the latest information, the chase ended a half-mile north of Highway 4 on 636 Avenue – not 646 Avenue as had been previously reported.

No additional information is yet available as the investigation continues.
