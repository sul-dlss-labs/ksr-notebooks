Witnesses said that the car had been rear-ended by the police S.U.V., causing it to sideswipe the truck. "The cop car hit the red car, and the car hit the pickup, and it careened off into the little kid," said Victor Ousley, 48, of Irvington, N.J., who said he was walking down the street when he witnessed the accident.

The boy's mother, Wendy Howard, said that when she got to the scene of the accident she could see just one of her son's legs sticking out from under the car. She could identify him only because of the shorts and sneakers he was wearing, she said.

Chief Cleary said that it was not clear whether the police S.U.V. had struck the red sedan, but that all three vehicles involved in the accident had been taken to the Essex County prosecutor's office for forensic examination. Orange police said last night that no one could be reached for comment on the accident.

According to Chief Cleary, guidelines for car chases are set by the state attorney general's office based on a number of factors, including the reason for giving chase. The speed of the chase was unclear, Chief Cleary said, though Victoria Brown, the victim's grandmother, said the vehicles were clearly traveling well above the speed limit. Dennis, who was an eighth grader at Patrick Francis Healy Middle School, wanted to be a police officer, his family said. The family had been planning to take him to the movie "Saw II" for his birthday on Wednesday. His 15-year-old sister, Mia, said she had been saving up money to buy him a cellphone.
