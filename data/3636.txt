A 3-year-old valley child is dead after getting a hold of his step-father's gun. The step-father also happens to be a Marshall County Sheriff's Deputy.

An investigation is underway into this tragedy that appears purely accidental.

The shooting happened Saturday night around 7:00 near Grant in Marshall County. Deputy Carl Keller and his wife were on the home's front porch. According to the Sheriff - they were taking care of a wasp nest. They soon heard a gun-shot and went inside.

In the bedroom, they found Deputy Keller's 3-year-old stepson Trent.

He had accidentally shot himself in the abdomen with a 9 mm glock, Keller's back-up gun.

According to the Sheriff - it appears Trent had pulled his stepdad's gun off the bedroom dresser.
