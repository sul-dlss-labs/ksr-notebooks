An Aug. 12 domestic dispute near Peachtree City during which a family member and the residence were doused with gasoline, along with gunshots fired by a 55-year-old male resident, led to mass law enforcement responding to the scene and the man dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. No one else was injured.

Sheriff Barry Babb said deputies on Aug. 12 at 8:56 p.m. responded to a reported domestic dispute in the 900 block of Buffalo Road, located in the Shiloh Mobile Home Park off Ga. Highway 54 and adjacent to Peachtree City’s Publix Shopping Center and the now-vacant Steinmart building.

“Initial reports indicated a male resident, Gordon Moss, 55, was involved in a physical altercation with a family member,” Babb said. “The family was able to flee the home as deputies arrived. One family member reported being doused with gasoline and Moss was reportedly pouring gasoline throughout the home as the family left. Deputies reported gunfire from the home shortly after arriving.”

Babb said additional shots were fired from inside the home as members of the Peachtree City Police Department arrived to assist.

Once the residence was contained, occupants of the surrounding homes were evacuated for their safety, Babb noted.

“After numerous attempts to make contact with Moss and additional gunfire from inside the home, entry was made to clear the home,” said Babb. “Moss was found deceased at approximately 2:15 a.m. inside the home from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.”

Babb thanked the residents who were impacted in the area for their understanding as law enforcement tried to resolve a difficult situation.

Babb also thanked the Peachtree City Police Department, the Fayetteville Police Department, the Clayton County Police Department, the Fayette County and Peachtree City Fire and Emergency Services and Coweta/ Fayette EMC for all of the help provided.
