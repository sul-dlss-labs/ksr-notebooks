Fresno, CA – Fresno police releasing new details into the officer involved shooting where 29-year old Oliver Hernandez was killed wielding an ax on January 5 near Bulldog Stadium.

“When the door was open, the swat team threw in what is called a flash bang.” said Deputy Chief Pat Farmer with the Fresno Police Department.

A flash bang knocking the suspect Hernandez off a bed.

“Saw Mr. Hernandez holding an ax or a hatchet about shoulder level.” said Farmer.

Police say that’s when one swat officer fired off three rounds of rubber bullets, reloaded and fired another three rounds of rubber bullets.

“At that point Mr. Hernandez began to get up from his seated position with the ax still held up high and advance towards the officers.”

Police say another swat officer armed with a rifle fired four lethal rounds, all four striking and killing Hernandez in the upper body. It ended a six-hour standoff with police after they Hernandez swung an ax at family members including three children inside an apartment. All managing to escape. But this wasn’t the first time police encountered Hernandez.

“There was a high-profile incident where a school teacher was assaulted.” said Farmer.

It happened in 2016 at John Muir Elementary when Hernandez showed up unannounced and tried to pull his nephew out of his third grade class, but the teacher tried to protect the child.

“Mr. Hernandez produced rebar and struck the teacher several times.”
