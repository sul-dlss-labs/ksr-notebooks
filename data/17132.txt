BELLE GLADE (CBSMiami/AP) — A man is dead after pointing a gun at a police officer.

Authorities say a Palm Beach County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed a driver following a traffic stop where the victim pointed a gun at the deputy.

After the deputy pulled Henry Bennett over in Belle Glade on Saturday, authorities say Bennett got out of the vehicle and ran away.

The deputy chased Bennett and, at one point, authorities said Bennett turned and pointed a gun at the deputy. That's when the deputy fired at Bennett, hitting him twice.

The 19-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities said he has a history that includes drug possession and domestic battery.

The unidentified deputy has been placed on paid leave which is standard protocol during the investigation.
