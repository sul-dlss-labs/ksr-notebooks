PIERRE, S.D. â€” A 30-year-old professional boxer and MMA fighter has died in an officer-involved shooting on the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation, according to an FBI spokesman.

Ryan White Mountain-Soft was in McLaughlin, S.D., when he was killed by a police officer with the Bureau of Indian Affairs in a shooting on the evening of Sunday, March 14. FBI agents responded to the event, says Kevin Smith, a public affairs officer based in Minneapolis.

"The FBI is investigating the circumstances of the shooting," said Smith, in an email. "Because this is an open and active investigation, we cannot make further comment at this time."

A law enforcement agent in Fort Yates, N.D., directed all inquiries to the FBI. Similarly, a person answering the phone at BIA's Great Plains Region office in Aberdeen, S.D., said the BIA in Washington, D.C., handles press requests.

The BIA has yet to respond to a request for more information from Forum News Service.
