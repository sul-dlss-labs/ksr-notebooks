A motorcyclist suspected of driving under the influence and fleeing from Pomona police on Tuesday hit a light pole in Diamond Bar and died, authorities said.

David Ray Vance Adams, 27, was pronounced dead at the scene, coroner’s spokeswoman Sarah Ardalani said. She didn’t have a city of residence for him.

The incident started around 2:30 am. on South Reservoir Street when officers tried to stop a motorcyclist who was possibly DUI, Pomona police spokeswoman Aly Mejia said.

The motorcyclist took off.

He headed south on Diamond Bar Boulevard, where he struck the concrete light pole, Sheriff’s Deputy Juanita Navarro-Suarez, a department spokeswoman, said. It was unclear if officers were still in pursuit right before the crash.
