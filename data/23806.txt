CHESTERFIELD, VA (WWBT) - An hours-long standoff in Chesterfield ended with a hostage being freed, and the suspect dead last week.

A domestic call in the 12000 block of Timber Trail Drive escalated into a barricade after the victim ran to a neighbor's house and the suspect - identified Tuesday as Darryl T. Montgomery, 47 - followed.

According to police, the suspect kicked in the door, fired a gun and then went back home where a man was held hostage for hours.

Police heard gunshots while on the scene.

The hostage was freed, but more gunshots came from the home.

Police attempted to maintain communication with the suspect, but once communication stopped, they entered the home and found the suspect dead.

Police said Tuesday that Montgomery died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

No one else was injured in the standoff, and the scene was cleared early Friday morning.
