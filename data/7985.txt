A young Colorado man who fatally shot himself after a police chase in Big Sur last weekend was identified today as Timothy Fink, 22, of Westcliffe, Colo.

Sheriff‚Äùs investigators said Fink shot himself in the head after a foot chase by deputies and other officers that started when he was involved in a Saturday afternoon traffic accident in the village of Big Sur while driving a stolen car.

Investigators said Fink shot himself with a stolen revolver when he was cornered on a hillside by a deputy and a U.S. Forest Service officer.

A police spokesman in Colorado Springs said Fink was wanted on two felony warrants for auto theft and failure to appear on a burglary charge, and a misdemeanor warrant for shoplifting.

The Mazda Miata he was driving Saturday was reported stolen in Colorado Springs, the spokesman said.
