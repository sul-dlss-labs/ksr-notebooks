A Culpeper Sheriff's Office deputy shot and killed a man Thursday evening, authorities said.



Authorities say the deputy shot Harold Lee Daniels, 59, after he aimed a handgun at them while being arrested. Daniels died at the scene in a home on Oak Forest Drive in Rapidan, Va., about 10 miles south of the city of Culpeper.

Neither of the two deputies present were hurt.



The incident began around 6:45 p.m. when a sheriff's deputy clocked a 2001 Ford Escape driving more than 100 mph on Route 15. The deputy tried to pull over the driver, who didn't stop.

A neighbor told News4's Megan McGrath that she called authorities when she saw a white SUV speeding down White Oak Road, a gravel road.



"You could hear sirens down 15, and you could see the dust coming off the gravel road..." the neighbor said. She said the driver was traveling so fast that "he almost lost it on the gravel road turning into this road, so yeah, he was going pretty fast."



She said she was surprised when sheriff's deputies came to her house because her sister's white SUV was parked in front of the home. They interviewed both sisters and then left to patrol the rest of the neighborhood, she said.



Authorities say they arrived at Daniels' home around 7:25 p.m., where they found Daniels and the vehicle in question.



Another neighbor told McGrath he saw the man who lived that the home talking to officers and filling out some sort of paperwork. It was not immediately known if he was referring to Daniels.



The first neighbor said she heard a "pop" sometime after the deputies left her home.



Authorities say the investigation is ongoing. Culpeper Sheriff Scott Jenkins has turned over the investigation to Virginia State Police.

Daniels' body has been taken to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Manassas for an autopsy.
