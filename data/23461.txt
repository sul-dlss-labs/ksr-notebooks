A Spalding County woman who was shot early Tuesday is in critical condition at Atlanta Medical Center, officials said.

Grady Jack Norton, who deputies believe shot 42-year-old Amber Rae Brown, was holding a weapon next to Brown’s body as deputies entered the 600 block of Cheatham Road in Griffin about 9:15 a.m., Spalding County sheriff’s spokesman Capt. Dwayne Jones said.

A deputy ordered Norton to put down his weapon. That’s when Norton fired one shot into his head, Jones said.

Coroner Sonny Foster pronounced the 52-year-old Griffin man dead.

No additional information was released.

An investigation is ongoing, Jones said.
