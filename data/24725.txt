MIDLAND, Texas (AP) — A New Mexico man who was a suspect in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend has been killed in a confrontation with police in West Texas.

Midland police say officers encountered 41-year-old Oscar Gurrola on Thursday just outside the city. Authorities say he brandished a firearm when officers tried to arrest him on a murder warrant, leading the officers to fire on him.

Gurrola, who was believed to be a resident of Carlsbad, New Mexico, died at the scene.

A news release issued by police indicates more than one officer fired on Gurrola but it’s not clear just how many.

Police had been searching for Gurrola after finding his ex-girlfriend with gunshot wounds hours earlier at a Midland residence.

The 36-year-old woman, Katrina Luna, died after being taken to a hospital.
