A man shot by police Oct. 30 in north Baltimore has died, Baltimore Police Commissioner Michael Harrison said.Police have identified the suspect as John Feggins, 24, of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Police identified the officers in the shooting as Officer Ryan Glass, who has been a member of the BPD since 2005, and Officer Joel Hawk, who has been a member of the BPD since 1999. Police said both are assigned to the Northern District. Harrison said investigators watched several videos of the shooting in the Rite Aid parking lot in the 6300 block of York Road around 9:30 a.m."This subject was shot. We do not know how many times, but we know he was shot," Harrison said. "We do know that the subject has been pronounced dead as a result of this incident." Harrison said a Regional Auto Theft Task Force detective spotted the vehicle matching a description of a car wanted in connection with an Oct. 9 robbery at the Horseshoe Casino. The officer ordered the driver out of the car and learned the driver was a person of interest in the Oct. 9 robbery.Harrison said video showed the suspect lunging at the officer with a gun in his hand. A struggle ensued over the gun, Harrison said."During the interview, what we saw on the video was that the subject launched at the officer with a gun in his hand. There was a struggle that ensued, and that struggle took both of them to the ground, where that struggle continued," Harrison said.The officer and another responding officer discharged their firearms to prevent further harm by Feggins, Harrison said."In an attempt to prevent the subject from shooting himself, the police officers and others in the area, what we know right now is that both our officers discharged their firearms to prevent further harm," Harrison said.Feggins died at a hospital. The two officers suffered minor injuries as a result of the struggle on the ground."The officers, from what we saw in this video, the officer was very professional, very poised, until the struggle ensued," Harrison said. "The officers were out here doing their job, they were engaged following a lead that was given to them."Zac French-Moore said he saw the scene unfold in real time as shots were fired."I heard the shots, and I was on my way up here to pick up a prescription, and I saw about 30 or 40 police cars come zooming by," French-Moore said. "(It) sounded like a couple of pops to me, a couple of pops. I stopped and pulled off to the side, and the saying is, 'You can never be too sure.' I had no idea what was happening."The commissioner and prosecutors will determine whether any video can be released to the public using the department's new critical release policy. The Public Integrity Bureau will conduct an administrative investigation that will be overseen by the consent decree monitor.Both officers involved were put on administrative leave.Stay with WBALTV.com and 11 News for more on this developing story.​
