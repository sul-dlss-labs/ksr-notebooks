Authorities have identified the man who was shot and killed Sunday by police in West Buechel, as well as the two officers involved in the shooting.

Miguel Escalona Vivas, 37, of Louisville, died early Monday morning at the University of Louisville Hospital from a gunshot wound he sustained from police officers, according to Jefferson County deputy coroner Rita Taylor.

The two officers were identified Tuesday as Keith Walz of the West Buechel Police Department and Gary Phelps of the Hurstbourne Acres Police Department.

The shootings happened Sunday afternoon near Bardstown Road and Bashford Manor Lane.

Walz was flagged down by a resident around 4:20 p.m. who said a man was chasing another man with a gun, said Todd Walls, Hurstbourne Acres police chief, at a press conference Tuesday.

When Walz got to the scene, he found two men, one of them shot. Walz asked Escalona Vivas to drop his handgun numerous time and he refused, Walls said.

Walz followed the other suspect down Bardstown Road, when Phelps happened to be coming by, Walls said. Phelps was not on duty nor in uniform, said Steve Griffin, Hurstbourne Acres police chief on Tuesday.

They both confronted Escalona Vivas and told him to drop his gun, but he refused. Both officers fired when Escalona Vivas pointed his gun at them, police said.

Both officers are on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of a Louisville Metro Police Public Integrity Unit investigation.

Walz has been with West Buechel Police for around two years. Phelps has been on the Hurstbourne Acres Police force for a little more than a year.

Neither officer was wearing body cameras, Walls and Griffin said.

The status of the second man who was shot is currently unknown.
