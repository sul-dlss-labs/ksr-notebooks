Adam Troy Weimer, 40, murdered his father and his father's fiancee before killing himself, police said

A 40-year-old Minnesota man fatally beat his father and stepmother-to-be before shooting himself in a standoff with police Tuesday, police said.

Terry Weimer, 68, and Renee Ahrens, his 67-year-old fiancee, were found dead inside their home around midnight in the 1100 block of Dakota Street in the Twin Cities suburb of Shakopee, police said according to the Star-Tribune, which identified the couple after asking neighbors.

The couple had been 'beaten pretty badly,' police said.

Afterwards, cops traced the woman's vehicle to the town of Waseca, about an hour's car ride south, where it was discovered unoccupied outside the home of Weimer's son, Adam Troy Weimer.

At the younger Weimer's house, officers tried to coax him into giving up until noon, when cops entered the residence.

Weimer was found dead inside his home from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police told the Star-Tribune Weimer has a 'criminal history' and the paper reported he'd been convicted for theft, drunk driving and assault.

According to family and neighbors who spoke to the Star-Tribune, the murdered couple were both retired substitute teachers who were planning to get married.

'She was an unbelievable person, so full of life,' said Glenn Ahrens, a former brother-in-law of the dead woman. 'She was just someone that everybody liked.'
