A 53-year-old woman has died of injuries suffered when a car she was riding in was struck by a vehicle fleeing police along Wilmington's northern border, state police said Sunday.

The woman killed was identified as Mary L. Smith of Wilmington.

Sgt. Paul Shavack said she was the front-seat passenger in a Pontiac G6 that was struck Thursday night at East Lea Boulevard and North Market Street, at the city line.

Smith died late Friday afternoon, Shavack said.

He said Stephen J. Jefferis, 32, who was driving a Ford Mustang that struck the Pontiac, was released Friday morning from Christiana Hospital into the custody of troopers.

Jefferis was charged with assault, disregarding an officer's signal, driving under the influence of heroin and alcohol and related counts.

He is being held at Young Correctional Institution in Wilmington in lieu of $26,203 cash bond.

After Smith's death, Shavack said additional charges are under review.
