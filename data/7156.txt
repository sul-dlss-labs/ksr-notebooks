Officers were called to the 2800 block of South State Street at approximately 2 a.m. Sunday after receiving reports of a domestic disturbance.

Police arrested 26-year-old Antonio Dampier, who, later, was taken to a hospital and died.

Authorities say he fell out of the back of the wagon and hit his head while trying to escape, but Dampier's relatives say he died under different circumstances. They say he was taken from the scene in a squad car, and they do not know how the wagon ended up being involved. Relatives believe Dampier was beaten by police officers.
