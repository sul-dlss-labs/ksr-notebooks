The man involved in an altercation in a duplex with police west of the Twin Cities was armed and was the one who shot and wounded an officer before a sheriff’s deputy fatally shot the suspect, investigators said Thursday.

The update about the Sunday afternoon confrontation in Hutchinson, Minn., by the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) revealed for the first time the circumstances surrounding the death of Luverne Roy Christensen, 49, following a verbal disturbance in the 500 block of Harmony Lane SW.

The wounded officer was identified as Jacob Willers, who joined the Hutchinson police force fewer than three weeks earlier.

The officer who shot Christensen was Matthew Wyatt, the BCA said. He’s been with the McLeod County Sheriff’s Office since 2013.

In the most detailed disclosure yet, the BCA said:

Hutchinson police officers, McLeod County sheriff’s deputies and State Patrol troopers answered a 911 call about a verbal conflict in the upper level of the duplex. The caller warned that someone there might have a gun.

Law enforcement officers negotiated with Christensen through an upper-level window.

After about an hour, he came down to the front entry but ignored officers’ repeated requests to show his hands. He then retreated into the vestibule.

Officers entered “and an altercation ensued [and] Christensen produced a handgun and fired once, striking Officer Willers. Deputy Wyatt returned fire, striking Christensen.”

Christensen was pronounced dead at the scene by medical personnel. Willers was treated for his injuries and is now on medical leave.

No other law enforcement officers fired their weapons.

The BCA continues its investigation and will turn its findings over to the McLeod County attorney’s office for review.
