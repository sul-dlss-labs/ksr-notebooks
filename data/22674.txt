Police have identified the man who killed himself at a traffic stop in Prince George County on Saturday night as Justin Asa Marzigliano.

Marzigliano, 19, of Prince George was one of three passengers in a pickup truck that state police stopped about 9 p.m. as part of the investigation of an earlier shooting at a state trooper's home.

Authorities say both shootings may be related but have not released more details.

At 1:30 p.m. Saturday, authorities answered a call to investigate a shot that struck a trooper's house in the Disputanta area, said state police Sgt. Thomas A. Cunningham. No one was home when the shot was fired.

About 9 p.m., police located a pickup truck that matched the description of a vehicle that a witness saw outside the trooper's home earlier. Officers ordered the teenagers inside the truck to step out. Two people did, and police then heard a single gunshot, Cunningham said.

Police found Marzigliano with the wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Cunningham said officers recovered several weapons from the vehicle. One of the two juveniles who got out of the car, a 16-year-old boy, was charged with drugs and weapons possession.
