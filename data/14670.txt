CHARLOTTE, N.C. â€” The family of a man shot and killed by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department after a standoff late Wednesday night hopes to get answers when they meet with detectives Thursday night.



Police say a member of the Violent Criminal Apprehension Team (VCAT) shot Devaron Wilburn, 21, at a north Charlotte motel after Wilburn fired at officers trying to arrest him.



Channel 9 talked to Wilburn's family. They said CMPD has told them nothing about what led up to the shooting.



"We need to know what happened from beginning to end," said Candice Green, stepmother.



Wilburn's family was hoping to speak with CMPD Investigators Thursday night about what happened.



They said Wilburn told them Monday night that officers fired at him first on West Trade Street.



Wilburn leaves behind a 4-month-old daughter.



VCAT officers had been searching for Wilburn since Monday night, when police said he fired at officers on West Trade Street and then disappeared.



They went public with his identity Wednesday warning that he was possibly armed and dangerous and asking for information that would help officers find him.



When they got a call to the Inn Town Suites Wednesday night police confirmed that Wilburn was in a motel room with a woman and after the woman left the room they tried to get Wilburn to give himself up, while residents of the motel waited in their rooms.



"We were just sitting here watching TV and we heard a little more rumbling and then, 'Pow, pow," said Dontae Gray.



"At some point he opened the door armed with a handgun at which time one of our members from VCAT fired one shot," said Police Chief Rodney Monroe.



Police said Wilburn was hit in the stomach and later died at the Carolinas Medical Center.
