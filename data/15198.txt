KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Police have identified a man who was shot and killed by a Kansas City, Mo., police officer as 41-year-old Ymauo Erwin.

Police said officers responded to a disturbance call around midnight at a home in the 4200 block of NW 57th Terrace on Oct. 9. Police said the man was armed with a samurai sword.

Office Tye Grant with the Kansas City, Mo., police said the suspect and his girlfriend were fighting.

Relatives at the home referred to him as ‘Edwin’ when talking with FOX 4’s Kathy Quinn. When police arrived, they found him behind the residence. Police said he was very confrontational and threatened police with the sword. That’s when an officer shot and killed him.

His aunt says she wished the police had contacted his family first so they could calm him down.

“Of course, I’m upset,” Alimiter Agrippa, aunt, said. “They could have just shoot his leg or somewhere on his arm. Shoot him, kill him? What? Just because we’re Micronesian, or what? That’s one thing I want to know. Why can’t they talk to family to stop him? Or they could shoot his leg.”

Agrippa said her nephew worked at a rental car company at the airport and was a nice, quiet guy.

Police said the investigation is ongoing.
