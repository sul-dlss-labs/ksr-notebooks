Man shot and killed by police at Fayetteville Sonic restaurant was wanted for sex crimes

FAYETTEVILLE (WTVD) -- Authorities say a man shot and killed by a Cumberland County deputy Friday was a sex offender who did not register and was wanted for sex offenses in Durham County.

Investigators identified the man killed at a fast-food restaurant as 38-year-old Brian Burch.

It happened just before noon at the Sonic Drive-In restaurant in the 5900 block of Cliffdale Road.

Two Cumberland County deputies were involved in the shooting while issuing an arrest warrant, the sheriff's office said.

Investigators said the deputies were conducting a traffic stop at the Sonic. When they approached the driver, they said he was cutting his arms and neck with a knife or a similar weapon.

The deputies then tried to use a Taser on the man, but authorities said it had no effect. As they got into a fight trying to arrest him, a spokeswoman said the man cut the deputies. That prompted one deputy to open fire, shooting at least once, and killing the man.

One deputy sustained a minor hand injury.

Cumberland County Sheriff's Office lawyer Ronnie Mitchell told The Fayetteville Observer (http://bit.ly/1t5B0Wa ) that Burch was on a fugitive list and a federal agent was trying to help the deputy arrest him.

The State Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting, which is standard in officer-involved deaths.
