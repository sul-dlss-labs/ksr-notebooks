Members of a Shasta County SWAT team were justified in their shooting of a Happy Valley man in July, the county’s District Attorney’s Office announced today.

Police said John Sebastian Snider, 38, opened fire with a shotgun as seven law enforcement officers approached an apartment during a standoff on July 17 in the 3200 block of Briarwood Drive in Anderson.

Officers returned fire, shooting 88 rounds and killing Snider who was hit at least five times, Redding Police Lt. Jeff Wallace said.

“Snider’s actions left the officers with no choice but to defend themselves and others,” said Assistant District Attorney Josh Lowery. “Therefore, there is no doubt that the officers acted in a manner that was reasonable and justified under California law when they returned fire and killed John Sebastian Snider.”

Surveillance video made available today showed dirt kicking up in front of two SWAT armored vehicles before officers began shooting. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said Snider, who could not be seen in the video, fired three times striking the ground and front of the vehicle before SWAT members returned fire.

Marks from the double-ought buckshot blasted from Snider’s shotgun could be seen on the front of the armored vehicles in police photos from the scene.

The deputies involved were Sgt. James Beaupre, Det. David Eoff, Sgt. Eric Magrini, deputy Cary Erickson, Det. Gene Randall, Det. Nick Thompson and deputy Tom Fleming, according to investigators.

Bosenko said the deputies were placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure following a shooting incident, and have since returned to work.

“The taking of a life is a serious decision and it’s never an option that law enforcement wants to pursue,” Bosenko said. “However there are occasions when officers have no other choice, and this was one of those occasions.”

The firefight escalated from a standoff after Anderson Police responded to reports of a domestic disturbance there about 6:14 a.m. that morning. Officers arrived after the victim, later determined to be Snider’s girlfriend, and a witness fled the apartment.

Snider was alone and refused to come out. Police called in SWAT a short time later and nearby neighbors were evacuated.

Lowery said Thursday the incident was not the first time Snider had assaulted his girlfriend and a restraining order had been issued against him. In the past he had held her at gunpoint, beat her, punched her in the stomach while pregnant and shot and killed two of her dogs, Lowery said.

Snider brandished a handgun while standing in the window of the apartment, later returning with a shotgun and opening fire as the SWAT team approached.

Redding Police Lt. Wallace said Snider used the same handgun to beat his girlfriend before police arrived.

During a search of his car, parked nearby, investigators found two other handguns, some knives, a bullet proof vest and a gas mask, Wallace said.

Snider was a convicted felon and had a $500,000 outstanding warrant for assault with a deadly weapon and making terrorist threats.

An investigation into the shooting was conducted by the Redding Police Department. Bosenko said the Sheriff’s Department also performed an internal investigation.
