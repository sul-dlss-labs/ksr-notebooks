Greene County Sherif Jim Arnott released the identity of a man shot dead by deputies after a pursuit.

Deputies tried to pull William Ray Simcoe, Jr. over at Kansas and Kearney in Springfield on several felony charges. The chase ended on Highway YY near Maple Ridge Lane between Strafford and Rogersville.

Deputies chased Simcoe on foot after he jumped out of his SUV.

The sheriff says Simcoe pulled out a gun and said he had a full clip, that's when deputies shot and killed him.

â€œThe suspect was armed with a .45 caliber handgun and as I said he announced he had a full clip just as he raised it towards the deputies as they fired," said Sheriff Jim Arnott.

Deputies also arrested a woman.

"Greene County Sheriff's Deputies passed by pretty fast and then a couple of fire trucks and EMT's. I would say right after the EMTs passed by there was about four to six gun shots and then it just went completely quiet," said Derek Lyons who lives nearby.

The sheriff's department says Simcoe was wanted for burglary and for parole violation.

The deputies involved are on administrative leave.
