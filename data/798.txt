Jackson County man takes life after chase

Jackson County authorities say a man involved in a short chase took his own life yesterday. Jackson County deputies were trying to serve a warrant on 39-year-old Gary Pickett of Miles. Pickett was wanted on four counts of third-degree sexual abuse. Pickett fled, leading officers on a high-speed chase that ended near Preston. Officers say Pickett pulled out a shotgun, and when they tried to negotiate with him, he took his own life.
