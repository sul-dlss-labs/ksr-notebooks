DECATUR CO., GA (WALB) - The GBI office in Thomasville is investigating a shooting in Decatur County.

Decatur County Sheriff's deputies responded to 998 Yates Spring Road around 1:14 p.m. regarding a reported suicide threat.

Officials said Roger Braswell, 50, who lived at this location, had made the threatening statement in a phone call to a former co-worker.

When deputies arrived, they made attempts to deescalate the situation, but officials said Braswell refused assistance.

Investigators said Braswell made threatening statements to the deputies, and an arrest warrant was obtained for Terroristic Threats.

At 5:25 p.m., deputies said Braswell left his home through the back door and began shooting at two of the officers.

One deputy fired back, forcing Braswell to go back inside of his home.

Deputies entered the home and found Braswell with several wounds to his shoulders, hip, and knee.

Braswell was sent to Bainbridge Memorial Hospital where he later died from his wounds.

An autopsy will be conducted at the GBI Crime Lab.

After the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to the South Georgia District Attorney's Office.

The two Decatur County Sheriff's deputies involved in the shooting have been re-assigned to administrative duties, per the Sheriff's Office's policy .
