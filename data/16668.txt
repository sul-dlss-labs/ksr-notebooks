UPDATE: (Monday, Sept. 21): TBI spokesperson Susan Niland told The Herald on Sunday afternoon the following: "Our team of forensic scientists and special agents remained on the scene in Cumberland Furnace, collecting evidence and interviewing witnesses, until just before midnight on Friday. As with any similar investigation, the next days and weeks will involve continuing to interview relevant witnesses and forensically examine the evidence that was collected while awaiting results from the autopsy. We can't speak to specifics of evidence we collect in an active investigation, so I can't speak as to whether videotape was included as part of the evidence collected."

UPDATE (5:10 p.m.): TBI released the name of the deceased man, Gregory Herrell, age 47.

UPDATE (3:17 p.m.): A Cumberland Furnace man was fatally shot during an "interaction" with a Dickson County Sheriff's Office deputy late Friday morning, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

About 10:50 a.m., two deputies arrived at a residence on Freeman Loop Road in north Dickson County after receiving a call 20 minutes earlier asking for a welfare check on the man who lived there, said TBI spokesperson Susan Niland.

"During an interaction with that individual, one of the deputies discharged a weapon," Niland said. "We don't' know at this point what precipitated that. That is going to be part of our investigation."

"The individual was transported to the hospital and was pronounced dead upon arrival," Niland added.

Niland said at about 2:30 p.m. TBI agents were awaiting the arrival of the TBI violent crimes response team.

The TBI is not releasing the man's name at this time until relatives can be notified.

The investigation is ongoing.
