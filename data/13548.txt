The city of Memphis has reached a settlement with the children of a man who died during a botched police standoff in 2013.

The city agreed to settle the case for $185,000, which also covered attorneys' fees, court costs and funeral expenses. The balance of $114,278.52 will be divided among the three minor children of Aaron Dumas, city attorney Bruce McMullen said Thursday. Of that amount, $3,000 will be paid up front, McMullen said, with the remainder deposited into an interest-bearing account.

This follows a payout of $587,000 earlier this year in the death of Steven Askew, who was shot and killed in 2013 by Memphis Police Department officers Matthew Dyess and Ned Aufdenkamp.

Dumas, 32, died on Oct. 15, 2013 in a home at 1382 Worthington in South Memphis. Dumas had been wanted in connection with the attempted murder of his ex-girlfriend, and had holed up in that home. When MPD's TACT team arrived, they began a standoff that culminated with the house burning down, Dumas dying of smoke inhalation and two officers suffering from bullet wounds.

MPD conducted an internal review that concluded that the TACT team severely bungled the incident. The commander of the team and two lieutenants were reassigned while the unit itself was sidelined for more than two months during the review. A total of 10 officers were brought up on departmental charges for their actions during the incident. Five of those saw the charges dismissed while the other five were suspended for a total of 97 days.

The review concluded that the TACT team made a number of errors that day, including:

* Firing at least three flammable tear gas canisters into the house that were meant for outdoor use only. A TACT officer also threw into the house a smoke grenade that was only to be used outdoors.



* Using too much tear gas for a 1,900-square-foot house. Officers fired or threw at least 15 canisters into the home; a lieutenant said the normal deployment would have been three to four. Police conceded there is a formula for how much gas to use, but that itâ€™s so complicated they rarely do the math.



* Suffering a near-complete breakdown in their ability to communicate with the suspect.



* Entering the home without their full tactical gear, in part because of contradictory protocols.

Both officers who were shot that day recovered.
