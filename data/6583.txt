PIGGOTT, AR - Arkansas State Police troopers are investigating the death of a man shot last night by two Piggott police officers.

Police say Tommy Joe Rogers of Piggott repeatedly rammed his car into another parked along a street in the Clay County town. Officials say Rogers left and returned a short time later and began running into the car again as part of a domestic dispute.

Arkansas State Police Lt Rick Dickinson said two Piggott police officers arrived and found Rogers still in his car. Dickinson says Rogers got out of the car with a "long gun" and pointed it at the officers, who fired at him.

Arkansas troopers normally investigate police shootings throughout the state. The names of the officers involved were not immediately released, and Piggott police declined to comment on the matter. Both officers are on paid suspensions.
