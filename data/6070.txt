DECATUR - Decatur police shot and killed a suspected bank robber Wednesday and arrested a man they believe was an accomplice, according to the FBI.

A third suspect remained at large Wednesday evening, the FBI said in a news release.

Police identified the dead man as Jerrell L. Chism, 27, of Decatur.

Three robbers armed with handguns walked into the Soy Capital Bank about 8:50 a.m. and demanded cash, according to the FBI. They fired shots while inside but no one was injured.

The robbers drove away from the bank with an unspecified amount of money, the FBI said. The vehicle was stopped by Decatur police not far away.

One suspect jumped from the vehicle and ran away just before the traffic stop, the FBI said. Two others ran away from the car after it stopped and one exchanged shots with police.

Officers shot Chism, who died later at St. Mary's Hospital in Decatur, according to the FBI. No police were injured. Another man was arrested and was being held at the Macon County Jail, FBI Agent John Parrish said.

The shootout happened near Johns Hill Magnet School, which was temporarily locked down and police searched for the third suspect.

Area residents who heard gunshots said they waved for children outside the school to get inside.

"We started screaming for the kids to 'get down' 'get down' and to get into the school," Jessie Lucas told the Decatur Herald & Review.
