COLUMBUS, GA (WTVM) - Authorities are investigating an officer involved shooting that killed a Columbus man armed with a BB gun late Wednesday night, Nov. 13.

Willie James Williams died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds inflicted by a police officer who responded to an attempted armed robbery call on Fort Benning Rd.

The officer approached two men who fit the description of the subjects near Shelby St.

Genard Johnson was one of the men who reported to police that he was in the process of being robbed by Williams. Johnson complied with the officer's commands.

However, Williams refused to drop his weapon, a BB gun which resembled a .45 caliber pistol. Williams raised his gun and the officer fired at him, striking him multiple times.

"The officer kept telling that man (Williams) to drop his gun," Johnson explained. "Instead of following orders, the man kept holding the gun at the officer."

Johnson said he had never met Williams. Williams reached into Johnson's pockets to take his cellphone, wallet, keys and other few items. Columbus Police arrived at the area of the incident shortly after Williams approached Johnson.

"I had my hands on the officer's vehicle because he told me to," Johnson said. "I watched the officer fire shots at the man, and I saw him fall. He was covered in blood, and there were bullet shells everywhere."

Williams was taken to the Medical Center with a gunshot wound and remained in critical condition. He was pronounced dead at Midtown Medical Center on Thursday, Nov. 14.

The officer has been placed on administrative leave with pay as the incident is being investigated by both the GBI and the Columbus Police Department, which is standard procedure.

No officers or witnesses were injured by the suspect.
