The San Diego Police Department on Monday released the names of a man killed in front of a Mission Valley pharmacy and the officer who shot him.

Just after midnight Friday, SDPD officers were called at the CVS Pharmacy at Friars and Mission Center roads for a report of a man wielding a box cutter, yelling and chasing an employee.

Officer Eric Oberndorfer, 15-year veteran of the SDPD, arrived at the scene, and officials say he saw a person who matched the suspect’s description, standing outside the store with a box cutter in his hand.

As he got out of his patrol car, Oberndorfer gave the man — identified as 54-year-old Robert Arthur Hober of San Diego — verbal commands, according to the SDPD. Hober ignored them.

The officer told investigators Hober quickly advanced while pointing the blade toward him. Oberndorfer moved to the rear of his vehicle to create distance and continued to tell Hober to put the box cutter down.

The SDPD says Hober advanced again, so Oberndorfer fired his weapon at the suspect.

Hober died at the scene. According to officials, Oberndorfer was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting.

If you have any information about this case, you are asked to call the homicide unit at 619-531-2293 or Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477.
