GEORGETOWN, Texas (KXAN) – Two Georgetown police officers have been cleared of any wrong doing in a shooting in October that left two people dead.

On Thursday, a Williamson County grand jury determined that Sgt. Bill Pascoe and Sgt. Dale Duncan were justified in using deadly force against 52-year-old Anthony Blackmon.

On October 31 , just before 10 p.m., officers responded to a domestic disturbance call in the 200 block of Tamara Drive.

When they got to the house, Pascoe, Duncan and a third officer found four children inside the home who said their mother, Terry Pittman, 38, was in danger and that she was in her bedroom with her boyfriend and the door was locked.

According to Georgetown PD, the officers announced themselves and ordered Mr. Blackmon to open the door. The officers then entered the room by force and immediately saw Blackmon and Pittman on the floor fighting. Officers said thatâ€™s when Blackmon pulled away from Pittman and started firing a gun at her.

Once they saw Blackmon fire shots, Pascoe grabbed his weapon and fired at Blackmon while Duncan tried to protect Pittman in an effort to save her.

According to the police press release, Duncan returned gunfire at Mr. Blackmon, who was now pointing his weapon at Duncan, until Blackmon dropped his weapon.

Pittman died at the scene, Blackmon died at the hospital.

The Georgetown Police Department and the Texas Rangers were involved in the investigation to determine if the officers responded appropriately.

“The Georgetown Police Department responded extraordinarily quickly and appropriately to a very dangerous situation,” said Williamson County District Attorney John Bradley. “They protected four children and put themselves in harm’s way to try to protect a woman from domestic violence.â€
