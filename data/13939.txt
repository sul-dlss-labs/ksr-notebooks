An autopsy has found that a man who police had said was shot and killed by officers during an East Baltimore traffic stop had in fact fired the fatal bullet himself, a police spokesman confirmed.

Police said on Jan. 13 that officers pulled over a vehicle in the 1800 block of E. Lanvale St., and saw a gun in the hand of a man in the car. Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriguez told reporters at the scene that both officers fired at the man, later identified as 24-year-old Perry Webb, and Rodriguez said was found a gun was found in Webb's hand.

But an autopsy determined that the bullet that struck Webb in the head and caused his death was fired from the weapon that was in Webb's hand, police spokesman Lt. Eric Kowalczyk said in response to questions from The Sun.

Webb was hit by at least one bullet fired by the officers, in the abdomen area. Kowalczyk said the investigation is continuing.

"Any crime scene is complicated and dynamic, and it takes time to go through the evidence that's there, and take a look at exactly what happened," Kowalczyk said. "That's what happened in this case. As the investigation unfolded, they were able to make that determination."
