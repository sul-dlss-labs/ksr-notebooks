SAN ANTONIO â€“ An armed man was shot and killed by a federal agent early Tuesday morning on the city's Southwest Side, FBI officials said.

FBI Special Agent Christopher Combs said that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Removal Operations agents were serving a warrant on a man around 7 a.m. near the intersection of Vermont and Ferndale avenues, when the man ran and fired at officers.

Agents returned fire, killing the man, Combs said. One of the agents suffered minor injuries.

While federal agents and San Antonio police filled portions of Vermont Avenue, residents like Gabby Ledesma wondered what was going on.

"Just woke up to hearing gunshots, and we saw officers and a man laying down on the floor," she said. "It was probably six to 10 gunshots we heard."

An ICE official released the following statement regarding the shooting:

"On May 1, 2018, ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) personnel were involved in an officer-related shooting. ICE can confirm the subject is deceased and that a firearm was recovered from the scene. Per agency protocol, ICE's Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR) is reviewing the incident. The agency has no further comment at this time."
