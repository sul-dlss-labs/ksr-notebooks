BURLINGTON CITY â€” A man who reportedly shot at a police officer last night was killed when the officer returned fire.

According to a preliminary investigation, the officer was on patrol just before midnight when he stopped and tried to talk with a suspicious man walking near a car dealership in the 1200 block of Route 130 South near the border with Burlington Township, authorities said.

The man fled on foot and the officer went after him, said authorities. The foot chase went into an overgrown lot near the car dealership, where the man allegedly fired a shot at the officer. The patrolman, who was not hit, returned fire and fatally wounded the man, authorities said.

The man's gun was recovered, but his identity has not been confirmed, said authorities.

The officer, whose name has not been released, was evaluated at a hospital and released. He will be on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by Burlington City detectives, the Burlington Township police department and the Burlington County Prosecutor's Office.

As mandated by the New Jersey Attorney General's guidelines, the BCPO will review the investigation once it's completed to determine if the officer's use of force was appropriate, authorities said.
