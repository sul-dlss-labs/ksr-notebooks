SAGINAW, MI -- A 31-year-old Saginaw man is dead after he crashed a car into a tree, splitting the vehicle in half.

About 11:15 p.m. on Wednesday, March 15, Michigan State Police troopers were traveling north on Douglass Street in Saginaw when they observed a 2003 Cadillac CTS far ahead of them with a defective brake light, Special 1st Lt. David Kaiser said. The Cadillac turned east onto Hess Avenue and troopers followed at a distance, without activating their overhead lights or sirens.

The troopers also turned east onto Hess, but lost sight of the Cadillac, which had apparently taken off at a high speed. On approaching Russell Street, they looked both directions before seeing faint taillights in the distance to the south, Kaiser said.

The troopers turned south onto Russell, but encountered heavy snow and ice, and were unable to safely accelerate, Kaiser said. They saw a hefty amount of snow blowing up from the Cadillac far ahead of them, followed by a large flash, the lieutenant said.

Making their way down Russell, they found the Cadillac had gone off the west side of the road and struck a tree near the intersection with Nimons Street. The Cadillac was split into two main pieces, one of which was on fire, Kaiser said.

Troopers approached the Cadillac in an attempt to find its occupants, only to find there was no one in either section. They then spotted the driver, Stephenson D. Brown, lying in the road about 40 feet from the wreckage, Kaiser said.

Brown bore several obvious injuries, was not breathing, and had no heartbeat, Kaiser said. Troopers administered CPR, but responding medical personnel pronounced Brown dead at the scene.

Brown was the only occupant of the car.

"We don't know why he was speeding," Kaiser said. "We do know now he did not have a valid driver's license."

Kaiser stated there was no chase, as troopers did not activate their overhead lights until they approached the wreck.

The investigation is ongoing.
