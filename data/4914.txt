The police fatally shot a 24-year-old Bronx man yesterday after officers burst into an apartment where he slashed and attacked four members of his family, the police said.

The shooting took place at 4:42 p.m. in a first-floor apartment at 520 East 137 Street, in the Mill Brook housing project in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. The police said officers arrived at the apartment and found Michael Harris wielding a knife before they shot him. Few details were available last night and the police said investigators had not spoken to the officers.

Mr. Harris was pronounced dead at the scene. The four family members whom he attacked were taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, the police said. A knife, a box cutter and a hammer were recovered at the scene, the police said.

Mr. Harris's victims included his 49-year-old mother, his 21-year-old sister, her 18-month-old son and the boy's 23-year-old father, the police said. The child had been stabbed in the chin, and the baby's parents suffered cuts to their faces and hands. Mr. Harris's mother, identified by neighbors as Charlene Harris, had suffered head injuries.
