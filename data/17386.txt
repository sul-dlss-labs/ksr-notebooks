- Authorities have released the name of a man who was shot and killed at a gas station in southern Pueblo County after state troopers say he accelerated toward them in a stolen vehicle.

Pueblo County Coroner Brian Cotter identified the man Monday as 23-year-old German Gustavo Anchondo Gonzalez. The Pueblo Chieftain reports Cotter did not know if Gonzalez had a permanent address, but his next of kin live in Santa Fe, New Mexico.

The Colorado Bureau of Investigation says troopers pulled Gonzalez and his female passenger over near a gas station in Colorado City on Thursday night. Troopers say Gonzalez then fled on foot, stole a nearby vehicle and accelerated toward them.

The two troopers who were involved in the shooting have been placed on paid administrative leave.
