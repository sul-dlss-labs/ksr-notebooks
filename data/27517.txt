A man fatally shot a woman, who was a passenger in his truck, and then himself during a traffic stop by a state trooper Sunday in Kingman, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said.

A DPS trooper stopped Kyle Don Axtell, 57, and Kelly Susanne Nickolson, 50, just before 2 p.m. in a pickup truck at Gordon and Prairie View drives off of State Route 66, DPS spokesman Martin Sotelo said.

Axtell, the driver, and Nickolson were discovered to have felony warrants "with nationwide extradition" for illegal drugs out of Colorado, Sotelo said.

When the trooper returned to the pickup truck, Axtell showed a handgun and shot Nickolson, Sotelo said.

As the trooper drew and fired his weapon to stop "the deadly threat," Axtell at the same time turned the gun on himself and fired, Sotelo said.

Both Axtell and Nickolson were pronounced dead at the scene, according to Sotelo. DPS described the incident as a murder-suicide.

Axtel lived in Kingman, Sotelo said. It's not yet known where Nickolson lived, he said.

The trooper was not injured in the incident, according to Sotelo.
