(Florence-AP) December 20, 2005 - A Florence man is dead after being shot with a Taser during an arrest. A news release from the Florence County Sheriff's Department says Howard Starr of Florence died after he experienced physical distress during an arrest.

Two deputies have been placed on paid leave following the incident last weekend.

Authorities say they chased Starr and another man who were suspected of using a stolen van to bust into a Darlington County convenience store during a burglary. Florence County deputies spotted the van, which rammed their patrol car.

The driver of the van was shot with a Taser and arrested, then two deputies chased Starr.

The sheriff's department declined to reveal how many times the Taser was used during the incident.

Officials with the State Law Enforcement Division are investigating Starr's death but refused to comment further. The incident comes five months after the Taser-related death of a South Carolina inmate.
