The man killed Saturday by Hopewell sheriff's deputies was an Army soldier from Fort Bragg, N.C.

The suspect was identified Sunday as Robert L. Henderson III, 21, according to Virginia State Police Sgt. Thomas J. Molnar.

Henderson was assigned to the Army's 82nd Airborne Division, according to Staff Sgt. Joshua Ford, an Army spokesman at Fort Bragg.

Further details about Henderson and his military service were not yet available, Ford said Sunday.

Deputies with the Hopewell Sheriff's Office fatally shot Henderson on Saturday morning on southbound Interstate 295 in Prince George County when he opened fire on officers after speeding away from a traffic stop, state police said.

Molnar said Henderson, driving a 2000 Nissan Altima, was pulled over shortly after 10 a.m. Saturday for reckless driving, allegedly driving more than 100 mph.

As a deputy approached his vehicle at the 11-mile marker, Henderson drove off. The officer and a second Hopewell deputy pursued him in two vehicles and, after driving 2 miles, Henderson stopped in the right-hand lane of the highway near the 9-mile marker, according to state police.

Police said he got out of his car and confronted the deputies, who were parked in the left-hand lane of southbound I-295.

Henderson shot at the deputies, who shot back and hit him. He was flown to VCU Medical Center, where he died.

State police did not provide the names of the Hopewell deputies, who were not hit in the shooting.
