FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. â€” Two women who survived a fiery crash are now charged with armed robbery and car theft.

Authorities arrested Adriean Bynum, 23, and Latoya Walton, 21, both of Fayetteville, in connection with the accident.

Shortly before 10 p.m. on Friday, a Honda Passport was seen leaving a Burger King that had been robbed, police said. Authorities said the two women were inside the vehicle, which was stolen, with three other people when it led Fayetteville police on a chase through town at speeds of 90 mph.

Police said they called off the chase just before the SUV plowed through a telephone pole, slammed into a building and caught on fire. Three people died and Walton was taken to a local hospital for injuries. Bynum, authorities said, ran from the scene.

The two women were taken into custody early Saturday evening.

Bynum is charged with robbery with a deadly weapon, conspiracy with threat of robbery with deadly weapon, felony/larceny with a motor vehicle. She is in the Cumberland County Detention Center under $80,000 bond.

Walton faces the same charges as Bynum, as well as possession of stolen goods. She is in the Cumberland County Detention Center under $85,000 bond.
