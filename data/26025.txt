A man who was exposing himself and waving a gun on Mississippi 13 near Lumberton's City Hall Tuesday is dead, authorities say.

The incident is being treated as an officer-involved shooting, said Lamar County Sheriff Danny Rigel, though the man, he said, shot himself.

Rigel said his office got several calls early Tuesday morning about a man exposing himself near Lumberton City Hall.

"He was waving a gun," Rigel said of the incident that happened around 8 a.m. "When Lumberton police got there, he ran to the back of City Hall and and pointed a gun at the officer.

"The officer fired one round and the suspect shot himself in the chest and died at the scene."

Sheriff's officials, the Lamar County district attorney's office and the Hattiesburg police crime scene unit are investigating. The officer has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

Lamar County Coroner Cody Creel said identification of the man is being held pending notification of relatives and until he gets permission from the sheriff's office to release it.

The body is being sent to the state Crime Lab in Jackson for autopsy.
