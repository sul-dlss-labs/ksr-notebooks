A man shot by Jacksonville police Saturday when he charged them armed with a machete-like knife and a dagger has died.

Cody Nathanael Marsh, 19, died about 10 p.m. Sunday, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Marsh, of Orange Park, was swinging the knives wildly as he was shot in the head and arm about 3:30 a.m. after Officers James White and Johnathan Cochran opened fire.

In a Facebook post by a person identifying himself as Marsh, the author wrote a goodbye note giving away a guitar and telling friends he loved them. The post also had harsh works for people identified as his parents.

"To all my friends this is goodbye," the post said. "This is the end for me. I love you all."

The post ends with, "Goodbye."

The Facebook page has since been taken down.

Police said Marsh ran at the officers while threatening to cut their heads off near the McDonald's restaurant at East State and North Market streets downtown.

He was carrying several other knives, police said and was taken in critical condition to UF Health Jacksonville. Neither White nor Cochran was injured, Butler said.

White fired three shots, while Cochran fired once, police said.

Marsh had been entered into a mental health treatment facility under the Baker Act for making suicide threats last October. In 2014 Marsh was arrested in Clay County for bringing an Airsoft gun into a school.

Police said a family member left Marsh at a Jacksonville shelter Saturday because he had said he had taken drugs and the family member didn't know what else to do.
