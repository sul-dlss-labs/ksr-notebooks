Starting Sunday, the Strawbery Banke Museum on Marcy Street will open the latch on its gate to Portsmouth residents for free as part of a new program called Sundays on the Banke.

Become whoever you want to be this weekend - art appreciator, music fanatic, activist, environmentalist, church supper connoisseur, bargain detective ... or all of the above. Just don't be boring.

The annual Dover Pride Clean-Up Day is scheduled for Saturday, May 8. Registration will begin at 7 a.m. in the Cocheco Mill courtyard and all volunteers are asked to register on the day of the event. Volunteers are still needed for painting, cleaning, raking, weeding, planting and other projects.
