MANITOWOC - The Manitowoc County District Attorney’s Office has determined there was no “criminal wrongdoing” by Manitowoc County Sheriff's Deputy Eric Roehl in the Dec. 22, 2019, death of Forest Springstube.

According to an April 9 letter from District Attorney Jacalyn LaBre to the Wisconsin Department of Justice, a review of evidence by her office “concludes that Deputy Roehl acted appropriately and that there is no probable cause to believe that Deputy Roehl committed any criminal offence.”

Roehl had attempted to stop a vehicle driven by Springstube on Dec. 22, 2019, at approximately 2:55 a.m. Springstube, 23 and a Two Rivers resident, was traveling at 90 miles per hour on Interstate 43 and then turned onto State 310 headed toward Two Rivers. When Roehl turned on the sirens and emergency lights on his patrol car to attempt a traffic stop, Springstube tried to flee, accelerating at speeds of more than 100 miles per hour.

Roehl tried to catch up to the vehicle, and after driving through a curve in the road, found it had crashed into a utility pole. Roehl found Springstube inside the vehicle and requested emergency services. Springstube was determined to be dead at the scene.

According to the letter from LaBre, Roehl “acted in a manner consistent with the law and consistent with his training as a law enforcement officer.
