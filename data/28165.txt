A Ville Platte man was killed and another was injured after a high speed pursuit early Saturday morning.

Shortly before 1:30 a.m., a Louisiana State Police Trooper attempted to conduct a traffic stop on a vehicle for a traffic violation. The driver, identified as 31-year-old Makenzie Dixon, initially pulled over on the shoulder, then drove away, leading to a pursuit.

While traveling at a high rate of speed on LA Hwy 10 near LA Hwy 106, Dixon failed to negotiate a curve and lost control of the vehicle. The vehicle traveled off the roadway, partially overturned, and hit a tree.

The passenger, 33-year-old Kevin Arvie, was unrestrained in the front passenger seat and sustained fatal injuries in the crash. Arvie was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Dixon was unrestrained and was transported to a local hospital with moderate injuries.

A toxicology sample was obtained and will be submitted for analysis. The crash remains under investigation and charges are pending.

Wearing a seat belt is the simplest and most effective step motorists can take to reduce the risk of injury in the event of a crash. Louisiana state law requires motor vehicle occupants to be properly restrained in all seating positions, day and night. Motorists are encouraged to make the smart choice and wear a seat belt on every trip.

In 2020, Troop I has investigated 20 fatal crashes resulting in 23 deaths.
