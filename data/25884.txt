The man shot dead by Indio police on Wednesday has been identified as a 21-year-old Thermal resident, Riverside County sheriff's officials said Friday.

Deputies said Anthony Santana was shot following a strong-arm robbery outside a Subway sandwich shop in Indio.

The suspect was armed with a gun, Indio police spokesman Ben Guitron said at the time.

Sheriff's officials said the next day that members of their central homicide unit had taken over the investigation. They said anyone with information about the case could call (760) 393-3500 or (951) 955-2777.

Guitron said after the shooting that the man now identified as Santana had robbed a man's cell phone about an hour before he was shot.

It was unclear how many rounds were fired at Santana. He was shot at his apartment complex in the 81-800 block of Las Palmas Road.

Police arrived at the complex after someone reported the suspect acting suspiciously in the common area. The officers confronted the armed man and a shooting ensued, Guitron said.

The officer or officers involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave.

Sheriff's officials said Friday no further information was being released in the case.
