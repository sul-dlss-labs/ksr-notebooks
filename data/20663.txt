A 24-year-old Palmerton, Pa., man was killed when he flipped his car after fleeing from police early this morning, authorities said.

Slatington police had attempted to pull James J. Diehl over at 3 o'clock at the intersection of Main and South Second streets in the borough, according to state police at Bethlehem. Diehl didn’t stop for police and instead took off east on Main Street at a high rate of speed, police said.

Diehl crossed into Walnutport and lost control of his car at 238 Main St. in town, flipping his car and striking the house’s porch, police said. Diehl died from injuries sustained from hitting the concrete porch, police said.
