A 32-year-old fugitive is dead following an exchange of gunfire with Polk County detectives Wednesday in Lakeland, authorities said. Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd says Francis Perry died at a hospital in Lakeland on Thursday morning, hours after officers with a multi-agency drug task force pulled him over. The sheriff says Perry refused to roll down his dark-tinted car windows, so a detective finally smashed a passenger window. Judd says that's when Perry fired at them with a handgun, and all four detectives fired back, at least 28 times. The officers performed CPR until medics arrived and took Perry to the hospital.Records show Perry was arrested 20 times in as many years, starting with a shoplifting charge when he was 10. He served three stints in prison, and was a self-declared white supremacist. Judd says the detectives found thousands of dollars worth of methamphetamines in the car.
