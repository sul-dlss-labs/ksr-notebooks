State authorities are investigating a shooting by a Sullivan County Sheriff's Office deputy that left a 32-year-old man dead on Monday afternoon.

Just before 1:30 p.m., Sullivan County deputies went to a home on Pennsylvania Road in Kingsport to arrest Terry Frost on unspecified arrest warrants, according to a news release from the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

Frost ran from the home and was spotted getting into an SUV, driven by a woman, on Diana Avenue. Deputies stopped the SUV and ordered the driver out of the vehicle.

"At that point, Frost jumped into the driverâ€™s seat," the release reads. "As one of the deputies attempted to pull Frost from the SUV, he accelerated, dragging the deputy alongside the vehicle. The deputy fired shots at Frost, striking him."

The SUV continued onward before coming to a stop in the 2000 block of Diana Avenue.

Frost was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The deputy also was taken to a local hospital. The severity of the deputy's injuries was not immediately clear Monday.

The TBI is not identifying the deputy involved, in accordance with the agency's policy.

The investigation is ongoing.
