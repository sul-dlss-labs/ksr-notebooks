Police shot and killed a man about 5:05 p.m. Tuesday in the 3600 block of MacGregor Drive - just off Wilson Boulevard on Jacksonville's Westside - after he called police and threatened to kill himself and others, according to the Sheriff's Office.

Chief Adam Brown said the unidentified man told emergency dispatch he had handguns and rifles at his residence.

"He also said to send the SWAT team, 'I want to be killed,' " Brown said.

When officers arrived, the man came outside, saw the police and went back inside and armed himself with a handgun, Brown said.

He reemerged from the house with a weapon in his hand and officers commanded him to drop it, Brown said. When he raised the gun toward police, two officers fired AR-15 rifles, hitting the suspect, who died at the scene.

Sgt. Tony Batrous, a 12-year veteran of the Sheriff's Office, fired five rounds. Officer Kenon Samuel, a four-year veteran, fired twice. It is Batrous' second police-involved shooting and Samuel's first, Brown said.

Brown did not immediately know if the suspect had fired his weapon but he said officers doing a preliminary search of his residence found an assault-type SKS rifle, as well as a handgun. It was unknown if the SKS rifle was fully automatic.

This is the seventh police-involved shooting in Jacksonville so far this year, equalling the total for 2013. Four shootings this year have resulted in suspects' deaths. There were five fatal shootings of suspects in 2013.
