MERRIMAC (CBS) -- A man who led police on a chase from Merrimac to Haverhill Saturday before crashing into a telephone pole has died, Merrimac Police said Sunday morning.

Merrimac Chief Eric Shears said an officer stopped the man's car on West Main Street around 4 p.m. for allegedly driving with expired registration, but he took off when the officer approached.

Police said he drove onto Route 110 in the direction of Haverhill. The officer wasn't able to catch up --but when he came around a bend on Atwood Road, he saw that the driver had smashed into a pole.

"This is obviously an unfortunate outcome," Chief Shears said in a statement. "We are actively investigating and hope to learn more about the circumstances surrounding this incident as soon as possible."

Police are still investigating the chase and crash.
