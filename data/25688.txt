On Friday, APD identified the man as 23-year-old Dylan Aikey.

In a press conference March 7, APD Chief Justin Doll said the shooting happened around 2:15 a.m. after police responded to a call about a “prowler” going through a vehicle on the 1900 block of Columbine Street. The caller reportedly scared the person away before calling police, Doll said. When responding officers arrived, they found a man they believed to be the suspect nearby, Doll said. Police said they ordered the man — later identified as Aikey — to stop. He fled, and officers pursued him on foot, according to APD.

“We believe, at this point, that that suspect fired at our officers, and our officers returned fire,” Doll said.

Doll said officers recovered a handgun with a partially ejected shell casing at the scene. Four officers fired at Aikey, who was hit multiple times, Doll said. Officers rendered aid and called for medics, but Aikey was later declared deceased at a local hospital around 2:45 a.m., according to APD.

The police chief said the case remains under investigation, and the four officers involved have been placed on mandatory administrative leave. After withholding their names for 72 hours, per department protocol, police on March 10 identified the officers as Ofc. Steven Amnatkeolee, a member of APD for 4 years; Ofc. Brandon Schafer, member of APD for 8 months; Ofc. Kyle Haskins, a member of APD for 2 years and Ofc. Matthew Choate, a member of APD for 1 year.

After APD completes its own investigation, the police chief said, the case would be forwarded to the the Office of Special Prosecution for a review. Chief Doll said the department’s internal affairs department would also review the case.
