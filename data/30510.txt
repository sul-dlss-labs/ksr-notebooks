HUNTINGTOWN — A man died while in the custody of deputies in Southern Maryland, authorities said.

Calvert County deputies responded to “a suspicious person breaking windows” Saturday afternoon in the 2100 block of Lowery Road, according to a news release from the sheriff’s office. They arrested Antoine Brooks of Huntingtown.

The 31-year-old was taken to a shaded area where he waited to be transported. Force wasn’t used during the arrest, the sheriff’s office said. A preliminary investigation found that Brooks admitted to consuming a controlled dangerous substance while he was handcuffed.

Deputies noticed “his breathing getting shallow and pulse getting faint” moments later, according to the news release. They administered Narcan, a device that delivers the opioid-overdose antidote naloxone; used an automated external defibrillator and performed CPR while they waited for an ambulance.

Brooks was pronounced dead at a hospital. His body was transported to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore for an autopsy. The cause of and manner of his death, as well as toxicology results, are pending.

The Maryland State Police homicide unit is investigating. Body camera footage is expected to be reviewed with his family on Monday morning and will be released afterward, the sheriff’s office said.
