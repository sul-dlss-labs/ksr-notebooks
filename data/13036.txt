HAYWARD — A 33-year-old man who died while in police custody Monday night has been identified as Willie Joseph Evans III of Hayward, police said.

A spokesman from the Alameda County Coroner’s office said Hayward police have a hold on what information can be released, including the man’s cause of death. Police investigators were not immediately available Wednesday night.

Police said Evans had caused an unspecified disturbance about 10:55 p.m. Monday at the McDonald’s Restaurant at 23989 Watkins St. and when officers arrived they found him in front of the eatery.

When police ran his name and discovered he had an outstanding warrant, he was arrested, said Hayward police Sgt. Eric Melendez said. Police have declined to say why Evans had the warrant.

While in custody at the Hayward Police Department, Evans had a “medical emergency” while struggling with jail staff, police said.

Evans collapsed in the jail, and staff and paramedics were not able to resuscitate him, Melendez said. He was taken to Saint Rose Hospital in Hayward, where he was pronounced dead, Melendez said.

Anyone who has information about this incident should call Hayward police at 510-293-7000.
