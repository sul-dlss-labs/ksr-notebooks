SPRING CREEK – A domestic dispute turned deadly Thursday night at a home in Spring Creek when a man reportedly shot his wife and was then shot by law enforcement officers.

Elko County Sheriff Jim Pitts said deputies were called to the home on Spring Creek Parkway at about 8:45 p.m. Pitts said the wife’s sister let officers in the house, and they heard arguing in a bedroom.

When officers opened the door, the husband shot the wife and officers shot the husband, identified as Jared S.R. Williams, 31.

Karen Williams, 33, was estranged from her husband and had recently moved into the home, according to Pitts.

The couple had three children together. They and a fourth from the wife’s previous marriage were in the home at the time of the incident, and have been placed in the care of their aunt.

Pitts said Jared Williams worked for an express delivery service.

Washoe Crime Lab from Reno was processing the crime scene and the OIS (Officer Involved Shooting) team from Carson City is investigating. The Lander County Sheriff’s office is serving as coroner.

Pitts said further details about the shootings will be released after investigation.
