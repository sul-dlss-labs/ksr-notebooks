A murder suspect was fatally shot by police in Brooklyn after he allegedly tried to drive off with a cop hanging onto his car, authorities said yesterday. Officers Suzanne Johnson and Matthew Menze of the 75th Precinct spotted the suspect's car Monday night in a White Castle parking lot on Pennsylvania Ave. in East New York. They recognized the Ohio license plate - SATADAY - as the street name for Shannon Vinson, 28, who was wanted in a homicide. The cops followed the red Ford Probe from the parking lot and pulled Vinson over on Stanley Ave. He refused to get out of the car and reached for a handgun on the floor, police said. The car began moving, and Johnson reached inside trying to pull the key out of the ignition. She was dragged for about a block. But she and her partner fired a total of seven shots, hitting Vinson multiple times. His girlfriend and her two children, sitting in the back seat, were not injured. Vinson was pronounced dead at Brookdale University Hospital. A loaded 9-mm. handgun was found on the floor of the car. It is the same caliber weapon used to shoot Jeffrey Pena three times Aug. 15 as he sat in his car on Dumont Ave. Police said Vinson had broken Pena's jaw two years ago in a fight, and they had been feuding ever since. Pena, 24, gave cops his killer's nickname before he died from his wounds last month.
