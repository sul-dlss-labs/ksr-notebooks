Investigators are awaiting autopsy and toxicology reports to determine what killed a man who struggled with the State Police on the New Jersey Turnpike, authorities said today.



The Attorney General's Shooting Response Team is investigating the death late Sunday of Robert Tuite Jr., 34, of Patchogue, N.Y.

Tuite's vehicle was stopped in the highway's left lane in Teaneck about 11 p.m. when a trooper found him unresponsive inside, authorities said. After the trooper woke him up and had him move his car off the roadway, backup troopers arrived and gave Tuite a sobriety test, according to the Attorney General's office.The police tried to arrest the man for driving while intoxicated, but he resisted. Tuite had to be physically restrained and put in handcuffs, authorities said. Tuite then experienced an unknown medical problem, and the troopers administered first aid before he was taken to Englewood Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, authorities said.



An autopsy will be performed as early as today, but results will be kept confidential pending the outcome of the investigation, said Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office. The toxicology tests will also take several weeks, he said.



Aseltine declined to comment on Tuite's past medical history. The response team is interviewing those involved, Aseltine said, but declined to provide specifics on the investigation.



The three troopers suffered cuts and scrapes but did not require medical attention, he said.



State Police spokesman Sgt. Julian Castellanos declined to comment today, referring all questions to the Attorney General's office. The shooting response team is called to investigate shootings and other incidents involving the New Jersey State Police.
