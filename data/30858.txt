A man was killed and a D.C. police officer was shot during an altercation in Northwest D.C. Tuesday evening.

D.C. police said the shooting occurred near the intersection of V and 14th streets at around 8 p.m.

Police Chief Robert Contee said police were called after a report of a person with a long gun on a balcony.

Officers spoke with the person several times, and the last time the person emerged from the apartment, he was carrying a long gun, Contee said in a news conference Tuesday night.

At least one officer fired his weapon. The person was shot and taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead. An officer was also shot but Contee said he suffered a minor injury.

On whether the weapon may have been an air rifle, Contee said it appears it’s possible. He referred to the photo police posted on social media, saying that’s not the condition that was displayed to the officers.

“This weapon looks very real,” Contee said, adding that the weapon’s purpose will be determined during its examination.

Contee also said they don’t yet know which weapon struck the officer who was shot. He added that the department will work “around the clock” to have the police body camera footage of the incident available to the public as soon as possible.
