Behind a red ribbon lies a story of hope, integriity and a loving legacy left behind by George Temple the II.

Temple was alledgely shot to death by a bystander last February while fighting with a Baton Rouge police officer. Reports from the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Department indicate an officer also shot Temple.

The scuffle happened after Temple allegely cut into a funeral procession. At the time the 20-year old Southern University business entrepenuear was working on remodeling his store "Expert Sound."

Candace Temple knew how important her brother's shop was to him, "The same week my brother was killed, he told me if something ever happens to me, i want my business to keep going."

And that is exactly what the Temple family did. His sister Candace followed her brother's plans. From the checkered floors on the inside to the installation booths that line the walls , and even Temple's Mercedes that sits on the showroom floor , Temple's dream lives on, "It's been very hard without my brother mentally but he trained me from day one and he's always told me I could do anything."

For his mother, Sharalean, it was a form of healing, There were times when it was a little overwhelming for me because we would be in the same areas and doing things he was doing. When i look back on it i knew he wouldn't want me to stop."

And their not stopping here. When asked what the family would be working on next, Sharalean found it hard to come up with an answer, "That's a good question. The sky's the limit."
