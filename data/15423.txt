Police have identified the Indianapolis driver who was killed last Friday after a chase ended in a fatal crash as James Donshey. 17.

Donshey, who was allegedly driving a stolen red 2001 Pontiac Aztec, crashed near the intersection of East 38th Street and North Sherman Drive while trying to avoid police, according to a statement from the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department.

Marion County Chief Deputy Coroner Alfarena Ballew said Donshey died of multiple blunt-force injuries.

Officers responded to a report of a stolen vehicle about 8:30 a.m. Friday, Nov. 28. The owner of the car said she left the Aztec running in her driveway while she went inside her house. When she returned, it was gone.

Within half an hour, police received a 911 call stating GPS tracking of the stolen car located it on the 3500 block of Orchard Avenue.

While officers made their way to that area, an officer in a marked patrol car spotted the car and tried to conduct a traffic stop.

Donshey pulled over into a lot in the 3700 block of North Keystone Avenue. He raised his hands as the officer conducted the felony stop and waited for backup. Soon after, though, Donshey fled eastbound on East 38th Street at high speed.

Donshey swerved at East 38th Street and North Sherman Drive, trying to avoid hitting another vehicle. He lost control and crashed against a tree.

The 17-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene by Indianapolis EMS personnel.
