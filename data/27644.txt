The Pueblo Police Department said the suspect attempted to carjack multiple people, including one off-duty Pueblo County Sheriff's Office deputy, Sunday night. Highway 50 in both directions between North Elizabeth Street to Club Manor Drive was blocked off as investigators worked the scene.

Officers received a report of a carjacking around 10 p.m. Sunday at the 7-Eleven located at 3522 N. Elizabeth St. Police said the 35-year-old suspect threatened the victim and hit them with a handgun before taking off in the victim's Dodge truck.
