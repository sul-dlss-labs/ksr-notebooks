A 46-year-old man who was “acting bizarrely,” including running in and out of traffic, was pronounced dead at a hospital Saturday night after “very brief contact” with Anaheim Police officers, the department said on Sunday, June 24.

Police received calls at 5:36 p.m. about the man, who witnesses said was observed in traffic in the 1000 block of W. Lincoln Ave.

“At least one caller said the subject appeared to be trying to get cars to hit him,” Anaheim Police Sgt. Daron Wyatt said in a news release.

A few minutes later, two officers found the man, believed to be a transient, in a nearby parking lot.

“As the officers approached, the subject was acting erratically and the officers attempted to handcuff him for their safety as well as his own safety,” Wyatt said. “The subject resisted and the officers used basic control holds to roll the subject onto his stomach and handcuff him.”

In less than a minute, he said, the officers noticed the man was in medical distress and administered Narcan, an emergency treatment for an opioid overdose, and applied CPR.

Anaheim Fire & Rescue personnel also responded and the man was taken to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Police said they never struck the man or used a carotid restraint, Taser or baton.

The officers wore body cameras that had been activated, according to the release.

The death is being investigated by Orange County District Attorney’s Office with the assistance of Anaheim Police Homicide detectives. The Anaheim Police Major Incident Review Team also is conducting a probe.
