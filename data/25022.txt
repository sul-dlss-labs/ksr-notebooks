The suspect shot Wednesday night by police on Detroit's west site has died, Police Chief James Craig said Thursday.

The 45-year-old man, who had no criminal history, succumbed to multiple gunshot wounds, including at least one in the chest. No police officers were injured.

Police said they are not releasing the name of the suspect.

Craig said he had reviewed the body camera footage from the officers and that the suspect had a holstered weapon on his right side. The footage has not been released.

“One thing I do want to say — that it appears, based on our review, the officers did everything they could correctly,” Craig said.

At about 8:10 p.m. Wednesday, police arrived at a house on the 14900 block of Tireman at Terry Street following a call that a 26-year-old and a 55-year-old had been assaulted.

The suspect had reportedly been to the house several times that day and was acquaintances with at least one person who lived there. At one point, he had brandished a firearm at neighbors, Craig said, and threatened someone with a knife. Alcohol appeared to be involved.

When officers arrived, the suspect had already left. Just as they were about to head out, a witness told them he had returned. He had one hand on a bike, and with the other, Craig said, he appeared to reach for his weapon.

Officers told him to stop but fired a number of times in response to what appeared to be an active threat, Craig said.

Several outlets reported earlier that gunfire was exchanged, but Craig said that wasn't true.

Police then recovered the suspect's nickel-plated automatic, Craig said.

One of the officers has two years of experience, while the other just graduated from the academy two weeks ago. Both are on standard administrative leave.
