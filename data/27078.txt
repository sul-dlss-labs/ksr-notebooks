Officers shot and killed a man armed with a blade in El Monte Monday afternoon, the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.

EL Monte Police Department officers responded to the 9800 block of Cortada Street at about 12:30 p.m. after someone called 911 and hung up, authorities said.

“Upon arrival, the officers were encountered by a suspect armed with a bladed weapon, at which point an officer involved shooting occurred,” the Sheriff’s Department said.

The man was struck in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene. Authorities did not identify the person, and he was only described as a male adult.

A man who identified himself as the suspect’s brother said that even if he had something wrong, police firing at him was unnecessary.

“Did it have to go to that level?” Thai Nguyen said at the scene of the police shooting. “He’s a 115 pounds— even if he had a knife, if you just kick him he’ll fly.”

No officers were injured during the incident.

The Sheriff’s Department has not released information on the events that led up to officers opening fire.

The shooting remains under investigation and no further details were available.

Anyone with information was encouraged to call the Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-8477.
