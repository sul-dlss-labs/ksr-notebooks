BOSTON (CBS) â€“ A Boston police officer shot and killed a man who allegedly lunged at officers with knives Saturday afternoon, police said.

The shooting took place after police received a 911 call shortly after 3 p.m. from a woman who said she was being assaulted by her boyfriend at 77 Lenox St. in the South End.

"The officers attempted to place the suspect under arrest, at which time the suspect armed himself with multiple knives and lunged at the officers," said Boston police Capt. William Gross. "One of the officers discharged his weapon striking the suspect."

The suspect was taken to Boston Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Police did not release the name of the suspect, how many times he was shot or where he was shot.

Lenox Street was blocked Saturday evening while police continued to interview witnesses.

Later Saturday night, an unidentifed distraught woman cried out in tears when she heard that police shot a member of her family.

Neighbor Aaliyah William was stunned by the incident.

"It's crazy how everything happened," she said. "From a domestic violence to a police shooting. I don't know how to feel."

The scene of the shooting is just south of Massachusetts Avenue between Tremont Street and Shawmut Avenue.

The Boston police Firearm Discharge Investigation Team and the Suffolk County District Attorney's Office are investigating.
