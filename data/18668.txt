A man killed himself Monday morning after authorities reported to a domestic disturbance in the 20,000 block of Alvarado Road.

The man, whose name was not released, was combative when officers arrived on scene. As officers tried to calm the 31-year-old male he pulled out a handgun and shot himself, according to a release by the Virginia State Police. No officers discharged a weapon or were injured during the incident.

Washington County Sheriff Fred Newman said the shooting is being investigated by state police, who said late Monday night that the manâ€™s remains were sent to the Office of the Medical Examiner in Roanoke for examination and autopsy.

Newman said he did not believe the man had a criminal history.

VSP is still investigating the incident.
