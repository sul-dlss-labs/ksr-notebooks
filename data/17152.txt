STOCKTON —

A suspected home intruder is dead after a struggle with officers, police said.

According to the Stockton Police Department, officers responded to calls of a home intruder in the 3100 block of Nicole Street in Stockton around 6:11 p.m.

Investigators say the caller reported a male told her that someone was trying to kill him and he ran off after attempting to gain access to the home.

Soon after, another resident in the same block reported the same male was at their residence banging on the back door.

The suspect then proceeded to flee onto the roof of a home in the 3200 block of Nicole Street.

At 6:18 p.m. another call came into dispatch. This time it was reported that the man, later identified as 26-year-old Filberto Valencia, had broken into a group home and was harming a girl inside.

Upon arrival, officers forced entry into the residence and found the suspect barricaded in the bathroom with four females. He had his arms wrapped around a 10-year-old girl’s neck.

The suspect was involved in a physical altercation with Stockton police officers deploying tasers and batons. The suspect died on scene.

Valencia’s family told FOX40 he suffers from schizophrenia and was off his medication.

A protocol investigation is underway.
