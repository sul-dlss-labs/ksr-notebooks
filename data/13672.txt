LIBERTY TOWNSHIP, OH (FOX19) - Alcohol is believed to be a factor in a police pursuit and deadly crash Friday morning in Butler County.



Troopers attempted to stop a black 2013 Subaru Impreza for a traffic violation on Yankee Road in Liberty Township around 1 a.m.



The vehicle reportedly didn't stop and a chase began. Police said the suspect, identified as Kevin Cummings, 24, of Hamilton, went northbound on Yankee Road nearly losing control and reaching speeds in excess of 90 mph.

After turning westbound on Princeton Road, troopers say Cummings accelerated to over 125 mph, lost control of his vehicle after cresting a hill and traveled off the right side of the roadway, striking a utility pole and tree.

It happened just east of State Route 747.

Cummings was pronounced dead at the scene by the Butler County Coroner's Office. He was the only person in the vehicle.

Troopers said multiple open alcohol containers were found throughout the passenger compartment.

Cummings was wearing his seatbelt.

An autopsy performed by the Butler County Coroner's Office showed Cummings died of multiple traumatic injuries.
