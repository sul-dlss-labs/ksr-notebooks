A man who was killed after he shot two Sacramento police officers in south Sacramento was previously arrested in Ohio, according to court documents.Eric Arnold, 41, of Sacramento, opened fire on officers Thursday after he was pulled over for being a wanted suspect in a double homicide in Sacramento, police said.The two officers who were shot suffered non-life-threatening injuries and are expected to survive."Both officers are seasoned-- a 27-year veteran and a 12-year veteran," Sgt. Bryce Heinlein said. "Not only are they coworkers, but they are friends."Arnold was shot and killed by officers who returned fire near the intersection of 27th Avenue and Franklin Boulevard, about a block away from a Sacramento Police substation.A vehicle Arnold was driving was initially spotted on two Sacramento police POD earlier in the day."In this situation the officers had a very good idea of who was in the vehicle, and the danger that this individual posed to them," Heinlein said. Arnold was wanted in connection with the killings of his ex-girlfriend, 45-year-old Erica Wallace, and her daughter, 17-year-old Kiara Lasalle, police said.However, it's not the first time Arnold has run into problems with the law.CRIMINAL HISTORY Arnold was arrested twice in Franklin County, Ohio, on domestic violence charges. The first case in 2003 was dismissed. The second case in 2004 was amended to disorderly conduct, and Arnold was fined and given probation, according to prosecutors.Also in 2004, Arnold was charged with menacing and trespassing. He pleaded guilty to the trespassing charge and the menacing charge was dropped, prosecutors said.WHO WERE ARNOLD'S VICTIMS?Arnold lived with Wallace and her daughter at a home in the 1400 block of Janrick Avenue, Wallace's other daughter, Marcella Lucas, told KCRA 3.The two women were found dead Friday night inside the home suffering from gunshot wounds. Investigators said their killer, identified as Arnold, tried to set the bodies on fire.Lucas said she had bad feelings about Arnold from the start."A lot of red flags from the beginning for me," Lucas said. "Her nickname for him was a controller."Wallace worked in the billing department at the UC Davis Medical Center. Her daughter, Kiara Lasalle, recently graduated from John F. Kennedy High School and was enrolled as a student at Sacramento City College, Lucas said.Stay with KCRA for updates.
