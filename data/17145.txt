MEDFORD -- A grand jury has cleared a Medford off-duty police officer of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a knife-wielding suspect.



The Mail Tribune reports the jury ruled Wednesday that Sgt. Darrell Graham was justified in the January death of 27-year-old Timothy Joseph Alex Caruthers.



Authorities say Caruthers had been caught shoplifting at a sporting goods store in Medford when he threatened employees with a knife. Graham, who had been shopping in the store, identified himself and intervened.



Caruthers ran across a highway and into a parking lot, where authorities say he swung the knife at the officer. Police say that's when Graham fired two shots at the man, killing him.



Graham was placed on administrative leave. He is expected to return to duty after a brief integration period.
