ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – New information has been released in the case of a deadly deputy-involved shooting early in the morning of the Fourth of July.

The Bernalillo County Sheriff’s Office has identified the man involved as 28-year-old Miguel Gonzalez, and deputies say he’s no stranger to law enforcement.

The sheriff says Gonzalez was an admitted gang member with a lengthy rap sheet.

It all started a little after 1 a.m. Tuesday near Old Coors and Coors at a car wash. Deputies were in the area due to suspicious activity at the car wash.

Deputies ran the plate on the car Gonzalez was driving, and it came back as stolen.

The sheriff didn’t call it a chase – rather that Gonzalez left the area and that deputies followed to pull him over. But when deputies stopped Gonzalez at an intersection nearby, he ran off on foot into a neighborhood.

That’s when they say he pulled out a gun.

BCSO says several shots were fired but at this point, it’s unclear as to how many or who fired them.

Officials say they’re waiting to interview the two deputies involved before they release any more information about the actual incident. The deputies are on paid administrative leave.

BCSO says items found in the car Gonzalez was driving, which has not been confirmed as stolen, point to other possible crimes. Investigators would not elaborate on what the items were or what the crimes might be.

Gonzalez’s family has publicly expressed outrage over the fatal shooting. They believe Gonzales was killed in cold blood, and that deputies could have used less lethal force, like a Taser, to subdue him.

Gonzalez has a previous conviction for burglary, along with a record of fleeing from police and assault against a peace officer. He’s also accused of injuring a police K9.

Sheriff’s Deputies say he was released June 7 after 18 months in jail.
