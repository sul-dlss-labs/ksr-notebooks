ANAHEIM (CBSLA) â€“ Two people were killed and a third was seriously wounded in a head-on collision in Anaheim Thursday afternoon during a pursuit involving Orange County Sheriff's deputies.

The crash occurred on Imperial Highway at River Valley Trail a little at 12:48 p.m.

According to an Anaheim police spokesperson, at around 12:33 p.m. deputies received a report of a suspicious person in the 19000 block of Ridgeview Road in Villa Park. The incident turned into a short pursuit on northbound Imperial Highway which ended when the suspect vehicle went into oncoming traffic and crashed head-on into another vehicle, police said.

The male driver of the suspect vehicle -- a Ford Focus -- died at the scene, police said. A male front seat passenger was taken to a hospital, where he also died. A female passenger in the backseat was rushed to a hospital with major injuries. No names were released.

It was initially reported that the front seat passenger was also female but that was erroneous.

The driver of the victim's vehicle -- a silver SUV -- suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries, police said.

Witnesses told CBS2's Stacey Butler that the three suspects were knocking on doors in an effort to see if people were home. When police arrived they fled and the chase was on.

Police told Butler during the chase the male suspect tossed a pillow case that had jewelry and a laptop. The Ford Focus was connected to a robbery in Los Angeles last month, police also said.

No deputies were hurt.
