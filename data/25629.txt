FLINT, MI – Three Flint police officers have been placed on administrative leave following a vehicle pursuit and fatal shooting Sunday morning.

A vehicle pursuit involving Flint police ended around 2:20 a.m. Feb. 24 in an officer-involved shooting on westbound Interstate 69 at Center Road.

Flint Police Detective Sgt. Tyrone Booth issued a statement Sunday afternoon that reads “As a standard practice, the officers involved in the shooting are now on administrative leave while the investigation is being conducted.”

The person shot has been identified by Flint and Michigan State Police as Tommy John-Ernest Kirby, 41, of Flint. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

A Flint police officer is receiving treatment for a minor injury sustained during the incident.

The incident started when Flint police were dispatched to the area of Iowa Avenue and Broadway Boulevard to investigate a suspicious person.

When an officer made contact with the person, the person fled the area in a vehicle which began a pursuit that ended on westbound I-69.

Traffic was diverted off westbound I-69 at Center Road for several hours as police combed over the scene.

The Michigan State Police Crime Lab out of Bridgeport responded to the interstate along with the Michigan State Police’s Third District Special Investigations section.

Michigan State Police Lt. Duane Zook noted they were not involved in any other portion of the incident aside from assisting Flint police on the interstate.

He added the police officer’s injuries did not come as a direct result of the shooting.

The incident remains under investigation.

Flint and Michigan State Police will provide additional information on the incident “in the coming days,” Booth said.
