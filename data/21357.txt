NORTON SHORES, MI – The 51-year-old man who shot himself during a standoff in Norton Shores Tuesday has died from the gunshot injury, police said.

Charles Anton Byer was pronounced dead at 12:16 a.m. Wednesday, according to Norton Shores Police Lt. Jon Gale.

Authorities said Byer shot himself once in the head during the 2 ½ hour standoff in the 6100 block of Lake Harbor Road.

He was transported by ambulance to Mercy Health Partners Hackley Campus where he remained in intensive care for much of Tuesday evening, police had said.

But shortly after midnight he died, authorities said.

The incident that resulted in the standoff began after 9:51 a.m. Tuesday when Norton Shores police officers were dispatched to the 6100 block of Lake Harbor Road. Family members had called expressing concern for Byer's well-being and wanted officers to check his home there because they were concerned for his safety, police said.

While police were investigating, Byer appeared in his front yard with a handgun, police said.

He refused to drop his weapon after several commands by police, then walked several hundred feet away from his home and sat down near a neighbor's shed, Gale had said.

The Muskegon County Emergency Response Team was called to help with security and negotiations. Michigan State Police and a number of other local police and fire departments responded to the scene as well.

Officers then heard one gunshot shortly after 2 p.m. Officers confirmed Byer had shot himself in the head and he was rushed by ambulance to the hospital.

Byer's records on the Michigan Sex Offender Registry and the Michigan Department of Corrections websites show a 2010 conviction in Allegan County of attempted second-degree criminal sexual conduct with a person younger than 13. He was sentenced April 16, 2010, to five years on probation.
