Sheriff’s officials have identified the deputy and suspect involved in a shooting last week in Encinitas.

The San Diego County sheriff’s deputy, identified as Steven Block, shot the 56-year-old man, Gary Kendrick, after Kendrick was found sitting in the grass with the gun pointed at himself.

Officials said that during the Friday morning incident in the 2000 block of Shady Tree Lane, Kendrick had told deputies to shoot him and began to turn the weapon in their direction.

That’s when they said Block feared for his safety and shot several rounds from his department-issued AR-15 rifle.

Kendrick died at the scene. No law enforcement officers were injured.

A neighbor told NBC 7 the suspect had been experiencing marital troubles and deputies had been called out his house before this incident, including a time when the man was throwing things out of the window.

Block has been with the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department for less than five years. Officials say he will be placed on a minimum of three days' paid leave.
