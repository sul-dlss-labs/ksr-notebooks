Authorities released the identity of the man who killed himself early this morning in Elizabeth after leading police on a short chase in a stolen Cadillac and firing at officers from inside the vehicle.

Gary Leland, 47, a convicted felon from Howell Township in Monmouth County, shot himself after crashing his car, according to the Union County Prosecutor's Office.

No police officer was injured in the exchange of gunfire, Elizabeth Police Sgt. Stephen Negrey said.

Authorities said Leland had seven prior felony convictions for burglary and other crimes, and had been driving with a suspended license.

Officers spotted him driving in a tan four-door Cadillac on 2nd Avenue and Atlantic Street at 1:45 a.m., authorities said. The vehicle had been reported stolen last week from McGuire Cadillac, a car dealership in Woodbridge.

When they tried to pull him over, Leland rammed into the police vehicle and drove off, leading officers on a chase, authorities said.

A few blocks away, Leland crashed his car into a parked tractor trailer on South 2nd Street by Butler Street, Negrey said.

As the officers approached the car, Leland fired shots at them, and the officers "appropriately returned fire," the prosecutor's office said in a statement. No one was hit.

Moments later, Leland shot himself once in the head from inside the car, Negrey said. He was pronounced dead at the scene and his gun was recovered. The street is next to an Elizabeth ambulance station house and is surrounded by two-story multifamily homes.

An autopsy by the medical examiner ruled that Leland, who has gone by the names "Gary Bianco," "Juan Colon" and "Michael White," among others, had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the prosecutor's office said.

Elizabeth police and the prosecutor's office are still investigating.
