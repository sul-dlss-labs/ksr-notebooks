WILKES-BARRE – Sue Bitterman closed her eyes.

She was listening to a defense attorney trying to tear apart the prosecution’s case against Jeff Dennis.

There wasn’t sufficient proof, the attorney said, to show Dennis killed his wife, Carli.

Bitterman, Carli’s stepmother, looked elsewhere for help.

“Carli, please let the jury know the truth.” Bitterman asked.

Hours later, she got her wish.

Guilty.

“That was Carli’s answer,” Bitterman said after the jury on Saturday found Jeff Dennis guilty of first-degree murder in the death.

And it led to a judge immediately sentencing the former police officer to spend the rest of his life in prison.

Jeff Dennis said nothing.

Not to the judge at sentencing.

Not as he was being taken back to prison.

He dropped his head to a table when the verdict was read.

Then he sobbed.

The jury’s mere two hours of deliberations capped off a two-week trial that ended on the 20-month anniversary of Carli’s death.

Police and prosecutors said Jeff Dennis, 36, fired a single shot through his 30-year-old wife’s head as she slept inside their home on Ninth Street in Wyoming on Feb. 27, 2006.

Jeff Dennis, Luzerne County prosecutors said, was angry she was having an affair with a co-worker at the Luzerne County 911 center.

Prosecutors Jackie Musto Carroll and David Pedri used forensic evidence and lay witnesses to present their case.

The witnesses, they said, showed Jeff Dennis was abusive and controlling towards Carli.

He even threatened to shoot her and make it look like a suicide.

And the forensic evidence proved Jeff Dennis did just that, they said.

Defense attorneys Al Flora Jr., William Ruzzo, and Ferris Webby called their own forensic experts to testify.

They said the evidence showed Carli shot herself while Jeff Dennis lunged at her.

That debate was the focus of the lengthy trial.

Each day, Carli’s mother, Jill Bitterman, held a picture of her daughter in the courtroom.

It was taken on Carli’s 30th birthday. The last time she saw Carli.

A month later, she was dead.

“When I found out Carli died … I knew she would never have made the choice to take her own life,” she told Jeff Dennis at the sentencing.

No one, she said, deserves to be stripped away from family and friends the way Jeff Dennis stripped Carli, a loving daughter, away from family and friends.

Like Carli’s best friend, Rebecca Smith.

But the way Smith sees it, that didn’t happen when Jeff Dennis killed Carli.

It happened in 1997, when Carli and Jeff Dennis got married, Smith said.

His control of her started.

“It was all taken away, instantly,” Smith told Court of Common Pleas Judge Michael Conahan.

Now, it’s Jeff Dennis’ turn to be controlled, she said.

Behind bars.

Yet Sue Bitterman can’t bring herself to hate Jeff Dennis.

“I feel nothing for you,” she said. “And that is worse than hate.”

Dennis, at one point, became weak, forcing deputy sheriffs to give him a chair to sit in.

Ruzzo said he advised Dennis to remain silent at the sentencing.

The emotions topped off Saturday at the courthouse.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys spent the morning using their closing arguments to try and sway the jury to see the evidence their way.

Flora told the jury his client made mistakes.

Two of them, in particular, he said.

He trusted his cheating, deceitful wife.

And he tried to save her when she put a gun to her head, Flora said.

He shouldn’t have.

“Just let her die,” Flora said. “Let her kill herself.”

Because once Dennis tried to stop her and got blood on himself, it gave police evidence to twist and use against him, he said.

But they were wrong.

And they “were jumping to conclusions” by charging Dennis with killing Carli, he said.

That rush led to prosecutors falling far short of having enough credible evidence to prove Jeff Dennis pulled the trigger, Flora said. They had to fabricate a scenario to fit the evidence, he said.

The true evidence in the case – the gunshot residue on Carli and Jeff Dennis, the location of the spent shell casing, and all the blood spatter – show Carli shot herself while her husband lunged at her, he said.

Prosecutors said that’s what Jeff Dennis wanted investigators to think.

That it was all Carli’s fault.

But they outsmarted him, Musto Carroll said.

The first officer on the scene, Wyoming Patrolman Ken Karns, knew something was wrong.

And hours later, police had a blood spatter expert, Paul Kish, on the scene.

Kish, too, saw something.

In all the blood that spattered throughout that room, Kish detected a 24-inch void on a dresser near the bed Carli was in.

Jeff Dennis’ shirt had blood on the front and top of it. The shirt, she said, is 24 inches wide.

That, Musto Carroll said, is where Jeff Dennis was standing.

The theory was backed up by the trajectory of the bullet that passed through her head. And Jeff Dennis had a bunch of gunshot residue on his hands.

It all made Jeff Dennis guilty of first-degree murder.

Why?

Jeff Dennis stayed at work a half hour later than usual that morning. He wanted to make sure Carli was sleeping by the time he got home, Musto Carroll said.

And after Carli was shot, as she lay in bed bleeding to death, Jeff Dennis moved the gun, washed his hands, and then called 911 before tending to Carli, she said.

“If that’s not premeditation, what is?” she asked. “The Commonwealth has proven to you beyond a reasonable doubt that he’s a killer.”

The defense team said it has a solid appeal issue in Conahan’s ruling that allowed prosecutors to have witnesses testify about comments Carli allegedly made.

The issue, Flora said, is that it was impossible for them to cross-examine Carli about the alleged statements, which they call hearsay.

“The volume of statements is difficult to over come,” Flora said.

District Attorney David Lupas said there’s no real justice in cases where someone like Carli is killed and taken away from her family.

But the prosecutors did their best to bring the family as much justice as possible.

“It’s not about Jeff Dennis,” Lupas said. “It’s about Carli.”

Dennis’ mother said she could not comment on the verdict.
