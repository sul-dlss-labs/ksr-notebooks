A grand jury on Monday said a fatal shooting by Alachua County Sheriff’s deputies was justified, the state attorney’s office said.

The jury found that the Jan. 20 shooting of Gino Martin Palazzolo, 39, by Deputies Charles Drake and Jasper Stephenson was justifiable homicide.

That night, deputies got a tip saying a wanted man was staying at the Scottish Inn, at 4341 SW 13th St.

Deputies found Palazzolo in the parking lot, waving a firearm and threatening to shoot himself or to “force” law enforcement to shoot him, a sheriff's news release said.

Palazzolo fled on foot and was found between two of the hotel’s buildings, gun still in hand. When deputies told Palazzolo to drop it, he refused.

Drake and Stephenson then shot Palazzolo.

In a sworn complaint filed in January, Gainesville police officers working with the Gainesville-Alachua County Drug Task Force said in September, Palazzolo sold 10 Xanax pills to a confidential source working for the task force.

In that complaint, police said Palazzolo was a handyman who lived in an apartment at 710 NW 16th Ave. in Gainesville.
