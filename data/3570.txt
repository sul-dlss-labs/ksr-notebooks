Michael Hebert

A convict who shot and killed a Bossier City Police officer, and then committed suicide, told his wife he would kill officers who arrived at the couple's home, investigators said. Michael Hebert, 65, pulled a gun on his wife Wednesday afternoon but she was able to get away, according to Bossier City Police Chief Mike Halphen. Halphen says the woman called 911 using a cell phone but the call "dropped out". A dispatcher then sent officers to investigate the 911 hang up call.



"As she was leaving the house, she told him she was calling police," Halphen said. "And he said, 'Fine, I'll get at least one of them before they get me.' And he did," Halphen added. Officer Trey Hutchison was the first to arrive at the home and was apparently unaware of the danger on the other side of the door. "He (Hebert) was waiting for the officer and as soon as he knocked, he (Hebert) pulled the door open and shot him," Halphen said.



The second officer on the scene discovered Hutchison on the ground, shot in the back. The wounded officer was airlifted to LSU Medical Center in Shreveport where he died about an hour later. Investigators say he was wearing a bullet-proof vest. He received two gunshot wounds, investigators said.

Wednesday's incident was not Hebert's first brush with the law. "In the 70's, he did five years at Angola for armed robbery and kidnapping," Halphen said. "And we have an unconfirmed report that he shot a deputy in South Louisiana at some point and was institutionalized for a year."



Hutchison, a 1995 graduate of Airline High School in Bossier City, had been on the force less than a year. Prior to that, he worked for about four years with the Lufkin, Texas police department, fellow officers said. "When I hired him, he said it was a dream come true to work for the Bossier City Police Department," Halphen said. Funeral services for the officer are scheduled for 2pm Saturday at First Baptist Church in Bossier City.
