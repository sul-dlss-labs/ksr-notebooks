WOOD COUNTY, W.Va. (WTAP) - UPDATE: 1/14/2020

No criminal charges will be brought against Lt. Jason Allen of the Wood County Sheriff’s Department after a 21-year-old man died in an officer-involved shooting in October, according to a Wood County grand jury report released on Thursday.

Allen and Paul Bailey were involved in an altercation on Stillwell Road that led to Bailey’s death.

Shawn Bailey, Paul’s 25-year-old brother, was also involved in the fight and was charged with malicious assault of a law-enforcement officer.

Sheriff Steve Stephens said Thursday afternoon that an internal investigation by his department also found no wrongdoing on Allen’s part and that there were no violations of department policies or procedures.

After consulting with Prosecuting Attorney Pat Lefebure, Stephens said he could not comment further because of the pending charges against Shawn Bailey.

Authorities said Allen was responding to a call on Stillwell Road that night when he encountered the Baileys and a woman, who allegedly had been using LSD and screaming at cars as they drove by.

During a preliminary hearing for Shawn Bailey in Wood County Magistrate Court, Allen said then when he approached the group Paul Bailey attacked his cruiser. Later, Allen testified that Shawn Bailey “sucker punched” him while he was attempting to arrest his brother.

Allen suffered serious facial injuries during the fight and had to have reconstructive surgery.

The grand jury heard testimony from West Virginia State Police, witnesses and examined other evidence, including from an in-car camera, during its investigation.

UPDATE: 11/20/2020

The Wood County Grand Jury will hear the case of a man accused in an incident October 17 involving a sheriff’s deputy, in which the defendant’s younger brother died.

Shawn Michael Bailey appeared for a preliminary hearing Friday afternoon in Wood County Magistrate Court.

Lt. Jason Allen testified in court that Shawn Bailey “sucker punched” him while the deputy was trying to handcuff his brother, Paul.

Deputy Allen said Paul Bailey had attacked his cruiser when it approached the Bailey brothers and a woman who were walking along the side of Stillwell Road.

The deputy suffered several injuries in the scuffle and said he had to have reconstructive surgery.

A Wood County man is dead and his brother has been charged with malicious assault of a law-enforcement officer following a fight and officer-involved shooting involving a Wood County sheriff’s deputy Saturday night, court records show.

Shawn Michael Bailey, 25, of Walker, was arrested Saturday night after the incident on Stillwell Road that resulted in sheriff’s Lt. J.W. Allen being treated for serious facial injuries and bite marks on his arm at WVU Medicine Camden Clark hospital.

Sheriff Steve Stephens said Sunday that Lt. Allen had been released from the hospital and is expected to make a full recovery.

Bailey’s brother has not been identified by authorities, but Bailey was arraigned in Wood County Magistrate Court after the incident and remains in the North Central Jail on a $35,000 bond.

WTAP has attempted to obtain information from the The West Virginia State Police, which is handling the investigation, but a spokesman on Monday referred all questions about the incident to Stephens' office.

Stephens said Monday that he had been in contact with Prosecuting Attorney Pat Lefebure’s office and advised that he could not release any information because the State Police investigation is pending.

According to a criminal complaint filed in magistrate court, Trooper S.D. Cook responded to Stillwell Road, between Farrow and Grant Hill roads, just before 8 p.m. Saturday to “an officer involved shooting with a Wood County deputy requesting assistance.”

When Trooper Cook arrived, he reported finding Lt. Allen “visibly shaken and emotional” and covered in blood.

Trooper Cook said Allen told him he had been assaulted by “multiple suspects” while investigating a 911 call about people in the road yelling at passersby.

The complaint said Bailey told officers that he and his brother and a woman had been using “acid” and yelling at cars driving by on Stillwell Road and that a fight broke out after Lt. Allen attempted to detain his brother.

He said that while trying to handcuff his brother, Lt. Allen used a Taser in an effort to subdue him. Bailey admitted to punching Allen in the face after his brother was hit by the Taser.

The complaint does not say when the shooting happened.
