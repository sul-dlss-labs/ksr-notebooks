DURHAM, N.C. â€” The Durham County District Attorney's Office issued a statement Tuesday absolving campus police at North Carolina Central University of any wrongdoing in the shooting death of Tracy Daquan Bost, 22, of Charlotte, in September.

N.C. Central and Durham police were searching for a robbery suspect Sept. 23, 2013, when they came upon Bost. He fired a shotgun at officers near the intersection of Cecil and Lincoln streets, then fired additional shots from the cover of some bushes.

"He ignored the multiple commands by law enforcement to relinquish his weapon and surrender, thus placing the officers in danger of great bodily harm and death. Officers returned fire, which resulted in Mr. Bost's death," District Attorney Leon Stanback wrote.

"Although this is a tragic tum of events, nothing from the complete investigative report indicates any willful, malicious or criminally negligent conduct by law enforcement or the existence of the use of unreasonable or excessive force."

Stanback's report means the three campus officers involved in the shooting will not face criminal charges.

According to an autopsy report, Bost was shot once in the chest and once in the left thigh. The bullet to the chest broke apart and wounded his heart and lungs, killing him, the report states.

A toxicology report found that Bost had no drugs or alcohol in his system other than antihistamine.
