ROSCOMMON TOWNSHIP, MI

â€” Investigators are piecing together the circumstances of a police-involved shooting in Roscommon County that left a 75-year-old man dead.

The night of Wednesday, Jan. 15, a domestic violence situation occurred at a house on Standard Street near Kennedy Drive in Roscommon Township. By the early morning of the next day, people inside called 911 and Roscommon County Sheriff's deputies and officers with the Northern Michigan Tactical Alliance responded to the scene, according to 1st Lt. John Card of the Michigan State Police Houghton Lake Post.

By about 12:30 a.m., police had removed the two alleged victims from the home, Card said.

"Once they had pulled the other two out, they tried to set up a dialogue with the suspect," Card said. At that point, the 75-year-old resident came out on the front porch and pointed a handgun at officers, Card said.

"When he pulled the weapon, he was told, 'Put it down, put it down,'" the lieutenant said. "When he refused, shots were fired."

Police later went into the house and found the man dead inside, Card said.

The shooting happened about 3:30 a.m. Card was contacted shortly thereafter, as the sheriff's office requested the state police assist in investigating the matter.

No officers were hurt in the incident and investigators are in the process of determining how many shots were fired and if the suspect fired any himself.

Investigators are not releasing the deceased man's name at this time.
