A police pursuit ended in a fatal crash when a 16-year-old boy driving an allegedly stolen car collided with another vehicle on a freeway offramp in Arcadia, police said Saturday.

The crash occurred about 9:50 p.m. Friday on the Baldwin Avenue offramp of the westbound 210 Freeway, police said.

The unidentified teenager allegedly stole a 2004 Toyota Camry in a carjacking in Irwindale, according to police reports, and was fleeing officers when he lost control of the car and hit a 2002 Honda Civic.
