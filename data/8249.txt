Pedro Fernandez, a 24-year-old Latino, was shot by a police officer and died on July 6 in the 11300 block of Iowa Avenue in Sawtelle, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

Fernandez, of Tarzana, and another man were robbing a man and a woman when a police officer drove by in an unmarked patrol car, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

When Officer Kenneth Collard got out of the patrol car, the other man ran off and Fernandez approached with an object in his hand, police said.

Collard shot Fernandez in the torso, and he died at the scene. Fernandez and the other man, identified by police as Matthew Ryan Ingels, 23, were also suspects in an earlier robbery. Ingles was found and arrested shortly after the incident.
