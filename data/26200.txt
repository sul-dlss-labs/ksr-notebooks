AKRON, Ohio — Police have identified a man they say shot his ex-girlfriend in the back as she shielded her three children before taking his own life when confronted by officers.

Akil Scott Jackson, 24, of Akron, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to results of an autopsy by the Summit County Medical Examiner’s Office.

The 23-year-old female victim survived her wounds and was taken to Akron City Hospital. Her three young children were not injured.

An update on the woman’s condition was not available Monday evening.

According to police, the woman was walking with her children at about 5 p.m. Sunday with a female friend and her child near the intersection of East Exchange Street and South Arlington Avenue in the Arlington neighborhood.

Police say Jackson, an ex-boyfriend who is the father of the victim’s youngest child, pulled up in a pickup truck into the closed intersection of East Exchange Street and River Street.

Jackson got out of the truck and walked toward the woman, first exchanging words and then getting into a physical confrontation. Police say Jackson pulled out a handgun and fired several shots. The woman, attempting to shield her three children, was wounded in the back.

The other woman ran with her child to a nearby gas station, police say.

Jackson ended up exchanging gunfire with an armed security guard who was working at a nearby construction site. Police say Jackson tried to again shoot the female victim but his gun jammed.

Police say Jackson eventually tried to run from the scene but was confronted by officers. Jackson then put the gun to his head and shot himself, police say. He was taken to Akron City Hospital but he died of his wounds.
