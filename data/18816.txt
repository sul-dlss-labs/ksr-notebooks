GRAFTON, W.Va. — A Grafton man was shot and killed by the Taylor County Sheriff Terry Austin Friday afternoon as the sheriff was trying to execute a bench warrant, the second officer-involved shooting in as many days in the town, Taylor County Prosecutor John Bord said.

Daniel McMasters, 38, had been indicted for failing register as a sex offender. He didn’t show up for his arraignment in circuit court last Monday and a judge issued a capias warrant for his arrest. Austin and other police officers went to his home on Pearl Street in Grafton at around noon Friday, Bord said.

“Mr. McMasters at some point and time pulled a gun on the sheriff. The sheriff was left with no other choice than to shoot him,” Bord said.

A state police trooper and Grafton police officer were also at the scene, according to the prosecutor.

The shooting came a day after another officer-involved shooting in Grafton. Kyle Jenkins, 24, of Grafton, allegedly threatened a Grafton police officer with a knife near the city’s fire department Thursday afternoon and then later threatened another officer who shot him. Jenkins was in stable condition at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown Friday, Bord said.

Jenkins was charged with two counts of attempted first degree murder Friday afternoon.

“This is extremely unusual for the town of Grafton. I’m not sure the last time was we had an officer shooting,” Bord said.

Bord said both shootings remain under investigating but it appears the law enforcement officers involved took appropriate action.

“By all appearances they are both justified,” he said.
