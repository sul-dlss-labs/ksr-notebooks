WAVELAND, MS (WLOX) - The Mississippi Highway Patrol says a Waveland police officer failed to yield the right of way in a September accident that killed a cyclist.

The accident happened at the intersection of Highway 90 and Bouslog Street in Bay St. Louis when the officer collided with an SUV, causing the SUV to hit Francisco Jesus Mendoza Suarez. The 33-year-old was on a bicycle.

The Highway Patrol does not plan to file any criminal charges against the officer.

Waveland Police Chief Jimmy Varnell identified the officer involved in the accident as Darrel Russell who's been with the department three years.

Meanwhile, Suarez's mother has filed a lawsuit against the city of Waveland. Chief Varnell told WLOX News he couldn't comment on pending litigation.
