FT. LAUDERDALE (CBSMiami) – A woman has died after she was struck by a Broward Sheriff's deputy's patrol car.

The woman, 46-year old Helen Adams, and her longtime boyfriend, John Adams, were crossing Federal Highway in front of Broward Health Imperial Point Hospital at NE 62nd Street around 3 a.m. when she was struck by Cpl. Jeffrey Bates.

"I heard the hit, and saw her landed on her head, said an emotional Adams. "I ran to her tried to perform CPR trying to bring her back to life."

Adams told CBS4's Natalia Zea that they were in the hospital's emergency room because his girlfriend had been complaining of chest pains. He said they left the hospital and were going to a 7-Eleven store across the street when she was hit.

"He was flying. He was speeding…I know he was. He was going faster than he should have, and he never tried to swerve around her. He never tried to hit brakes either. He just ran right over her," said Adams.

He added that the deputy's patrol car did not have its flashing lights or siren on at the time of the accident.

Helen Adams was taken to Broward Health North where she died.

The sheriff's office said Bates was on duty at the time of the accident.

None of the information given by Adams was confirmed by the sheriff's office which said the accident is under investigation.

"The deputy will return to work for his regular shift whenever that may be. This is not like a deputy-involved shooting where there's an automatic leave involved. However, if it's determined that he should not be at work, then he'll be given time off," said Dani Moschella of BSO.

Bates has been with BSO for 11 years. Official say he has had one prior preventable crash which had no injuries.
