Greensboro police said several people were firing back and forth at each other near the South Eugene Street entrance of the courthouse. Two others were injured, including one critically. Greensboro police said 20-year-old Avion McLean, of Laurinburg, died in the shooting.Police said they are looking for any additional victims and for anyone who may have witnessed the shooting.McLean made headlines in December 2017 when he and one other person were charged in High Point in connection to a string of shootings on Thissell Street and an investigation involving stolen weapons. "This is insane, to have a shooting in broad daylight like this in the middle of downtown," Greensboro Police Chief Brian James said. "(It's a) heavily populated area, people going to court, people going to work, people just trying to live. This is absolutely insane and I am very concerned," said James. James said at the time of the shooting, there were a lot of people and a lot of shots were fired. James said right now it does look like this shooting was targeted, but there are still a lot of moving parts as police try and figure out if there were more victims, comb through surveillance video, talk with witnesses and continue their investigation. “A number of shots were fired, we heard multiple witnesses describe the shooting that occurred, so I would say a lot of shots were fired and we are working the scene to collect any evidence that will give us an indication of how many shots were fired,” James said. He also said it looks like vehicles may have been involved in some way.“We are not sure how the suspects actually arrived here, but we do have evidence that there were people involved in this incident that were on foot and we do have reason to believe that vehicles were involved,” he said.Click the video player below to hear from the Greensboro police chief about the shooting.WXII 12 News meteorologist Dave Aiken was caught in the crossfire of the shooting.Aiken said he was leaving his job as a DJ at Rock 92 and was sitting at the intersection of Elm and Eugene streets in his car when the gunfire broke out.During the ordeal, Aiken's car was hit by five bullets and one grazed his arm.Aiken said the injury felt like a bee sting, but that he is OK.
