Oscar Lotari Romero, a 47-year-old Latino, died after an officer-involved shooting Wednesday, July 29, in the 12000 block of Rose Hedge Drive in Whittier, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

The incident began about 11 p.m. when Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department deputies from the Pico Rivera Station received a call about a family disturbance, according to a department news release.

When deputies arrived in the residential area, they were told Romero was drunk, arguing and damaging property, the release said.

Romero came outside and allegedly told deputies that "he was going to bash their heads in," according to the release, and then went back inside.

Romero then came out again, this time carrying a metal stick, which he allegedly swung at a deputy, striking him in the arm, according to the release.

The deputy whom Romero allegedly struck fired his gun, hitting Romero in the upper torso, according to the release. His partner used his Taser, also striking Romero in the upper torso.

Romero was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:53 p.m., according to coroner’s records. The cause of death has been deferred pending further tests, according to coroner’s spokesman Ed Winter.

The deputy was taken to a local hospital where he was treated for bruises on his left arm.

The Sheriff’s Department has not identified the deputies involved in the incident.

Anyone with information is asked to call the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
