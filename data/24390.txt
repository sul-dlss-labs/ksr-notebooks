KINGMAN–A home invasion investigation has now turned into a death investigation after the suspect died at University Medical Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Kingman Police Deputy Chief Rusty Cooper said officers responded to a resident in the 3500 block of North Bond Street on May 5 shortly before 4 a.m. for a report of a male subject running around the area screaming, falling and jumping on cars.

The subject was identified as Chad Garrick Davis, 28, of Kingman.

Cooper said it was also being reported Davis had allegedly entered a home on North Bond Street and assaulted an 85-year-old resident. Davis allegedly pushed the victim to the ground causing significant bruises and abrasions. The victim was taken by ambulance to Kingman Regional Medical Center and later admitted for her injuries.

Furthermore, while officers were aiding the victim, Davis reportedly returned and approached the officer in an erratic manner.

Cooper said Davis reportedly refused the officer’s commands and the officer deployed his taser. He was taken into custody at that time without further incident, however, officers reportedly noticed Davis had significant head and facial injuries.

Investigator’s believe Davis sustained the damages by falling numerous times before police arrived, said Cooper.

Davis was taken to KRMC and later to University Medical Center, where it was determined Davis had been suffering a serious medical event, which in turn reportedly caused his erratic behavior. Alcohol or other causes of impairment are not suspected at this time. The Clark County Medical Examiner’s Office is conducting the death investigation.
