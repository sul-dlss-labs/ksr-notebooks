COLUMBIA, Tenn. (WKRN) – A man described as being “extremely intoxicated” who was caught in the act of raping and attacking a woman in Columbia died while officers were arresting him.

The incident happened on Beckett Street on April 18 around 3 a.m.

Columbia police reported they arrived to the home and could hear yelling inside. Once they entered, they found 40-year-old Brian Acton, naked and attacking a woman in the bedroom.

An officer was able to loosen Acton’s grip on the victim and subdue him until more officers arrived at the scene.

Police said Acton appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs as he was unable to acknowledge their commands, couldn’t focus on officers and was mumbling his words.

Officers called an ambulance and described Acton as someone who was “extremely intoxicated.”

Before first responders got the scene, police said Acton fell unconscious. Life-saving efforts led by both officers and EMS personnel were unsuccessful.

Acton was pronounced dead shortly after arriving at the Maury Regional Medical Center.

The victim later told police that Acton was an acquaintance and she let him inside when he came over.

The two were talking in the living room when she left to use the bathroom. When she returned, she found the 40-year-old naked inside her bedroom.

When Acton reportedly refused to leave the home, he began attacking and raping her.

The 30-year-old victim yelled for her 10-year-old child to go next door and alert the neighbors who then called 911.

The victim suffered minor injuries during the assault. She was treated and released from a nearby hospital.

Police reported Acton was a convicted sex offender out of Kentucky and also on the sex offender’s registry.

His body was sent for an autopsy. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation will be called in to help if further investigation is required.
