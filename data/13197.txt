A Sweet Home man died Friday night when he lost control of his speeding motorcycle after attempting to elude police, crashing into a tree.

Oregon State Police are investigating the crash that happened shortly before 10:30 p.m., said Lieutenant Gregg Hastings, an agency spokesman.

Numerous area law enforcement agencies were assisting Sweet Home Police Friday night with increased patrol and enforcement presence during the Oregon Jamboree music festival in Sweet Home.

Just after 10:20 p.m., an Albany police officer attempted to stop a 2005 Ducati motorcycle for a traffic violation near 15th Avenue and Long Street in Sweet Home.

The motorcyclist, Lance Morgan Hawken, 42, of Sweet Home, failed to yield and attempted to elude police at a high rate of speed, Hastings said.

The officer lost sight of the motorcycle and terminated the pursuit as Hawken traveled southbound on 8th Avenue.

Minutes later, a witness telephoned 911 to report a motorcycle crash with a man down in the front yard of a residence on 8th Avenue near Birch Street. Emergency responders arrived and were unable to revive Hawken, who was pronounced deceased at the scene.

Police say Hawkens attempted to negotiate a curve on 8th Avenue when he lost control and traveled off the roadway into a yard, striking a tree. He was wearing a protective helmet.

Speed was a contributing factor in the crash, Hastings said.
