GAINES TOWNSHIP -- A man who died on a Gaines Township street after breaking into a car-repair shop, then going through a creek, died from hypothermia, police said today.

Millard Griffin, 48, died after apparently collapsing on the street about 11:40 p.m. Saturday at Manila Street SE and Division Avenue.

Kent County Undersheriff Jon Hess said investigators think Griffin broke into Rick's Garage, 6556 S. Division Avenue, about 9 p.m. Saturday.

Police responded to the area after the business owner, who was inside the shop at the time, heard someone inside the office.

The burglar fled, jumping through the same window he broke moments earlier, and escaped the area. Police called a tracking dog to try to locate him, but could not.

Later, deputies responded to Manila Street and Division Avenue on a report of a man in the street, suffering from medical problems. He had no shirt and his pants were wet.

The next morning police found clothing and a cell phone next to a nearby creek that flows into Buck Creek.

Hess said he did not know the depth of the creek but said: "I can guarantee you the water had to be cold,"

Griffin has an extensive criminal record and was on parole from an earlier conviction for receiving and concealing stolen property.
