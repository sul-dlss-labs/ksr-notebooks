A man wanted for sexually battering his girlfriend was shot and killed in a busy Lakeland parking lot Thursday as he fled from officers and attempted to pull a gun from his waistband, police said.

David Cuevas, 42, was issued a warrant for sexual battery in Lakeland about a month ago, Sgt. Gary Gross said. He fled to Pennsylvania, where he was arrested on the outstanding warrant.

Cuevas refused extradition to Florida, and was released on $35,000 in bail, Gross said. Police in Lakeland did not know why he was freed.

But Cuevas started making his way back to Lakeland, sending his girlfriend threatening text messages along the way, Gross said.

“He starts texting our victim saying, ‘I’m coming back, I’m gonna make all the pain go away,'” Gross said.

His girlfriend contacted Lakeland Police, Gross said.

“She was the real hero, because she called us,” he said.

Police made sure she was in a safe place, took her phone and spent about three hours texting Cuevas pretending to be his girlfriend, arranging a meeting in a park near Lake Gibson.

Cuevas got to the park around 5:30 p.m. and found his girlfriend wasn’t there, but two detectives were waiting for him. Once he saw the police, Cuevas started running toward a busy Five Guys Burgers and Fries parking lot on North Socrum Loop Road, Gross said.

“When he ran by the parking lot, there were a lot of witnesses, it was packed,” Gross said.

As he ran, the detectives said they saw Cuevas reach for a gun in his waistband, Gross said.

They shot him. Gross said he did not know how many bullets they fired.

Cuevas was pronounced dead at the scene. He had a bullet wound near the gun in his waistband, and police believe he may have also shot himself.

The two detectives, whose names were not immediately released, were not injured. They will be placed on paid administrative leave in accordance with protocol.
