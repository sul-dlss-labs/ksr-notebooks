SUGAR LAND, Texas â€“ The southbound lanes of the Southwest Freeway at the Grand Parkway are open but traffic is still slow after the freeway was closed for two hours Tuesday afternoon.

It was closed because of a deadly auto-pedestrian accident.

According to Sugar Land police, Fort Bend County sheriff's deputies spotted a man driving erratically and attempted to pull him over.

Deputies said the suspect jumped out of the car and began to struggle with them.

"When they activated their emergency lights, the vehicle made a hard left turn across several lanes of traffic and struck the center wall. The driver exited the vehicle, struggled with police officers before breaking free and attempting to run across several lanes of traffic. He was hit by a vehicle and transported to the hospital, where he died," Sugar Land Police spokesperson Doug Adolph said.

KPRC 2 asked why the man may have been running from police, but investigators said that is not known at this point.

The man has been identified as Isidro Alejandro Martinez. Police said Martinez, 22, has an extensive criminal history including robbery, assault and burglary.
