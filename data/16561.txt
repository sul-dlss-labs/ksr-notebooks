Crime & Safety 2 Brothers Dead in Deputy-Involved Shooting One brother was shot by deputies. The other was dead before law enforcement arrived. Reply

An argument between two brothers turned deadly for both on Tuesday.

According to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office, deputies were alerted to a possible domestic situation at 11008 Smoken Gun Lane in Thonotosassa around 3:17 p.m. by a relative of Todd Tomlinson, 53, of Plant City. When deputies arrived, they found Todd Tomlinson outside his brother Scott’s home.

Todd, deputies say, was standing in the driveway, holding a handgun. “Several commands were given to drop the weapon,” an email to media from the sheriff’s office stated. When Todd didn’t comply and raised the firearm, deputies “in fear for their lives” fired at him. “The suspect was struck multiple times and was pronounced dead at the scene.”

Deputies then searched the home and found the body of Scott Tomlinson, 51, in the kitchen. Scott, the email said, appeared to have been shot multiple times. Scott and Todd, the agency said, were biological brothers. What occurred between the two before the shooting remains unknown.

The deputies involved in the shooting of Todd Tomlinson have been identified as Mark Barnwell, 52, a 29-year veteran; and Master Deputy Irazema “Izzy” Viera Roquemore, 45, a 15-year veteran. Both have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of an administrative review of Tuesday’s events. No further information is being released at this time.
