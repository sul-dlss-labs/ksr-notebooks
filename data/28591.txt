A man who was suspected in a fatal shooting in Portland earlier this week died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound Thursday in Vancouver after he was pursued by a SWAT team from the Clark County Sheriff’s Office, officials said Friday.

On Wednesday around 5:45 a.m., Portland police responded to reports of a shooting near the intersection of Northeast Sandy Boulevard and 115th Avenue. Investigators found two people had been shot, one of them fatally. The man who died was identified Friday as 24-year-old James Greenwood. The injured person was expected to recover.

The following day, investigators in Portland obtained a warrant for the arrest of suspect and learned he worked in Vancouver. Detectives conducted surveillance on the location in Vancouver and notified local authorities of their investigation.

Around 5 p.m., a SWAT team from the sheriff’s office attempted to serve the warrant near the suspect’s workplace near near Northeast 78th Street and Northeast 19th Court. The suspect fled into a nearby building and barricaded himself into a bathroom, officials said. Crisis negotiators established contact with the man by cell phone and tried to convince him to surrender.

At some point during the standoff, the man took his own life, officials said.

Police said they would not release the suspect’s identity until his family had been notified.

There is help available for those contemplating suicide, including the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 1-800-273-8255, where operators are available 24 hours a day.
