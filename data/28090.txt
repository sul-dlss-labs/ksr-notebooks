Cody Johns, who was pregnant was shot and killed by her ex-boyfriend, who later killed himself.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- The manhunt for a suspect who shot four people, including his pregnant ex-girlfriend, ended in the suspect killing himself inside a truck in northeast Harris County.

Police say 30-year-old Kendrick Dante Thomas shot his ex-girlfriend, identified as 24-year-old Cody Johns, and her sister and mother at a home in the 6900 block of Landor St. at 5:30 a.m. Wednesday.

Johns and her unborn baby died at the home. The victim's mother and sister are both in serious but stable condition. They are expected to survive.

"Sadly, our deceased victim was 7 months pregnant," said HPD Chief Art Acevedo.

Friends say Johns moved into her parents' house to get away from Thomas.

According to authorities, after Thomas shot the three women, he went to a home in the 7100 block of Hedgewood, where he shot his ex-girlfriend's current boyfriend. James Bass was shot twice and is in stable condition. He is also expected to recover.

Police say that around 2:18 p.m, investigators tracked down Thomas hiding in the cab of his uncle's 18-wheeler in the 4800 block of FM 1960.

Acevedo said once the suspect was surrounded, he shot himself to death.

Police say with the COVID-19 pandemic and people staying home, there's an increase in domestic violence. But there are resources to help victims escape.

The first step is a phone call to police or an organization such as the Houston Area Women's Center. To contact HAWC, call 713-528-2121.
