Ankeny police shoot and kill man who reportedly was suicidal

An Ankeny police officer shot and killed a man this morning (Thursday) at an apartment that police had been called to numerous times in the past. Police chief Gary Mikulec says they were called to the apartment on the southeast side of Ankeny about 7:25 a-m on the report a man who was on drugs and suicidal. He says officers arrived at the apartment and spoke with 20-year-old Arman Zilic. Mikulec says they spoke with Zilic for roughly five minutes, and during that time Zilic had a sawed-off shotgun on his lap, and continued to snort cocaine. He says officers asked Zilic several times to raise his arms and push himself away from the desk. Mikulec says the three officers continued to try and talk Zilic into giving up — but were unsuccessful. He says Zilic gripped the shotgun and turned toward officer Lincoln Schmeiser. He says Schmeiser had his weapon drawn and fired two shots — fatally wounding Zilic. Mikulec says this was one of multiple calls they’d made to Zilic’s apartment. He says, “We’ve been to that apartment before, we’ve dealt with this person. And uh, we know his behavior has been unpredictible with all those past dealings and its why we sent three offices on this call.” Mikulec says he doesn’t know the exact details of all the calls, but says the most recent trip to Zilic’s two weeks ago also involved a weapon. He says they were able to talk Zilic into dropping the weapon and transported him for treatment. Mikulec says the officer that fired the shots, Lincoln Schmeiser has been on the Ankeny Department for six years. He says it’s the first time Schmeiser has fired his weapon in the line of duty. He says, “The officer’s quite shaken by this incident.” Officer Schmeiser and two sergeants from the department who were also at the scene have been put on administrative leave while the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation reviews the shooting.
