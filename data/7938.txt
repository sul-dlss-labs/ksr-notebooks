A 20-year-old Lake Saint Louis man died after leading the Missouri State Highway Patrol on a chase Thursday.

At 8:57 a.m., Loren M. Ryan was eastbound on Zumbehl Road when he lost control of his 1989 Honda CBR motorcycle, according to the highway patrol.

Patrol spokesman Sgt. Al Nothum said a highway patrolman saw Ryan weaving through traffic at a high speed on Interstate 70 and attempted to pull him over, but Ryan led the trooper in a chase.

Ryan's exact speed was not known, Nothum said.

"Our major crash team is in the process of reconstructing that. We've had people indicate he was driving in excess of 80 to 100 miles an hour," Nothum said.

The trooper chased Ryan to the Highway 94 exit then lost sight of the motorcycle, Nothum said.

The trooper suspended the chase then saw Ryan's motorcycle behind him on Highway 94, Nothum said.

The trooper turned around and chased after Ryan again, Nothum said. As Ryan was negotiating a turn on Zumbehl Road, he wiped out and was fatally injured, Nothum said.

"Anytime you ever run from the police nothing good can ever come from it," Nothum said.

According to Missouri Case.net, Ryan was ticketed for speeding in December of last year.
