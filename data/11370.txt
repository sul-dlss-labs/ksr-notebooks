Suspect Arrested in Fatal Traffic Accident at 7000 State Highway 288

May 24, 2012 - Charges are pending against a suspect arrested in a fatal traffic accident at 7000 State Highway 288 about 12:45 a.m. today (May 24).



The suspect, Monson Durham (b/m, DOB: 8-5-68), faces a charge of intoxication manslaughter in the death of a motorcyclist, Troy Allen Randle, 45, of Anahuac. A photo of suspect Durham is not available at this time.



HPD Vehicular Crimes Division Sergeant S. Sorge and Senior Police Officer R. Bymaster reported:



HPD officers initiated a traffic stop on a Kawasaki motorcycle (operated by the victim) on the southbound freeway entrance ramp from Yellowstone. The officers drove along side the motorcycle to inform the operator to move off the ramp to a safer location, the next exit ahead on the freeway. It was then that a Chevrolet Z71 truck drove up from behind, sideswiped the officers' patrol vehicle and then struck the motorcycle. The impact ejected the driver (Durham) of the truck and killed the motorcyclist. The injured driver was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital with head injuries. The officers were not injured.



Tests revealed Durham was over the legal limit of intoxication and charges against him are forthcoming.
