SUTTER COUNTY (CBS13) â€“ A Sutter County man is dead after being shot by deputies on Monday night after he allegedly tried to ram them with his car.

The shooting happened around 10 p.m. in the 900 block of Mesa Verde in Yuba City. Sutter County Sheriff's deputies responded after getting calls reporting a person driving recklessly.

Witnesses say 72-year-old Jagtar Singh Kang was driving erratically up and down the street even swerving at people.

A deputy arrived and was talking with a witness when he spotted Kang driving toward him, according to Undersheriff Jeff Pierce.

Pierce says the deputy fired several shots at Kang after he ignored orders to stop. Kang was transported to a hospital but later pronounced dead.

There are reports that Kang may have been upset over fireworks being set-off in the neighborhood.

"People were shooting off illegal fireworks and he was upset," a neighbor who did not want to be identified told CBS13. "Every Fourth of July he'd get angry at people shooting off fireworks especially the illegal ones."

Evidence markers litter the street where Kang was shot, several next to burned out illegal fireworks like bottle rockets.

The deputy is on paid administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated.

Authorities are waiting on toxicology tests to determine if Kang was under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Neighbors say this isn't the first time Kang has had arguments with neighbors over the illegal fireworks. But this is the first time the arguments turned physical.
