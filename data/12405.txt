OCEAN SPRINGS, Mississippi -- Kaytlynn Brann, 16, of Ocean Springs died Saturday afternoon from injuries sustained when she was struck by a truck Friday evening on Pointe aux Chenes Road in Gulf Park Estates, according to Jackson County Sheriff Mike Byrd.

The driver of the blue 2010 Chevrolet pickup truck was identified as Daniel Snyder, 44, who resides nearby on Noble Road. Byrd said Snyder is a Pascagoula Police officer who was off duty at the time of the accident.

Byrd said a blood sample was taken from Snyder and "alcohol may be a factor, but we won't know that until we get the results back."

According to Byrd, the emergency call of the incident came in at 6:42 p.m. on Friday.

"She and a friend were walking on Pointe aux Chenes just east of Noble," Byrd said. "She was wearing a red shirt and dark sweat pants. The driver said he didn't see her. The driver realized he hit something, turned around and came back and saw it was a human."

Braun was taken to Ocean Springs Hospital and Byrd said he received the call just after 1 p.m. today that she had died.

Byrd said investigation of the incident is ongoing.

Ocean Springs Superintendent Bonita Coleman-Potter said Braun was a 10th-grade student at Ocean Springs High School.

"We are trying to reach out to the parents and at the same time be sensative to the timing," Coleman-Potter said. "It's always a real shock to lose any of our children."

Coleman-Potter said the school district will have grief counselors at the high school Monday morning "to help us get through this difficult time."
