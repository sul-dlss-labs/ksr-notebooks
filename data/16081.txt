The drunken-driving suspect killed Friday night during a traffic stop in Fridley was a 31-year-old New Brighton man.

Sam Matthew Holmes struggled with Lino Lakes Police Sgt. William Owens during a traffic stop and attempted arrest on Interstate 694, according to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.

Owens reportedly used a stun gun on Holmes, who returned to his car and tried to drive away. The officer pursued him, and was being dragged by the car when the officer fired his gun and fatally struck Holmes, the BCA said.

Owens was treated at Regions Hospital and released for his injuries.

The officer was working as part of a DWI enforcement effort Friday when he pulled Holmes over for speeding. Owens tried to arrest Holmes for warrants and suspicion of DWI when the suspect reportedly struggled and tried to flee.

Court records show Holmes had been convicted of DWI after a 2012 arrest.

Owens has been a Lino Lakes police officer for nine years, the BCA said. He is on administrative leave while the BCA investigates the shooting.
