BENTON, Ill. • A high-speed chase involving a Kentucky man and officers from multiple agencies ended Tuesday when the man was fatally wounded by police after he fired several shots, according Illinois State Police Lt. Michael Alvey.

Joshua Moreno, 38, of Bowling Green, Ky., was the man fatally shot.

About 3:03 p.m., the Franklin County, Ill., Sheriff’s Department received a report of a residential burglary, police say. Witnesses reported the suspect leaving with multiple firearms. Alvey said officers located the suspect and began pursuit at 3:06 p.m.

During the pursuit, the suspect hit a deputy’s vehicle after refusing to stop and fired at officers, Alvey said. The suspect’s vehicle then became disabled on Interstate 57, and he carjacked another motorist and continued to flee.

Alvey said the pursuit continued south of Benton, where the suspect left the vehicle and continued to fire at officers. He said multiple departments responded, and the suspect was eventually shot by officers and pronounced dead by Franklin County Coroner Marty Leffler.

Several police cars had Illinois Route 37 south of Benton blocked off for several hours. Benton is about 100 miles southeast of St. Louis.

The loss of life in the incident was tragic, Alvey said.

“Our sympathies are with the family and Benton community,” he said. “This incident underscores the importance of good citizens willing to make a difference and report suspicious behavior.”

Alvey said there were no known injuries to anybody in the community or to any officers.

The incident is under investigation by the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office and the state police, he said.

Authorities did not take additional questions during a news conference outside of the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, citing the investigation.
