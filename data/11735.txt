SHELBY – The sheriff’s office has released the identity of a suspected bank robber found dead inside a rural Shelby County home after a standoff with authorities Thursday that lasted for more than four hours.

Shelby County Sheriff Mark Hervey said Larry Tiarks, 48, of Avoca died from a self-inflicted wound.

Authorities began a pursuit shortly before noon Thursday after reports of a robbery at the Shelby County State Bank branch in Shelby.

Hervey said an on-duty Shelby County deputy was in Shelby at the time of the robbery and saw a vehicle leaving the city that matched the suspect’s vehicle.

A pursuit ensued and law enforcement chased the man east from Shelby to a home in the 200 block of Juniper Road, which has an Avoca address.

Bank employees reportedly told investigating officers that the robber did not display a gun during the robbery. It was unknown how much, if any, money was taken during the robbery.

Officers from at least five counties, the FBI, the Iowa State Patrol, the Department of Transportation and the Harlan Police Department surrounded the home for more than four hours. Repeated efforts to contact the suspect were unsuccessful.

Chain Electric crews were working near the home repairing power poles damaged by an ice storm in 2008. The men said they did not know what was going on when dozens of law enforcement vehicles flew past their job site.

After going to lunch, they could not return to their job site.

An Iowa State Patrol Tactical Entry Team entered the home shortly after 4 p.m. and found Tiarks dead. Authorities said none of the officers who had surrounded the house had fired a shot during the incident.

Hervey said the bank robbery is still under investigation.
