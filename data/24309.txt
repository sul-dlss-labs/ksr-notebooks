DENVER, CO â€“ The Denver police bike patrol officer who shot a man as he allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in June will not be charged, the Denver District Attorney's office said.

A gun battle ensued on June 13 in the 500 block of East Colfax after Carnell Nelson, 29, allegedly stole a cash register drawer from the convenience store. A clerk saw Nelson enter the store and pull out a gun and ran out, flagging down two Denver police officers passing on their bikes around 7:50 p.m. He told them Nelson had a gun.
