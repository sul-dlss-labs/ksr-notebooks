Police have identified that man who was killed after being hit by an Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department cruiser on the east side Thursday night.

IMPD said the victim was 49-year-old Richard Moore. According to police, Officer Jason Rauch was traveling south on Emerson Avenue toward the intersection with 42nd Street when Moore stepped into his path. It happened around 9:30 p.m.

Police said Rauch had a green light when Moore stepped off the curb. Investigators said the officer tried to take evasive action, but couldnâ€™t avoid hitting the victim. Moore died from his injuries.

The officer was on duty, but was not responding to a call; his lights and sirens were not running. The initial investigation showed neither alcohol nor speed appeared to be a factor in the crash.

An onsite test administered to Rauch showed he had a blood alcohol content of .000. A blood draw was also performed, although those results were not available.

Rauch has been with IMPD since 2008, and has faced no disciplinary action, the department said.
