A man driving a stolen U-Haul truck died early Thursday after ramming a police car in a wild chase in California — then jumping into the San Francisco Bay, according to a report.

The unidentified driver and a female passenger initially escaped California Highway Patrol (CHP) officers chasing him on a highway shortly after midnight, KTVU said.

When the stolen U-Haul was spotted again, the driver rammed a squad vehicle and then started driving the wrong way up a one-way street, officials told the outlet.

He eventually fled on foot and jumped into the bay near the city’s Third Street Bridge, the report said.

A CHP officer leaped in after him, and found him unconscious, the report said. He was taken to a local hospital but was pronounced dead.

It was not immediately clear what happened to the woman who had been his passenger, the report said. There was no mention of injuries to any of the officers involved.
