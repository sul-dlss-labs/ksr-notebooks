A man who died while in San Diego police custody last week has been identified as 36-year-old Bertrand Martin, the Medical Examiner’s Office said Wednesday.

Martin was being booked into jail at the downtown police headquarters downtown about 11:45 p.m. on Sept. 15 when he complained of leg pain and said he was having trouble breathing, San Diego police said.

He died while paramedics were attending to him.

Martin had been arrested earlier in the evening in Clairemont on suspicion of attempted burglary after a resident at an apartment building on Longford Street said he saw Martin on his enclosed patio looking into the windows of his home, police said.

Martin ran away when the man confronted him but the resident and several others caught and held him until police arrived.

The resident told police that Martin punched him in the neck. People who called 911 reported that men were arguing and fighting in the street, and that a man was on the ground.

Martin complained of pain in his legs and was taken to a hospital where he was treated and released before being brought downtown.

Investigators with the Medical Examiner’s Office said the cause of Martin’s death is still pending.
