A man who was shot during an altercation with Santa Ana officers late Sunday night has died, police confirmed Monday.

Officers spotted a white pickup truck parked in front of a business near the intersection of Edinger Avenue and South Sullivan Street about 11:30 p.m. and attempted to contact the driver, Santa Ana Police Department Cpl. Anthony Bertagna said.

The driver got into a physical altercation with police, resulting in an officer firing a Taser at him, Bertagna said.

It was unclear what impact, if any, the Taser had on the man and an officer involved shooting occurred a short time later, Bertagna said.

The man was struck and taken to a local hospital, where he later died, Bertagna said.

Bertagna identified the driver as a Hispanic man in his 30s. It was unclear if he was armed.

An officer injured during the altercation had to be hospitalized, but was expected to be released Monday morning, Bertagna said.

Investigators said the man shot by police did not own the truck, and they were searching for the owner.
