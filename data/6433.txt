John Rico, 30, a Latino man, was shot in the head by a Los Angeles police officer at 5243 Huntington Drive North in El Sereno, and died at 9:31 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 9.

Police gave this account: Two LAPD Hollenbeck officers were called to a domestic violence incident. The alleged victim, a pregnant woman, told them the suspect--Rico--had left the scene. The officers were still investigating the report when Rico came back and allegedly choked one of the officers, a male officer whom officials did not name. The officer became incapacitated, police said. His partner, Officer Jeanette Flores, 32, shot Rico, who died at the scene.

The officer who was choked was later treated and released at County-USC hospital for a head injury. Flores injured her hand, and was treated and released at Good Samaritan Hospital.
