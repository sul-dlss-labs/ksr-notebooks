A man is dead after he was shot by Vermont State Police officers in Poultney.Officers were called to a home in the 1700 block of Finel Hollow Road Thursday afternoon for a report of a domestic incident.The alleged victim told police her fiance, Michael Battles, 32, physically assaulted her and threatened to kill her.The woman said she ran from the home but Battles chased her and assaulted her again in a neighbor's yard.One witness told police the victim was dragged to the ground and assaulted.Another witness reported the victim said Battles beat and choked her.The woman suffered injuries to her body and face and received treatment.A state police officer responded to assist a Rutland Court Sheriff's deputy.Police said Battles refused to leave the home. They reported he said he had an arsenal in the house.The officers said Battles then showed what they believed was a gun.Multiple agencies then responded and a standoff ensued.Battles said he had nothing to live for and that the standoff would not end well, according to state police.A negotiator was called in about 11 p.m. to try to get Battles to leave the home.Just after midnight Friday, a judge issued a search warrant for the home. An arrest warrant was also issued on an aggravated domestic assault charge, with bail set at $100,000.About 1:40 a.m., police said they broke down the front door of the home and Battles stepped onto the porch.They said he appeared agitated and did not comply with the negotiator's orders.He was believed to have said “guess you will have to shoot me," according to police, and then went back inside the house.Around 2 a.m., police said the saw Battles holding a flashlight in a window of the home as if it were a gun.When he appeared again, police said he had a silver revolver and pointed it at them.Troopers then fired multiple shots at Battles and he fell to the floor.He was pronounced dead at the scene. His body was taken to the Chief Medical Examiner's Officer in Burlington.An autopsy done Saturday morning indicates Battles sustained a single gunshot to the head, causing his death. Police said the cause of death has been ruled as a homicide. Police said they found a silver revolver in Battles' right hand and what appeared to be a another gun in a holster on his hip. Upon inspection, police said determined they were BB guns. Five troopers fired shots at Battles. It was not immediately known how many times he was hit.Battles did not appear to have fired any shots at the officers.Investigators said Battles had an extensive criminal record and was prohibited from owning guns. He was on probation stemming from several charges resolved in March.Police said their investigation into the fatal shooting was ongoing. Their findings will be turned over to the Rutland County State’s Attorney and Attorney General’s Office for independent reviews.The troopers who fired shots have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Their names are Sergeant Lyle Decker, Trooper Matthew Cannon, Trooper Eric Vitali, Trooper Christopher Brown, and Trooper Michael Anderson.
