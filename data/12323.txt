CYPRESS PARK (CBSLA.com) â€” Interstate 5 reopened Friday morning following a pursuit that ended in a deadly crash.

The suspects, traveling in an SUV, refused to stop for police and led them on a pursuit.

"The pursuit occurs only for about two minutes. They are unable to keep up with the vehicle because they are driving at such a high rate of speed," Sgt. Rudy Lopez said. "Ultimately, the suspect vehicle enters the freeway where it loses control, cutting across three or four lanes, hitting the freeway support, turning on its side, spinning five to six times."

The SUV collided with a mini van on the northbound 5 Freeway. A male robbery suspect in his 20s died in the crash, police said.

The driver of the mini van and one robbery suspect were transported to a local hospital in unknown condition, according to officials. The third suspect was arrested.

The California Highway Patrol shut down the Golden State Freeway at Pasadena Avenue for almost six hours and reopened it just before 8 a.m.
