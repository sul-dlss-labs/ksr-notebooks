GREENFIELD — An Indianapolis man has died after he was shocked with a Taser stun gun Friday night by police in Greenfield, according to the Indiana State Police.

Sgt. Rodney Vawter and Officer Dillon Silver with the Greenfield Police Department responded to a call at about 6:30 p.m. about an intoxicated man lying in the grass near the 800 block of South State Street found Douglas A. Wiggington, according to releases from Indiana State Police and Greenfield police.

When Wiggington became combative, according to State Police, the Greenfield officers shot him with a Taser.

“When police arrived, he was belligerent towards them, uncooperative for the most part,” said Sgt. Trent Smith, the public information officer with the Indiana State Police’s Indianapolis post.

Police soon saw that Wiggington was experiencing medical issues, so they gave him Narcan and began CPR, the release stated. Wiggington, 48, died after medical personnel took him to Hancock Regional Hospital, according to the release.

Smith did not provide details or say whether officers noticed if Wiggington was in medical distress before he was shot with the Taser. Smith said the incident is still being investigated by State Police.

“I can tell you that officers are trained to try to recognize as best as possible the condition of the individual, before they use any kind of, obviously, weapon or Taser or major stuff like that,” Smith said.

At this time, the officers are on administrative leave, which is department protocol, according to the Greenfield police’s release.

An autopsy will be held Sunday to determine the cause of death, Smith said.
