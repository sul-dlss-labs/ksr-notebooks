Illinois State Police are investigating the fatal shooting Saturday of a man by an Orland Park police officer responding to a domestic disturbance.

James N. Hayes, 47, died at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn after being shot twice in the chest by a 20-year veteran officer who also serves as a firearms instructor, said Orland Park Police Chief Timothy J. McCarthy.

Officers responded to Hayes' residence in the 15700 block of Brassie Court at 6:18 a.m. after his wife called to report the man was threatening to blow up the 12-unit condominium where they lived.

"She said he was intoxicated," McCarthy said.

Hayes had barricaded himself in his condo, turned on gas appliances and distributed other combustible substances elsewhere in the building, police said. As officers tried to evacuate the building, Hayes tried to burn them with a makeshift flamethrower, authorities said.

Hayes then moved to his balcony to confront an officer who had climbed up a ladder. Hayes tried to force the officer off the third-floor balcony. The officer repeatedly demanded Hayes surrender and then, fearing for his own life, shot the suspect, McCarthy said.

Helen Wood, who lives in the condominium, said she heard Hayes yelling early Saturday before police told her to evacuate.

"I can't imagine what sprung this all of a sudden, why he went off the deep end," Wood said.

The Cook County medical examiner's office had not issued an official cause of death.

The officer is receiving counseling and has been placed on administrative leave until the state police complete their investigation, McCarthy said.

"It appears, at this point, that it was a justified shooting," McCarthy said. "There were three eyewitnesses who said the officer had no choice but to fall over the balcony 20 feet below to an asphalt parking lot or shoot the suspect."
