A Salem police officer is on paid administrative leave after fatally shooting an armed 27-year-old man threatening to kill himself on Sunday.

Chase Hammer, of Salem, died after being shot by Corporal Ryan Demmer just before 8 p.m., outside a home in the 3700 block of Scenic View Drive Southeast, police said. Officers were responding to a call from Hammer's girlfriend about an hour and a half earlier reporting Hammer was depressed and had a firearm.

Salem police said Hammer was shot when he refused to drop the firearm when asked by officers. State police are investigating the incident.
