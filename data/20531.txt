LYONS, Ill. (WLS) -- Illinois State Police said they are investigating an officer-involved shooting Friday evening in southwest suburban Lyons.

"I just saw the cops shooting at the guy and I heard a bunch of gunshots, like 20 of them. Too many, I just wanted to get out of there," said Brooke Obradovich, witness.

"I looked outside and I saw a police officer running up to the car, next thing I heard gunshots," said David Morrone, witness.

State police said they were assisting the Sycamore Police Department with a homicide investigation in the far west suburb. While looking for a suspect, they found him driving a vehicle and began to follow, traveling about 50 miles east.

"The guy who was running, they were trying to box him in. He crashed directly into the police officer," said Bryon McPherson, witness.

State police said they followed the suspect all the way to Lyons, where he began firing at officers near the intersection of Ogden Avenue and Joliet Road. Officers returned fire and fatally wounded the suspect, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

"Then you heard the police return fire," McPherson said. "Sounded pretty rapid, like automatic gunfire."

In the middle of dinner rush, people poured out of the Lyons restaurants to find more than two dozen bullet casings.

State police did not identify either the homicide victim or the suspect who was killed, pending the notification of their next of kin.

The officer-involved shooting also remains under investigation, and the intersection was shut down for hours.
