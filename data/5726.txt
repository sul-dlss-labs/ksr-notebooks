Reported By: Lee Peck

It was 1:20 in the morning on December 12th, that an SUV driven by Calcasieu Parish Sheriff deputy Joshua Foch ran off the Interstate 2-10 near Legion Street. The vehicle flipped several times down this embankment, ejecting two people in the back seat, one of them being 23-year-old Jerica Devillier, who was penned under the SUV and died about 12 hours later.

Following the accident, 20-year-old Foch was arrested and charged with DWI and vehicular homicide. His blood alcohol point level was .11. Two other deputies were in the vehicle. One was treated and released with minor injuries, the other, Deputy Jarred Malone, was also ejected. Deputy Malone had been in guarded critical condition at Memorial Hospital since the accident, until his death around 3 o'clock Saturday afternoon. Malone was 27 years old.

Calcasieu Parish Sheriff Tony Mancuso released this statement late Saturday evening: "It is truly a tragedy deputy Malone's life was cut short at such a young age. He was a fine deputy who loved his job and did it well. He will be sorely missed by everyone at the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office. To deputy Malone's family Mancuso said: "We extend our prayers and heartfelt sympathy to Jarred's family during this very difficult time."

Deputy Jarred Malone's Funeral Arrangements:

Visitation begins at 1 p.m. on Wednesday at Johnson's Funeral Home . The funeral is scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday at Trinity Baptist Church on Country Club road with burial to follow at Highland Memorial gardens.

Deputy Foch remains free on $25,000 bond and again will likely face additional charges. We're told Lake Charles Police Chief Don Dixon will address that issue on Tuesday.
