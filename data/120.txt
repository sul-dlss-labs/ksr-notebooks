The city has agreed to pay $2.25 million to the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed black security guard who was fatally shot by a Hispanic detective three years ago, concluding a civil suit in a case that became a volatile symbol during the Giuliani administration.

The killing outside a West Side bar was seen by some as an emblem of concerns about racism in law enforcement and of the temperament of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. He refused at first to meet with the victim's family or to express sympathy and released Mr. Dorismond's sealed juvenile arrest record, saying he did so to show that the victim was not ''an altar boy.''

Yesterday, the city's lawyers issued a statement describing the March 16, 2000, shooting of Mr. Dorismond as a tragedy and repeating the conclusion of a grand jury that no one intended the gun to go off.

''The city continues to feel deep sympathy for the Dorismond family on the accidental death of their son and father,'' said the statement from Muriel Goode-Trufant, the chief of the City Law Department's special federal litigation division. The statement continued, ''Under all the circumstances,'' it was appropriate to compensate Mr. Dorismond's family. Mr. Giuliani eventually said he had made a mistake in not clearly expressing sympathy.
