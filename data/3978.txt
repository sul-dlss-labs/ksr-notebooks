Police officers involved in a Southwest Side shootout Friday that left a 15-year-old Summit boy dead were justified in their use of lethal force, officials said Monday.

A police roundtable discussion determined that the officers acted within department guidelines, said Chicago police spokesman Pat Camden. Herman Medina of the southwest suburb was killed in the shooting after a traffic chase.

Police said a tire iron was found near Medina after he was shot, but officers had taken fire from the vehicle and were justifiably in fear for their lives.

Also Monday, Juvenile Court Judge Anthony Iosco heard details of the case as it related to a 14-year-old charged in connection with the shootout and Medina's death.

The teen, one of two passengers in the vehicle, has been cited in a juvenile petition with charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder, according to the Cook County state's attorney's office. Iosco declined to release the teen to family members and ordered him to reappear in court again Tuesday.

Police have said the Friday incident began with the mugging of a 13-year-old boy near 64th Street and Pulaski Road. At about 8 p.m., a cell phone and gold chains were taken from the youth, who reported the robbery to his parents and told them about the offenders' vehicle.

Police began searching for a white sport-utility vehicle that was believed to have been involved, officials said, and located it in the area of the robbery. Its occupants fled in the vehicle after officers identified themselves, police said.During the chase, shots were fired at police from the SUV, police have said.

The chase ended in the 6700 block of South Lawndale Avenue, with what police have described as a shootout.

The driver of the vehicle, Medina, was fatally shot as he got out of the vehicle, Camden has said.

Officials said the third teen in the car, who was wounded, is not expected to face charges.
