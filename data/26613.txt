A 36-year-old man was shot and killed by Nassau County police officers in Oceanside Tuesday night after police say he lunged at the officers with a sword.

According to police, the officers responded to a home on Columbus Avenue just after 6 p.m. for a domestic incident. The man, whom police have not identified, was involved in an argument with his father and sister, and had multiple knives on him. According to Newsday, the man had a history of mental illness.

Police say the officers were interviewing the man's father when he entered carrying multiple knives, and then a samurai sword. The officers gave him many orders to drop the weapon police said, but the man did not. He then lunged at the officers with the sword. Both officers shot him.
