A Baton Rouge man accused of striking and killing another man during a 2017 police chase that reached speeds of nearly 120 mph was charged Thursday with the stiffer crime of manslaughter after he rejected an offer to plead guilty to vehicular homicide.

As part of that offer, the East Baton Rouge Parish District Attorney's Office would have dismissed two drug charges against Reginald Weeden, prosecutor Kathleen Barrios said in court. He would have been sentenced to 30 years in prison.

Now, the 33-year-old Weeden faces up to 40 years in prison on the new manslaughter charge. He had been scheduled to stand trial next week on the vehicular homicide charge that he no longer faces.
