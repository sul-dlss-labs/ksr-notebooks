The Newton County Sheriff's Department is investigating a deadly, two-county police pursuit involving a driver deputies say refused to pull over.

The fatal wreck happened Monday night on County Road 503 near Union.

Neshoba County Sheriff Tommy Waddell tells Newscenter 11 the pursuit started in his county when deputies tried to pull over a vehicle that was allegedly stolen in his jurisdiction. The driver refused to stop.

Sheriff Waddell says at one point, his deputies lost sight of the driver but continued the pursuit into Newton County. Waddell says his deputies then pulled up to a crash site and noticed the vehicle had left the road, went airborne and crashed into a wooded area.

The driver in the deadly crash has been identified as 37-year old Christopher Cleveland.

Multiple agencies are involved in the investigation.
