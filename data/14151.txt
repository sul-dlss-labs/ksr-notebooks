Kenny Clinton Walker, a 23-year-old black male, was shot to death by a Los Angeles police officer March 6 behind a home in the 9600 block of South San Pedro Street in Broadway-Manchester, according to the Los Angeles County coroner’s office.

Shortly before 5 p.m., officers from the Los Angeles Police Department’s Southeast Division were in the area of East 97th and South San Pedro streets investigating two drive-by shootings that left one person dead, according to a department news release. Douglas Henry Wooley, a 27-year-old black man, was shot and killed at 97th and South Main streets that morning. Wooley was killed after someone got out of a vehicle and opened fire.

Officers approached Walker, who was armed with a handgun, behind the home in the 9600 block of San Pedro Street, according to Det. Frank Alvelais of the LAPD’s Force Investigation Division.

Alvelais declined to say what prompted one officer to open fire, citing the ongoing investigation. After Walker was shot, he was taken to a hospital, according to police. He was pronounced dead at 6:25 p.m., according to the coroner.

No officers were injured, and a firearm was recovered at the scene, according to the LAPD release.

Alvelais said it was not clear whether Walker was linked to the earlier shootings in the neighborhood.

The officer who shot Walker has been identified as Police Officer Jonathan Vander Lee, according to Alvelais, who said Vander Lee was the only officer to open fire.
