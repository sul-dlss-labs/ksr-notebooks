A 27-year-old man who died after jumping into a Pompano Beach canal while being questioned by deputies had a federal warrant for his arrest, the Broward Sheriff’s Office said.

Authorities say Gerdle Moise, of Margate, drowned early Monday after running from deputies who were questioning him while they patrolled the area near McNab Road and Andrews Avenue. Deputies were making rounds there because of a recent spate of burglaries, investigators said.

Moise and Jarrod Clark, 31, of Pompano Beach, were riding bicycles about 11:15 p.m. Sunday and carrying flashlights, according to the sheriff’s office. Deputies stopped to question them.

Moise had a woman’s coin purse in his waistband and darted off during the encounter with deputies. He was not under arrest or in handcuffs when he bolted, the sheriff’s office said.

Clark stayed behind, cooperated with authorities and was later charged with loitering and prowling.

When Moise ran off, a deputy chased after him, tried to stop him with a stun gun, but Moise instead cut through the parking lot of St. Henry Catholic Church, stripping off his clothes along the way.

Moise jumped into a canal behind the church, swam out several feet and disappeared shortly after surfacing once, the sheriff’s office said. The deputy jumped into the canal and tried to rescue Moise, but couldn’t find him.

The sheriff’s dive team found his body about 12:15 a.m. Monday. The deputy was taken to the hospital as a precaution after swallowing some canal water.

Federal court records show Moise had an outstanding warrant for violating the terms of his supervised release following a three-month prison sentence for passing counterfeit money. He allegedly failed to report an arrest by Coral Springs police on a charge of possession of a weapon or ammunition by a convicted felon.
