A man who was fatally shot by police following a pursuit from Banning to Palm Springs on Thursday, Oct. 14, was identified as an Idyllwild man Tuesday, Oct. 19.

Russell Leggett, 30, shot at a Banning police officer at a traffic stop on State Route 243 Thursday morning, disabling the officer’s vehicle, according to Sgt. Albert Martinez of the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department.

Leggett then fled in an older-model green station wagon, ultimately heading east on the 10 Freeway, prompting a pursuit that included officers from the Banning, Beaumont and Palm Springs police departments and the Sheriff’s Department, Martinez said.

Leggett allegedly fired at officers several times during the pursuit, which ended when he exited the freeway and came to a stop on the North Indian Canyon Drive off-ramp, where a shooting occurred involving him and pursuing authorities, Martinez said.

Details of the shooting were not released, and it was unclear if Leggett opened fire on authorities, or which officers or deputies fired at him.

A standoff ensued, with the armed suspect still in the car and sheriff’s deputies and Palm Springs police deploying armored vehicles to the scene. Eventually, authorities approached the vehicle and found Leggett dead inside, along with a rifle, according to the sheriff’s department.

No deputies or officers were injured.

All deputies and officers involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative leave per their respective department’s policies, according to Martinez.
