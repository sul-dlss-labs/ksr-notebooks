LATTA, S.C. -- The investigation into a Latta crash in which two people died and a third was injured continues.

The crash happened Saturday on Griffin Road shortly after a South Carolina Highway Patrol trooper attempted to make a traffic stop.

The trooper had just activated his blue lights when the car sped off, Capt. Cliff Arnette, Dillon County Sheriff's Office said.

Arnette said sheriff's office investigators, who are investigating the fatal crash, were still gathering information and couldn't yet say why the trooper had decided to make the traffic stop.

It was unclear if the trooper pursued the car prior to the crash, Arnette said.

Dillon County Coroner Donnie Grimsley identified the victims as driver as Charles Frederick Page, 37, Latta, and passenger Johnathan Vereen, 20, of Latta.

A third person is in a Florence hospital recovering from injuries suffered in the crash.
