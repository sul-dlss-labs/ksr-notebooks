Santa Barbara Sheriff deputies fatally shot Kerry Flood, 52, at a mobile home park in Orcutt.

The deputies were called to the scene at 12:19 p.m. after reports that a man wearing only a towel around his waist was screaming and behaving in a bizarre manner. Flood allegedly began attacking the deputies with a cinder block.

“During the violent confrontation, the deputies attempted to subdue the man using their Tasers, but were unsuccessful,” the press release stated. “As the attack continued, one of the deputies suffered a serious head injury before the suspect was eventually shot.”

Flood was pronounced dead at the scene. One of the deputies was transported to Marian Medical Center.

Both deputies will be placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.

Flood was visiting his mother at the Cherry Hill Road mobile home park.
