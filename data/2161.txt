A Harrision County grand jury ruled Friday that a sheriff's deputy was justified in shooting a Saucier man on December 19th, but it wasn't the deputy's bullets that killed 40-year old Robert Carnley.

According to the grand jury report, Carnley died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after exchanging shots with Deputy Oneil Adams.

Earlier that day, Carnley checked his son out of Saucier Elementary School and threatened to harm himself and the 10-year-old child. Deputy Adams spotted Carnley's truck and followed it to his Scarborough Road home.

The investigation revealed when Adams confronted Carnley, he again threatened the boys life, and started shooting at Adams. The deputy shot Carnley six times. Carnley's son was not injured.
