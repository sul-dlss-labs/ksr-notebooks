Edmund Wong, 40, a Latino man, was shot repeatedly by Downey police officers at 9404 Pico Vista St., and died at 4:03 p.m. Friday, April 6.

The confrontation took place at about 3:35 p.m. Sheriff's investigators said Downey police responded to a call of a man with two guns getting into a silver pickup truck. They tried to stop the truck, but it accelerated, racing away for a short distance before making a U-turn and crashing into a patrol car. Wong got out, pointed what appeared to be a gun, and officers shot him, sheriff's deputies reported. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Two pellet guns designed to look like handguns were recovered, they said. No officers were hurt.

Investigators said later that Wong had recently split with his girlfriend. He called police and gave them a meticulous description of himself, and said he was armed with a gun, and came to meet the police when they responded to the call.
