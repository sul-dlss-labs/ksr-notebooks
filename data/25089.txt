SCOTT TOWNSHIP -- The Columbia County district attorney has ruled that police were justified in shooting a man over the weekend. The victim, Jonathan Young, died Wednesday at the hospital.

Officers went to the home on Jonathan Young Sunday to serve a mental health warrant.

Investigators say young barricaded himself inside the home for an hour before police broke in.

One officer used a Taser on young, but it did not stop him.

According to the D.A., Young came at an officer with a hatchet and a baseball bat.
