A Tampa woman speeding away from police after breaking into her former boyfriend's Sarasota home crashed into a house early Saturday and killed a 62-year-old woman sleeping inside, authorities said.

Killed was Eleanor Ball, an avid volunteer in her community and church who had received several honors for her work, according to media reports. She had worked at Sarasota Memorial Hospital for more than 30 years, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reported in 2012.

"Good-hearted person," her grandson, Steve Walker, told Bay News 9. "She is going to be greatly missed you know."

The incident began about 3:30 a.m. in the 1700 block of 29th Street in Sarasota.

Investigators said Jakeilah R. Weeks, 24, who lists a W Spruce Street address in Tampa, broke into the Sarasota home of an ex-boyfriend.

Sarasota police, responding to calls of a domestic situation and break-in, arrived just as Weeks was fleeing, they said.

Officers on foot ran after her car as it sped away and watched as she crashed into a home in the 1700 block of 32nd Street. Police said her car went through the side of the house and into a bedroom.

Ball was sleeping, police said, and died at the scene.

Weeks was taken to a hospital and treated for injuries. She was later booked into the Sarasota County Jail, where she was being held without bail.

She faces charges of vehicular homicide, burglary, petty theft, resisting an officer without violence and two counts of battery.

Jail records list her as a customer service representative, and her booking photo shows her head wrapped with a bandage.

State records show that Weeks had been arrested once before in Florida. In 2009, she was charged with trespassing and resisting an officer without violence. She pleaded no contest to both crimes and adjudication was withheld, records show.
