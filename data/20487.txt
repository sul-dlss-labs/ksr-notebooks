A 44-year-old West Allis man apparently committed suicide by forcing a police officer to shoot him Thursday night.

A West Allis police officer shot and killed Gordon Velyov, 44, after he pointed a gun at several officers. Police later found a suicide note in Velyov's home, West Allis Deputy Chief Michael Jungbluth said Friday.

Jungbluth said a man believed to be Velyov called 911 at 7:41 p.m. Thursday and reported a "crazy" person with a gun.

When officers arrived, they heard what they thought were gunshots in Velyov's home and blocked off the area.

Velyov came out, pointed a handgun at his head and challenged officers to shoot him. When officers told him to drop the gun, he pointed it at them.

One officer shot and killed Velyov, who died at the scene.

Velyov had been having personal and financial problems for several weeks, Jungbluth said.
