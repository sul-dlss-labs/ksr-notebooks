The passenger was listed in good condition yesterday at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore, but police refused to release his name while the investigation continues.

The chase began Saturday afternoon, when a detective saw two men, whom he suspected of drug activity, in the Jeep on Merritt Boulevard, police said.

The men fled and fired several shots at police while leading them through residential streets. At Holabird and Monumental avenues, the Jeep ran a red light and was struck by a pickup truck, police said.

County police spokesman Bill Toohey said tests on the service weapons of police involved in the chase show that the officers did not return fire.
