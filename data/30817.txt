One person was killed and four people were wounded Tuesday in Chicago.

The fatal shooting involved a murder suspect from California who was shot after opening fire on Amtrak police at Union Station around 5 p.m., according to Chicago Police.

The man saw uniformed officers waiting for him on the platform and took off running, officials said. One of the Amtrak officers returned fire and struck the man and he was pronounced dead at a hospital. An Amtrak employee suffered minor injuries, and an officer also was taken to the hospital for evaluation, officials said.

A person was in custody after a man was wounded in North Center. A 25-year-old man was driving north about 2 p.m. in the 4200 block of North Western Avenue when a car pulled alongside and someone inside fired shots, Chicago police said.

He was shot in the arm and was taken to Swedish Covenant Hospital in good condition, police said.

Officers placed a suspect into custody shortly afterward and recovered two weapons, police said.

Three others were wounded in shootings citywide.

Sixteen people were shot Monday in Chicago.
