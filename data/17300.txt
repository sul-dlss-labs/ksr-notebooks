ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (KRQE) – New details have been released in the shooting death of a 23-year-old man killed by a deputy U.S. Marshal.

The Albuquerque Journal reports that it was a single shot that killed Edgar Camacho-Alvarado at a mobile home park in February.

An autopsy report released Wednesday says that Camacho-Alvarado was hit in the armpit. The report says the bullet traveled across his body before making its way to his chest.

According to the Journal, the report ruled Camacho-Alvarado’s death a homicide.

An attorney for his family says they may file a lawsuit, and the family is also ordering an independent autopsy.

Back in February, Deputy U.S. Marshals say they were looking for a suspect on the state’s most wanted list.

Investigators say Camacho-Alvarado flashed, then pointed a gun at a deputy who then fired off four shots.
