A 43-year-old Portland man died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head this morning in a rear shed of his home after Portland police, working with federal agents, raided his house and fired at least one shot at him as they tried to take him into custody on federal drug charges, police said.

Members of Portland's Gang Enforcement Team serving a federal search warrant burst into Derek J. Coady's home at 12612 S.E. Holgate Blvd. shortly before 6 a.m.

One of the team's officers fired at least one shot at Coady, who was to be arrested on a federal drug indictment.

Police said officers ordered Coady to put down his gun when they confronted him in the back of his house. They saw him duck behind the front of a parked car on his property, and were concerned that the car would give him a "vantage point to possibly shoot at officers,'' Sgt. Brian Schmautz said in a prepared release.

One officer fired at least one round at Coady. A short time later, police heard a gunshot and members of the Portland police tactical squad, the Special Emergency Reaction Team, found Coady dead inside the shed behind his home.

With help from the state medical examiner's office, investigators concluded that Coady shot himself when surrounded by police.

His home was one of 17 locations federal and local law enforcement officers raided early today as part of a federal drug investigation. Coady faced federal indictment on drug charges, but federal officials declined to release more information about the investigation.

It was the second police officer-involved shooting in Portland in 32 hours, draining police and detective resources. A flood of federal agents and Portland police detectives were at the scene most of the day. Holgate Boulevard, from Southeast 122nd to 128th Avenue, was closed to traffic .
