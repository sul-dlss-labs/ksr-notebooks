San Jose police are trying to find more about what led to a fatal police chase and crash last week.



Adrian Gamboa, 20, was killed in the Feb. 17 crash about 11 p.m., after police pulled over the SUV he was driving in near Capitol Expressway and Towers Lane. Police say that the SUV tried to run over the officer, but the officer was able to jump out of the way without getting hurt.



The officer then chased the SUV onto southbound U.S. Highway 101 towards Blossom Hill Road. But the SUV refused to stop, police said, and the driver turned off all its lights in an attempt to escape the officers.



Gamboa eventually lost control of the vehicle and crashed near the 5400 block of Monterey Road in South San Jose. He was pronounced dead at the scene. Two passengers were treated for non-life threatening injuries. Further investigation revealed the vehicle suspect Gamboa was driving was reported stolen out of San Jose.
