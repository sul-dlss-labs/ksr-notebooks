Overview

Lori Renee Knowles called 911 for help. “I took too many pills, and I need help right now,” she’s heard screaming into the phone during her 911 call. Her husband Ken was rushing to their Henry County home to help her, and also called 911. “She is bipolar and she takes medication. She told me she took too much of her medication,” Ken pleaded. “Please don’t hurt her.” But his pleas were too late. Police had already shot his wife, just seconds before his call. They had forced their way into the home when Lori didn’t answer the door. She allegedly had a gun at her side and the officers claim they tried to get her to comply with orders to show her hands, but she made an offensive movement towards the weapon.
