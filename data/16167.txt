No criminal charges will be filed against the Carrollton police officer who shot and killed a man after repeatedly asking him not to touch his weapon, the district attorney said Thursday.

“The officer acted in a reasonable manner under the circumstances and was justified in using deadly force in self-defense,” DA Peter Skandalakis wrote in an emailed statement. “For this reason, I have decided that no case will be presented to the Carroll County Grand Jury.”

On May 28, a 911 caller reported a suspicious man near an ATM on Bankhead Highway, and Cpl. Chad Cook responded to the area. Cook met with the man, 40-year-old Kenneth Joel Dothard, and the two spoke for about eight minutes, according to audio released by the GBI.

During the conversation, Dothard admitted to carrying a handgun without license and previously being convicted of a felony. When Cook called for additional officers, Dothard became upset and reached for his gun.

Things quickly escalated, with the officer screaming orders at the man to not touch his gun, according to the audio.

“Don’t take that gun out or I’ll shoot you!” Cook shouted.

“I have authority…” Dothard replied.

Seconds later, the officer fired two shots, striking Dothard in the head and killing him.

The GBI investigated the shooting and turned over its findings to Skandalakis, DA for the Coweta Judicial Circuit.

“After examining all of the evidence and consulting the applicable statutory and case law, I have determined that no further action is warranted in this matter,” Skandalakis said.
