The incident took place at approximately 4:20 p.m. in front of the Landmark Lodge Motel in the 7500 block of Camp Bowie Boulevard West, where members of the task force attempted to serve a robbery warrant.

As officers approached, police said the suspect pulled out a firearm, so the officers fatally shot the man.

The Hood County County Sheriff's Office said the shooting involved 53-year-old David Glen Watson, who was suspected of aggravated robbery last Sunday in Cresson.

Hood County investigators, along with the Texas Rangers, had collected enough evidence to charge Watson with the robbery and were searching for him on Friday when they located him at the motel.
