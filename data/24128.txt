LEAGUE CITY, Texas – A man was shot and killed by officers Tuesday during a raid at a home in League City after he wielded a samurai sword and threatened officers, according to authorities.

The raid happened just before 5 a.m. at a home in the 300 block of Morningside Drive.

According to League City police, the department’s Combined Agency Response Team was serving a search warrant for narcotics and illegal weapons and entered the home.

Police said Roger Fortner, a resident, threatened officers with a samurai-style sword. Officers said that when Fortner did not put the weapon down, League City police Officer Andrew Gilbertson fired a blunt impact projectile and Officer Matt Maggiolino fired his rifle.

Fortner, 49, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officer Kelly Williamson, with League City police, said that there were multiple people inside the home at the time.

Brandon Wilson, 20 and a resident, was charged with possession of marijuana and possession of a controlled substance. Wilson was arrested. His bond was set at $20,000.

Gilbertson is a 6-year veteran of the League City Police Department, while Maggiolino has spent the last five years of his 14-year law enforcement career with LCPD.

No officers were injured, police said

Neighbors in the area said that they woke up to the sound of gunshots.

“It was like a big 'bang,'" said resident Andy Wilkerson.

Nicole Jackson said she was asleep when she heard the noise.

“It was a like a big 'boom,'" Jackson said. "Later on, we saw all of the police and cars."

The officers involved have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure after this type of shooting, police said.
