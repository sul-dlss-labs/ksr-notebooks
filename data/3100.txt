RAWLINS (AP) - An independent investigation has exonerated a Wyoming Highway Patrol trooper who fatally shot a man on Interstate 80.

The shooting happened near Elk Mountain on Jan. 20.

Trooper Robert Garner acted in self-defense, Carbon County Attorney David Clark said in a letter delivered to the patrol's chief, Col. John Cox, on Thursday.

Clark said he arrived at the decision after reviewing a report by the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation.

Responding to a report of a drunken driver, Garner pulled over Keven Wade Hanson, 42, of Draper Utah.

According to the report, Garner saw an empty pistol holster on the front passenger seat and did not get a straight answer whether Hanson was armed. After Garner got Hanson to get out, Hanson started moving toward the trooper and Garner sprayed him with pepper spray.

But Hanson continued to advance, pulling a pistol and pointing it at Garner until the trooper shot him six times. Garner then reloaded and withdrew from the lights of his patrol car.

"He heard the driver fire shots at some point in time, and upon his return with assistance, found the driver dead or dying from gunshot wounds," the letter said.

"The driver was still functioning at the time the trooper left the immediate area and the head wound would have likely rendered him unconscious immediately."

Two spent shells from the driver's gun were found at the scene.

The Attorney General's Office also plans to review the report and two more DCI interviews related to the shooting are planned.

"Those items and interviews do not appear to contain information that would prevent me from making my decision concerning any possible criminal prosecution," Clark wrote.
