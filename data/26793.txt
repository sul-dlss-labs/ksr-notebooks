A veteran New Jersey correction officer was killed early Saturday when the driver of an allegedly stolen car slammed into his vehicle during a wild pursuit, according to a police union and a report.

“Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family of Officer Omar Martin from Northern State Prison,” the New Jersey State Policemen’s Benevolent Association Local 105 wrote on Twitter.

“He was killed early this morning by a driver of a stolen vehicle involved in an active police chase. He was taken [too] soon and our blue family is devastated,” the union said.

The chase began when a Hillside, N.J., cop started following a Nissan Altima with three men inside, the state attorney general’s office told NJ.com.

The Nissan fled, ultimately slamming into Martin’s Ford Mustang near the intersection of Bragaw Avenue and Aldine Street in Newark around 2:37 a.m., sending it careening into a utility pole.

Martin was trapped in his car and pronounced dead on scene, authorities told the outlet.

He was a long-serving correction officer, working out of the Northern State Prison, William Sullivan, executive vice president of the union, said.

“He was well-liked by everybody,” Sullivan said. “Nobody could say anything bad about him. He was just one of those all-around nice guys.”

“Lost a good officer today,” Tommy Brennan, who identifies himself as a law enforcement professional, wrote on Twitter. “Godspeed my brother!”

Two men riding in the Nissan car were hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries.

The third was brought to the Hillside Police Department, the attorney general’s office said.

Their identities were not immediately released and an investigation is ongoing.
