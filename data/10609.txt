A man who jumped into a canal while fleeing police Saturday afternoon has died, Lauderhill police spokesperson Constance Stanley confirmed.

Police recieved a call just before 6 p.m. that there was narcotics activity happening at the U-Save convenience store at 4039 Northwest 19th Street, she said.

When an officer engaged 23-year-old Winston Gaskin at the scene, he took off running and plunged into a canal, according to police -- but only made it about halfway across before he began to struggle.

"The suspect swam for a little bit" before he began to drown, Stanley said. "At the time, [officers] called paramedics and they assisted in pulling him out of the canal, performing CPR until the paramedics arrived."

Gaskin was treated on the scene and then transported to Florida Medical Center in critical condition, police said. He was prounounced dead shortly before midnight.

"The police later found out that Mr. Gaskin did have an arrest warrant out for cocaine possession," Stanley said, "so that could be the reason that he fled."
