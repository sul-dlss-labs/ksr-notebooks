JACKSON PARK â€” A relative of a 5-year-old who drowned last summer after falling off a rock ledge at Jackson Park Harbor sued Chicago police, alleging that an officer prevented bystanders from trying to rescue the boy.

The lawsuit, filed Monday in Cook County Circuit Court, contended that the officer threatened to arrest bystanders who were "suitably qualified" to attempt a rescue of Ronald Evans Jr. in July.

If the good Samaritans had been allowed to enter Lake Michigan, "they could and would have rescued" the boy, the suit said.
