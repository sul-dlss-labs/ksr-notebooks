The all-white deer in the Prairie State Outdoors section of Friday’s paper is not protected by law.

The photo clearly shows the dark tarsal gland on the deer’s left rear leg, hence the deer is not “all white.” This was the excuse the Department of Natural Resources used to refuse to ticket the bowhunter who killed “Al,” the all-white white tail buck who roamed the Lick Creek area of Spaulding Orchard road a few years ago.
