A man is dead after threatening suicide during a standoff with law enforcement and then apparently shooting himself accidentally.

It started with a domestic dispute on Green Road near Slocomb.

Geneva County Sheriff Tony Helms says the man tried to abduct a woman at gunpoint but she managed to get away and call 911.

Slocomb Police, state troopers and deputies from Geneva and Houston County surrounded the home.

Negotiators tried to talk the man into surrendering as held a shotgun to his throat.

Sheriff Helms says the man appeared ready to give up when he stumbled and the gun went off, killing him.

The manâ€™s name has not been released pending notification of relatives,
