One person was killed and two others — including the 15-year-old driver — were injured Saturday morning, Nov. 28, when a car crashed at the end of a pursuit, the Hemet Police Department said.

The identities of the car’s occupants were not immediately available Saturday, nor were the ages of the passengers.

The pursuit began about 7:50 a.m. after an officer saw a white Toyota sedan headed east in the 1700 block of W. Florida Avenue, police said, that matched the description of a car stolen in Desert Hot Springs and was later spotted in Hemet.

The officer confirmed that the car had been stolen and pulled it over in the 2000 block of W. Acacia Avenue. But moments after officers began giving the three occupants instructions to surrender, the car sped away with police in pursuit, a news release said.

As the car headed east on Devonshire Avenue, it ran a stop sign at Lyon Street and swerved to avoid another car, the release said. The car skidded onto the sidewalk and rolled several times, ejecting a passenger, before striking a tree. The pursuit covered about three-quarters of a mile, Lt. Eric Dickson said in an interview.

That passenger died at the scene. The driver and front-seat passenger were hospitalized and were expected to recover.

There is a felony no-bail warrant out for the arrest of the driver on suspicion of burglary, Dickson said.
