Two Orange County sheriffâ€™s deputies shot and killed a man Monday after he threatened them with a knife, the department said.

Gerber Jimenez, 20, was fighting with his sister at an apartment in the 33700 block of El Encanto Avenue, authorities said. When the deputies responded to a 911 call about 5:30 a.m., Jimenez lunged at them with a knife, Lt. Steve Kea said.

Both deputies fired at Jimenez.
