TUSCUMBIA, Ala. -- Authorities say several Mississippi and Alabama bank robbery and burglary investigations are essentially closed since the prime suspect has died in a Tupelo, Miss., hospital, the TimesDaily newspaper reports.

Asa Nakeen Warren, 25, S. Cave St., Tuscumbia, died Friday at North Mississippi Medical Center from injuries sustained in a car crash Nov. 10, said Carolyn Gillentine-Green, coroner in Lee County, Miss.

Warren was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Vida DeShondrell Byrd, 25, Washington Avenue, Tuscumbia, that crashed on U.S. 72 near Iuka, Miss., while they were trying to elude police after a bank robbery in Corinth.

Byrd died at the scene.

Tuscumbia police said while detectives were investigating recent burglaries and robberies in the city, Warren's name was mentioned often for his possible involvement. Tuscumbia police Sgt. Stuart Setliff told the TimesDaily that Warren was a suspect in at least 3 burglary cases.
