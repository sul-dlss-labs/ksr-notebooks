Jack Schlesinger, a 25-year-old white man, was shot and killed by LAPD officers Tuesday, Sept. 28, in the 1600 block of West Temple Street in Westlake, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Shortly after 4:30 p.m., three officers patrolling the Echo Park neighborhood came upon a suspicious-looking vehicle. A check of its license plate revealed that the car had been reported stolen and the suspected thief was thought to be armed and dangerous, said LAPD Assistant Chief Earl Paysinger.

The officers stopped the car where Schlesinger exited and turned toward the officers; he was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle or similar weapon, Paysinger said. Two officers opened fire, killing Schlesinger, he said.

Paysinger said that along with the rifle, a handgun was discovered in Schlesinger's back pocket.

It was not immediately known if Schlesinger fired on the officers, Paysinger said, and investigators were working to determine details of the pursuit and the shooting.

Aerial news photographs appeared to show a black rifle on the ground next to Schlesinger's body, which had been lifted by officials onto a gurney and covered with a sheet.

Westlake ranks 40th highest for violent crime per 10,000 residents among the 211 areas patrolled by the LAPD or Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department analyzed in The Times new interactive database, Crime L.A.

Since January 2007, at least 140 people have been killed by police officers in Los Angeles County, according to coroner's data collected for the Homicide Report.
