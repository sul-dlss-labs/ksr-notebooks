A 39-year-old man was shot and killed by Newark police just minutes into the new year Friday, according to the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office.

The shooting occurred just after midnight in the city’s South Ward, near South 11th Street and Woodland Avenue, officials said.

The attorney general’s office has opened an investigation into the police-involved shooting, but has not released the name of the man who was killed, the identity of the police officers involved or any other details about the incident.

The Newark Department of Public Safety, which oversees the city’s police, deferred comment to the attorney general’s office.

The attorney general’s office is investigating the incident under a law enacted in 2019 that requires an investigation any time someone dies during an encounter with New Jersey law enforcement officers, state officials said.

The last time a Newark police officer shot and killed a person was in 2019, when Officer Jovanny Crespo fired into a fleeing car, fatally wounding one man and critically injuring another. Crespo was indicted for manslaughter.
