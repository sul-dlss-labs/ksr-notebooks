Talking Rock, Georgia (September 20, 2020) – On Saturday, September 19, 2020, at approximately 11:40 a.m., the Georgia Bureau of Investigation was requested by the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office to conduct an officer-involved shooting investigation.

The investigation revealed that at approximately 11 a.m., the Pickens County 911 Center received a trespass call at a residence in Talking Rock, Georgia. The subject was identified by the 911 caller as Derek Cooper, 52, of Acworth, Georgia. The caller indicated there was a restraining order against Cooper and that Cooper attempted to kill his wife during a domestic incident this week. Cooper was in fact out on bond for the domestic violence incident with conditions of no contact with his wife and children. The wife, children and another family member were hiding inside the residence.

The Pickens County Sheriff’s Office responded to the residence to find Cooper in the back yard. A deputy gave Cooper verbal commands at which time Cooper brandished a firearm and fired at the deputy. Cooper then attempted to make entry into the residence by force and armed with a gun. The deputy fired at Cooper, striking him. Lifesaving measures were performed on Cooper by deputies until Pickens County Fire Services arrived to take over his care. Cooper was transported to an area hospital for treatment where he died as a result of his injuries. The autopsy with the GBI Medical Examiner’s Office is pending.

The involved officer was not injured in this incident.

Upon completion of the investigation, the case will be provided to the Appalachian Judicial Circuit District Attorney for review.
