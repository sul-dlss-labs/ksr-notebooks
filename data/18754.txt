Officials have identified Gary Mark Wigley,52, as the man who was shot and killed during an armed confrontation with law enforcement in Bulloch County Monday night.

Deputies from the Bulloch and Effingham counties were serving an arrest warrant about 11:15 p.m. at a home in Brooklet when Wigley, who was at the residence, ran away toward an abandoned mobile home, the local GBI office said in a statement.

The deputies, who were later identified as Sgt. Reynaldo Rodriguez of the Bulloch County Sheriff’s Office and Sgt. Gary Provost and Deputy Nathan Singletary, both of the Effingham County Sheriff’s Office, chased him, and they told the GBI that they saw him pointing a long gun at them.

Deputies told the man to drop the gun, but he did not, according to the GBI. He was shot and killed during the confrontation. Medics were called to the scene, but the man was dead when they arrived. No officers were harmed.

Preliminary results of the autopsy revealed that Wigley died as a result of gunshot wounds. The final autopsy report is pending additional testing, GBI officials said.

The warrant being served during the incident was a bench warrant in reference to felony charges from Effingham County.

The GBI is investigating the use of force by officers. Once the GBI completes its investigation, results will be turned over the Ogeechee District Attorney’s Office, where prosecutors will decide whether or not any charges are warranted.
