REEDSPORT, Ore. (AP) - The Oregon State Police has identified a Reedsport man fatally shot by law enforcement last week as 71-year-old Glenn Ray Glancey.

Lt. Gregg Hastings says Glancey lived in the mobile home park where the shooting occurred last Thursday. He died from his injuries three days later.

Officers from Reedsport and the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office confronted Glancey after responding to a disturbance at the park.

Hastings says Glancey had a handgun and exchanged shots with the officers.

The investigation remains active. Hastings says that when it’s over, the findings will be turned over to the Douglas County District Attorney’s Office for review.
