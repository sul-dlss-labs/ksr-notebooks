DES MOINES, Iowa â€” The Pleasant Hill officer who pursued a 14-year-old boy in a high-speed car chase did not contribute to the boy's fatal crash.

That's the conclusion this week from Polk County and Pleasant Hill authorities.

Christopher Stephens died August 9th after crashing his foster mother's van on Iowa Highway 163.

Police Sergeant Steven Johns began pursuing the van, which the foster mother said was stolen by Stephens after an argument at their Pleasant Hill home.

Stephens lost control of the van and crashed, landing about 40 feet from the wreckage with severe head trauma and lacerations.

Officials say Johns followed proper pursuit procedures and did not contribute to the accident.

They say Stephens presented too much danger to the public to simply let him go.

Stephens struck at least two vehicles, sped through traffic signals and went up to 90 miles per hour before he crashed.
