MAURY CITY, TN (KFVS/WBBJ) - A suspect was shot and killed by police after a chase starting in Pemiscot County, Mo. ended in Crockett County, Tenn.

Tommy McCoy Jr., 22, was shot and killed after he led police on a chase, according to Kristen Helm, the public information officer with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.

McCoy almost hit an officer in Pemiscot County who was directing traffic at the scene of a fire on June 23.

Family members tell WBBJ-TV that McCoy was on probation in Missouri, and ran away from officers because he didn't want to go back to jail.

The Pemiscot County Sheriff's Department chased McCoy into Tennessee where the Crockett County Sheriff's Office got involved.

The chase ended near 5606 Highway 88 near Maury City when McCoy ran on foot and was shot by a Crockett County Sheriff's officer around 11:15 p.m. on Saturday.

McCoy's father told WBBJ-TV that he watched from his own kitchen window as his son was shot and killed late Saturday night.

"The officer was standing 10 feet away from my son, and shot him in the back, and killed him instantly," said Tommy McCoy.

McCoy's family says he was not armed. TBI did not say whether McCoy was armed or not.

The TBI is investigating the details leading up to the shooting.

The medical examiner will conduct an autopsy on McCoy. Evidence gathered at the scene will be submitted to TBI's Crime Lab for processing. It will most likely take several months before the investigation is completed and reviewed by the district attorney, according to the TBI.
