Plainclothes police officers on patrol at a Brooklyn housing project early yesterday shot and killed an ex-convict who was carrying a pistol, the police said.

Police officials would not say why officers confronted the man, Montique Smalls, 39, outside 423 Baltic Street in the Gowanus Houses in the Boerum Hill section, shortly after midnight.

They said that when Mr. Smalls ran from the police, three officers and a sergeant, all in plainclothes, chased him about 150 feet into the courtyard of the housing complex. When Mr. Smalls turned and ran toward two of the officers, the police said, the sergeant and the two officers fired a total of 10 rounds. One round struck Mr. Smalls once in the upper right leg, apparently hitting a major artery.

He was taken to the Long Island College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 1:26 a.m.

Mr. Smalls lived in the housing complex, at 417 Baltic Street, the police said. A .380-caliber pistol was found next to his body, the police said, but it was unclear last night whether officers saw him pointing the gun at them before they fired.
