Investigators are looking into a deadly Taser incident outside an apartment complex in Waller County.

Just before midnight, officers were dispatched back to the same location for another 911 hang-up. Hempstead officers were aware that one of the persons involved had been previously issued a criminal trespass warning at that location.

Hempstead officers observed the person to be at said location in violation of the criminal trespass warning and attempted to place the person under arrest. The suspect allegedly resisted arrest and broke free and began running away from officers.

It first began at 9pm when Hempstead police were called to the Willowchase Apartments on Fifth near Allen Street, in reference to a 911 hang-up. When officers arrived they learned that the parties involved in the disturbance had left the area.

“The suspect fled. He was chased by officers, was tased and the suspect did not recover,” said Hempstead Police Chief David Hartley.

Police say only one officer deployed his Taser, but at least two charges were deployed. Officers noticed that the man was having difficult time breathing and called for assistance. Waller County EMS began CPR immediately and transported the suspect to Bellville General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The 22-year-old victim hasn’t been officially identified, but family members say his name is Terrell Houston.

The officer’s name has not been released. He has been placed on adminstrative leave with pay pending the outcome of the investigation.

Both Hempstead police and the Texas Rangers are investigating the incident.
