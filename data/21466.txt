HENRY COUNTY, Ind. -- One person died after a crash following a police chase on I-70 in Wayne County, Indiana.

The crash happened around 10:30 a.m., in the westbound lanes of I-70 west of Richmond, Indiana.

A deputy with Henry County pulled over a Cadillac on I-70, near the 129 Mile Marker around 10 a.m. State police say the deputy suspected the driver, 30-year-old Daniel Walter Lynn of Colorado, was impaired, so he was asked to step out of the vehicle.

Lynn put the car into drive and drove eastbound on I-70 and the deputy chased him, officers said.

A few miles later, the Cadillac jumped the median and hit a westbound GMC pickup truck driven by Fred Haller of Ohio. Lynn was pronounced dead at the scene.

Haller and his wife were injured. She was airlifted from the scene with more serious injuries, police said.

The westbound lanes of I-70 were closed until about 1 p.m.
