Four people have died from two separate vehicle collisions that took place on Highway 101 near Winchester Canyon early Wednesday morning.

At 2:14 a.m. and 2:25 a.m. the Santa Barbara County Fire Department received reports of two separate vehicle collisions on Highway 101 northbound. The first collision was near Winchester Canyon and resulted in the fatality of one occupant. The second collision resulted in three fatalities.

Three fire engines, one truck company, and a Battalion Chief responded to both incidents where extrication of the victims was required. The vehicle in the second collision also caught fire and crews had to extinguish it before retrieving the victims.

Both collisions are under investigation by law enforcement and further details are not known. Although, edhat scanner reporters state at least one of the collisions involved California Highway Patrol pursuing a suspect vehicle heading northbound who then moved into the southbound lanes.

One lane of northbound US Highway 101 is closed from Winchester Canyon Road to Dos Pueblos Road following a multi-vehicle accident this morning. The southbound lanes of US 101 remain closed until approximately 12 noon, according to Caltrans.

This is a developing story.
