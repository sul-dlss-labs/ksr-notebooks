A 25-year-old man is dead after a late-night altercation with officers just north of Thomas Road on 37th Street.

The incident began around 4 p.m. when a mother called police to report that her son, Dylan Papa, was arguing with her and was armed with a large sword. The man fled before officers arrived and police searched the area, but could not locate him.

Papa was found to have an outstanding felony warrant for his arrest.

The woman called police again around 10 p.m. saying her son returned and was in a nearby apartment threatening people with a knife. She said he had also assaulted a man.

Officers spent an hour talking Papa out of the apartment and when he exited, he had a large hunting-style knife tied to his hand. Police say Papa charged at officers and when non-lethal methods didnâ€™t stop him, officers opened fire on the suspect.

The suspect died at the scene. No officers were injured.

This is the second deadly shooting involving Phoenix Police officers in 12 hours.

In the previous situation, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, one man was killed after reportedly robbing a bank, and firing at officers before he was eventually cornered near Baseline Road and Interstate 10.
