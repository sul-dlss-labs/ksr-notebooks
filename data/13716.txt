PRESCOTT, Ariz. (AP) - Prosecutors have cleared a Prescott police officer in the fatal shooting of a knife-wielding man.

The Daily Courier reports (https://bit.ly/1gUeCN7) the Yavapai County Attorneyâ€™s Office says it found no evidence of any wrongdoing by Officer Jared Willis in a November 2013 shooting.

Authorities say Willis was responding to call that 44-year-old Larry Clay was acting suicidal and intoxicated.

Willis told investigators that Clay ignored several calls for him to drop the two knives he was carrying.

Willis says Clay then quickly charged at him while holding the knife blades up, resulting in Willis shooting Clay three times.

In a nearly 300-page report conducted by the Arizona Department of Public Safety, prosecutors say Clay appeared to want to commit suicide by cop.
