The man, who was described as in his 20s, was found dead in the back of the tavern with a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Clark County Sheriff’s Office officials on the scene. He was not identified.

Deputies said that the standoff began when the man came into the tavern at 2928 Lake Road and threatened the owner. The owner reportedly told the man to leave, and when he refused the owner escaped from the building, locked the door and called law enforcement.

Deputies used loudspeakers to order a man to come out with his hands up, and family members also were trying to talk him into surrendering. Officers also said they used a drone and a small, wheeled robot with a camera attached to enter the building.

After catching glimpses of the man, deputies called the Springfield Special Operations Team.

The man barricaded at least one door, officials said.

Springfield Police, the Springfield SOT, Clark County Sheriff’s Office and Ohio State Highway Patrol all had units on scene.
