NEEDLES >> Sheriff’s deputies killed a Highland man, who had indicated he wanted to hurt himself, after the 50-year-old pointed a pistol at a deputy, the Sheriff’s Department said Saturday.

Jackie Brand was reported missing by his friends and family after he left work early Friday.

“Brand made statements to friends indicating he was intending to harm himself,” deputies in Grand Terrace learned when they took the missing person’s report, according to a Sheriff’s Department statement.

Deputies in Needles “were requested to contact Brand and check on his welfare” after he was located in the 4100 block of Needles Highway about 4:30 p.m. Friday.

Brand brandished a loaded 9-millimeter handgun and refused deputies orders to drop it, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

“Brand pointed the handgun directly at a deputy, forcing the deputy to use lethal force against Brand,” the sheriff’s statement said.

Brand was pronounced dead at the scene.

Sheriff’s detectives are investigating the deputy-involved shooting.
