NEWARK — Authorities have identified the 19-year-old armed robbery suspect who was shot and killed Tuesday by a Newark police officer during a confrontation. A photograph of another suspect still wanted in connection with the same robbery was also released.

Jahad Phillips, of Newark, was fatally shot by the officer as he was being pursued as a robbery suspect, Essex County Acting Prosecutor Robert Laurino said in a statement today.

Newark police said Phillips was shot after he charged toward a police cruiser with a gun drawn, shortly before 1 p.m. The shooting happened on South 13th Street near West Side Park, where police interrupted the suspected robbery. Phillips lived a few blocks away, on South 14th Street. Efforts to reach his family were unsuccessful.

Phillips’ alleged accomplice, Raheem Walker, 20, of Newark, is still wanted in connection with the same shooting. The prosecutor’s office released a photograph of him today. Walker has been charged with robbery, conspiracy and weapons offenses.

The shooting is being investigated by the Newark Police Department Internal Affairs Unit and the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office Professional Standards Bureau. The case will be presented to a grand jury as required under attorney general guidelines in all police-involved shootings, the prosecutor’s office said.

Police said Phillips, who was trying to flee the area that day, ran toward a marked Newark police vehicle with a gun in his hand. An officer fired a single shot as Phillips came close to the passenger side window of the police vehicle, striking him in the torso, police said.

Authorities have not identified the female officer who fired the fatal shot.
