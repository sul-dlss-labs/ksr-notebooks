GADSDEN, Alabama -- Gadsden Police are continuing to look into the circumstances around the shooting deaths of two people Saturday when Etowah County deputies attempted to serve warrants on one of them.

According to police reports, the incident began around 12:20 p.m. at the Holiday Host Motel, 2464 East Meighan Blvd. County deputies, working with the Glencoe Police Department, came to Room 135 at the motel to serve warrants on Sasha Nicole Tarvin, 26, of Attalla. Inside the room, along with her, was Justin Scott Colvin, 36, of Gadsden, who was described as her boyfriend.

According to Sheriff's Office Spokeswoman Natalie Barton, Tarvin had three felony drug warrants.

Deputies said while they were attempting to make verbal contact with Tarvin, they heard a shot inside. They called for backup, set up a perimeter and then heard another shot about 12 minutes later.

Members of the Etowah County Joint Special Operations Group were called in with tactical weapons to secure the area and attempt negotiations. However, they could not make contact with anyone inside the room. Using a camera, they looked inside the room and did not detect any movement. JSOG deployed no offensive weapons.

When the door to the room was breached, officers found Tarvin inside the bathroom, dead of a gunshot wound to the head. A few feet away in the bathroom doorway, they found Colvin also shot in the head but still alive. He was carried to Gadsden Regional Medical Center, where he died that afternoon.

Gadsden Police Capt. Bobby Jackson said there is a strong possibility that Tarvin committed suicide, then Colvin used to same gun to kill himself. At first, detectives believed Colvin shot her, then turned the gun on himself.

"Autopsies on both individuals will be performed sometime today and hopefully will help provide clarification," Jackson said.
