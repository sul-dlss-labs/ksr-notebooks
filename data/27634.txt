LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — One man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in a residential neighborhood in Henderson. Police said in a briefing held Saturday that the suspect was shot and killed by officers after yielding a knife.

Around 12:10 p.m., officers were called to reports of a violent domestic battery involving a weapon at a residence near Gibson Road and the 215 Beltway.

Once police arrived, they located a man who was armed with a knife in front of a house in the neighborhood. Officers on scene used low-lethal options, but they were ineffective.

“The male continued to aggress officers resulting in an officer-involved shooting,” Henderson Police said.

Despite police using life saving measures, the man succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced dead at the scene.
