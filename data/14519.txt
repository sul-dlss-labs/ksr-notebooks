LUCEDALE, Mississippi -- A George County Sheriff's deputy shot and killed a rifle-wielding man Monday night while responding to a domestic dispute, according to authorities.

Department spokesperson Shonna Pierce said a statement would be released shortly on the incident that occurred about 8:30 p.m. on Monday.

"An officer responding to a domestic violence call at approximately 8:32 p.m. hours Monday night has resulted in the death of one man," was the extent of Sheriff Dean Howell's statement.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and the District Attorney's office are now handling the case, the release also said.

MBI spokesman Warren Strain said the department got the call about 9 p.m. of an officer-involved shooting in George County.

"The sheriff asked is to take a look at it and we had investigators on the scene last night," Strain said. "It's still real early in the investigation. They are still looking into everything so there's not a lot we can release at this time."

Strain said there was a domestic violence call "initially" at 133 Blackberry Lane in Lucedale, though he noted the residence is out in the county.

Asked if the victim had a gun, he said that was part of the ongoing investigation.

The victim's identity, nor the deputy involved, have not been released.

Pierce said the deputy has been with the department since 2002 and has been placed on paid administrative leave according to department policy while an officer shooting is investigated.

"I can confirm that there was an officer-involved shooting in George County last night," said District Attorney Tony Lawrence. MBI is investigating. Due to the ongoing investigation, I am unable to make any further comments."
