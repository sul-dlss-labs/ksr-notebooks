Anchorage police on Friday released a photo of the two weapons police say 26-year-old Kenneth John used to threaten an officer before John was shot and killed on Monday.

The weapons are a 19-inch machete and a 10-inch hatchet, according to the department.

Police had previously refused to release a photo of the "bladed weapons" or describe them in detail, citing the ongoing investigation. Specifically, department spokeswoman Jennifer Castro said a more detailed description would not be released until detectives interviewed all potential shooting witnesses.

Detectives have spoken with those witnesses, she said Friday, while other potential witnesses are still being identified.

John is the cousin of Detlef Wulf, who was shot to death by police officers on April 5. Family members have questioned whether that shooting was justified.

Senior Patrol Officer Christopher Simmons found John's Chevrolet Blazer parked facing the wrong direction at about 6:30 p.m. on 12th Avenue near Hyder Street, Castro said. Castro said John got out of his vehicle and approached Officer Simmons, holding the hatchet in one hand and the machete in the other.

When he refused commands to stop, Simmons shot him, Castro said. She would not answer questions about the appearance, in the photo released Friday, of blood on the weapons or other details of the case.

"Investigation is still ongoing," she said.

John is the third person killed by city police so far this year.
