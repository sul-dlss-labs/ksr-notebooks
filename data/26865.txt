Milwaukee police are investigating a fatal crash in the Riverwest neighborhood.The crash happened at about 4:15 p.m. near Holton Street and Keefe Avenue. A 24-year-old man was killed, police said. A family member identified the man as Chance Coleman. His friends told WISN 12 News that Coleman was a soon-to-be father. "He was taken away, he has a new baby on the way and now he wont even meet him or her," said Penny Pane, a close friend of Coleman's. Milwaukee Police Department spoke to WISN 12 News on scene."Officers were on North Second Lane when they saw a suspicious vehicle parked southbound," Milwaukee police Inspector Daniel Thompson said. "As they passed the vehicle, they made a turn at the end of the block."Officers said the Hyundai driver sped off at a high rate of speed. The officers went around the block, went onto Keefe Street and went in the direction they believed the car was going and saw that the vehicle had crashed, Thompson said. The two people in the truck were treated at the scene. Family and friends initially believed Coleman's death happened because police were pursuing him. However, Inspector Thompson said officers never began a pursuit and only saw the car again after it had crashed. "At no point was it even attempted to be a chase because the accident happened so fast," Thompson said. WISN 12 News will update this story as more details become available.
