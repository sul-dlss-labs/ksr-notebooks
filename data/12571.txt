OAKLAND — A man fatally shot March 30 by an Alameda County sheriff’s deputy in the Fruitvale district after a vehicle stop turned violent was identified by authorities Thursday as Broderick Huggins, 32, of Modesto.

Authorities said the main reason for the delay in releasing Huggins’ name was that it took time to locate and notify his wife.

Authorities said Huggins was in Oakland with another Modesto man to buy marijuana.

Sheriff’s deputies stopped the Ford SUV the men were in at 33rd Avenue and San Leandro Street about 9:40 p.m. March 30 for an equipment violation. The passenger was arrested on suspicion of possession of the drug Ecstasy. His name was not released and he was eventually not charged with any crime.

After a second pair of deputies arrived as backup, Huggins refused to get out of the vehicle and drove off, dragging one of those deputies, who had been trying to undo Huggins’ seat belt, authorities said.

That deputy and another outside the car opened fire. Huggins was hit by the gunfire and later died.

The SUV ended up crashing into a building and a loaded pistol was found inside the vehicle, authorities said.

The deputy who had been dragged also suffered a bullet wound to his foot. Ballistics tests are still pending to see who shot him, authorities said. He is still recovering from his wound and will probably be off for some time, officials said.

The shooting is being investigated by the Alameda County District Attorney’s Office.
