Troopers said Jonathan Cruz sped out of an airport parking garage about 5 a.m. Saturday and would not pull over for an airport police officer, instead continuing onto eastbound I-80. The officer had just ended the chase under orders from a supervisor when he noticed a plume of dust ahead of him. He found the Volkswagen, upside down in the pond near the I-80 interchange to I-215 southbound. The three victims died inside the car.
