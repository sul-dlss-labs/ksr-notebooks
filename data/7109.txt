GASTONIA

Gastonia's police chief is defending the shooting death of a stabbing suspect by a police officer last week.

Police Chief Terry Sult said Tuesday it appeared that Detective Scott Barnes shot 20-year-old Terry Adam Boone in the back of the head last Thursday when he saw Boone stabbing someone.

Police say Boone stabbed four people.

Boone's mother, Debbie Keeter, questioned how the officer was threatened if her son was shot in the back of the head.

Sult says the location of the wound neither justifies nor invalidates the officer's action. He says the circumstances indicate that Barnes acted properly. He said Boone made an aggressive move toward Barnes.

The chief said the department and the State Bureau of Investigation are looking into the shooting. Barnes is on administrative leave.
