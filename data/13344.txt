PASCO — The Franklin County coroner says a man who stopped breathing as Pasco police arrested him last month died of a mixture of cocaine and alcohol.

Coroner Dan Blasdel ruled that the death of 35-year-old Ismael Maria-Acevedo of Yakima was an accident.

The Tri-City Herald reported he ran from officers Sept. 3 as they responded to a fight outside a Pasco nightclub.
