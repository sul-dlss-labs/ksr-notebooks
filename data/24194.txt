Two people are dead after a rollover crash Friday morning.

Police say at around 6:00 a.m., a car veered into the lane of a Northwood police cruiser on Wales Road. The police officer then turned around to pull over the driver. The driver fled, leading officers on a chase.

The car then went onto Lemoyne Road, into the Menards parking lot and rolled over the curb, landing on its top and hitting a curb and a tree.

The driver, identified as William Burgess, 51, and passenger, Kimberly Snavely, 50, were both killed in the crash. Officers say neither was wearing a seat belt.
