POTSDAM, N.Y. -- Authorities say a man fatally shot by police and the woman he stabbed to death inside an off-campus apartment were both graduate students from China.

State police on Friday identified the attacker as 31-year-old Tian Ma and the victim as 24-year-old Yazhen Jiang. They say both were pursuing doctorates at Clarkson University. Their hometowns were not initially available.

Officers in the village of Potsdam were called to the apartment around 2:45 p.m. Thursday for a report of an assault in progress. Troopers say that when officers arrived, they found Ma on top of Jiang, stabbing her and himself.

Police say one officer fired four shots at Ma after he refused to drop his knife.

Jiang was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The motive for the attack remains under investigation.
