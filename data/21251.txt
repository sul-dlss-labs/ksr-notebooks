A teenager is being charged as an adult in a car accident that killed a Detroit couple.

Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy says in a release Wednesday that 16-year-old Christopher Verge faces two counts each of second-degree murder, manslaughter with a motor vehicle, driving on a suspended license causing death, and fleeing police.

Worthy says Verge was driving a Dodge Ram that ran a red light Oct. 26 and slammed into a Pontiac Grand Prix on Detroit's northwest side. A man and woman in the Grand Prix were killed.

Worthy says it is "consistent with the continued rise in cases involving juveniles committing violent crimes."

Verge was expected to be arraigned in 36th District Court. The Associated Press could not determine late Wednesday if he had an attorney.
