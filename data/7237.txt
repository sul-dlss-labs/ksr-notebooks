Selma, Al. (WSFA) -- It was a tragedy state troopers have never experienced before. One of their own died while training to join the ranks of state trooper.

We all panic when we see those blue lights flashing in our rear view mirrors but state troopers do so much more than write tickets. That's why they have to go through more than five months of training to wear the trooper uniform.

And, marching at the end of the 22 weeks of training at the Alabama Criminal Justice Training Center in Selma is the pay off. But, one of the 40 who began the new class on Sunday won't be with the others when they graduate. Department of Public Safety's Col. Chris Murphy says "We at the Department of Public Safety are all saddened by the loss of one of our members even though he was a very new member, but we feel like we're family and the loss of Michael Johnston affects us all."

According to the Department of Public Safety, 25-year old Ervin Michael Johnston of Hoover collapsed Monday morning in a classroom. Shortly before that the recruits had been outside for physical training. The head of the Department of Public Safety went to Selma to talk with the recruits about the tragedy and Michael. "This is what he wanted to do. This is what he wanted to commit his life to. The best way we can honor that is for the staff to make true troopers out of the rest of those recruits and to keep going on, and the best way for those recruits is to graduate. I said I want to swear each of y'all in. I don't want to lose another recruit."

Michael Johnston was rushed by ambulance in critical condition to Vaughan Regional Medical Center in Selma and later air lifted to Brookwood Medical Center in Birmingham where he died at 6:30 Monday night.

The Department of Public Safety says it does not know the cause of death but an autopsy is being performed.
