From The Trussville Tribune staff reports

TARRANT — The Tarrant Police Department said a man killed after a crash in a police chase had a lengthy criminal history and should have never been on the streets.

Chief Dennis Reno said Anthony Terrane Gardner, 31, of east Jefferson County, had several warrants from several jurisdictions. The Trussville Police Department had a warrant for Gardner for a misdemeanor count of reckless endangerment.

The Tarrant Police Department attempted to stop Gardner on Thursday, July 18. Gardner attempted to flee and crashed at the intersection of Pinson Valley Parkway and Jefferson Boulevard. He was taken to UAB around 3:30 p.m. and was pronounced dead at 4:14 p.m.

Reno said Gardner was a danger to the community.

“He had 11 pages of criminal history,” Reno said. “Eleven pages! I mean, what was this guy doing on the street anyway? Why isn’t he in jail?”

According to court documents, Gardner had convictions of theft of property and burglary, and robbery, dating back to 2009. At the time of his death, he was also facing theft of property and burglary charges in another case.

“This guy should’ve never been on the streets and endangering our police officers, endangering our citizens or endangering anything else,” said Reno.

The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is investigating.
