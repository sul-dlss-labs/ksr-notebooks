A 34-year-old Simi Valley man who died in Newbury Park Saturday while trying to escape authorities on his motorcycle, led the California Highway Patrol on a pursuit that reached 100 mph, officials said today.

Larry Jason Wright was thrown from his motorcycle after crashing near Lynn Road and Rancho Dos Vientos.

About 10:50 p.m. an officer tried to stop Wright for speeding on the southbound side of Highway 101. Wright slowed down and started to yield on the Lynn off ramp and exited the freeway, officials said. But as he was about to make a right onto Lynn, Wright accelerated again in an apparent attempt to escape the officer and a pursuit ensued. Wright ran a red light at Reino Road and after passing Rancho Dos Vientos, rode into the opposing traffic lanes and crashed into a curb, officials said.

He was thrown from the motorcycle and sustained fatal injuries.

The crash is under investigation and an autopsy to determine his exact cause of death is scheduled for Tuesday.
