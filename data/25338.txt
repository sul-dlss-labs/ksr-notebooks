DES MOINES, Iowa — A man is dead after police say he stole a car and led officers on a chase.

It happened just before 3:30 a.m. Sunday morning. Des Moines police say an officer spotted a stolen Chevrolet near SW 9th Street on Watrous Avenue.

The officer attempted to stop the vehicle, but the driver took off. That started a short chase until the officer lost sight of the vehicle. Just a few minutes later, police received a report that the stolen car had crashed near SE 1st Court and Porter Avenue.

“The car had actually gone airborne, hit a telephone pole and then rolled though about two or three different yards. The speed was so great it carried the momentum that far,” says Des Moines Police Department Sergeant Paul Parizek.

The driver, who police identified as 24-year-old Henry Dameron of Des Moines, was taken to the hospital where he later died from serious injuries sustained in the crash. Dameron’s mangled car landed in the front lawn of Scotty Clyce. He had just brought his dog inside when the crash occurred.

“My room is right next, pretty close to where the car landed. So, I grabbed my girlfriend and my dog and we ran into the living room then called police,” Clyce says. “They told me it was a high speed chase and to stay inside my house.”

Police say they are also wanting to speak with the female passenger who bailed out of the car during the chase. They say she will likely not face charges but police are interesting in interviewing her.
