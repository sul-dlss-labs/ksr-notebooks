DOVER, Del. (AP) — A Delaware State Police trooper was justified in fatally shooting a suicidal man armed with a handgun during a confrontation after a domestic dispute last year, the state attorney general’s office says.

The Delaware Department of Justice said in a report issued this week that Cpl. Nicholas McLaughlin reasonably believed it was necessary to use force to protect himself and others when he shot Shane S. Swider on Nov. 29 outside a home in Lewes.

Officers responded to the home after a 911 caller reported a domestic argument in which Swider, 46, was armed with a handgun and talking about killing himself.

McLaughlin was armed with .223 caliber rifle and providing cover for Lewes police officers who were negotiating with Swider.

One officer told investigators that he heard Swider say that he was either going to kill himself or be killed by the police, and that he wasn’t going to go back to a behavioral health treatment center.

Investigators said Swider put the handgun on the ground at least twice but refused to move away from it. He then picked up the handgun and began raising it in the direction of McLaughlin and a Lewes police officer.

Audio from a police vehicle recording revealed that McLaughlin yelled “Stop!” before firing one round, striking Swider in the chest.
