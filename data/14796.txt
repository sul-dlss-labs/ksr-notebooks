HENDERSONVILLE – A Hendersonville man was shot and killed by police after he stabbed an officer, police say.

The altercation happened at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at an apartment at 146 Third Ave., Hendersonville police Chief Herbert Blake said.

Police shot Adrian Eugene King, 46, who lived in the apartment, after King stabbed police Sgt. Kenny Hipps in the stomach, Blake said. Hipps and K-9 Officer Jennifer Drake had gone to the apartment to investigate a report of a sexual assault.

“It was an unfortunate situation, and the officers did what they had to do based on their training and experience,” Blake said.

Blake declined to say who shot King or what may have led to the escalation of violence. In accordance with protocol in police-involved shootings, the investigation has been turned over to the State Bureau of Investigation, Blake said.

Hipps was taken to Pardee Hospital, then transported to Mission Hospital. He has undergone surgery and is expected to recover, Blake said.

“It’s not something we are used to,” he said. “It shows how unpredictable and dangerous police work can be.”

King had no criminal history in North Carolina, according to state public safety records.
