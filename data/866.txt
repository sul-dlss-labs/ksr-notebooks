A California Highway Patrol investigation has cleared a Brea police officer of any wrongdoing in an April traffic accident in which a man and woman died and two girls were injured.

The 50-page report by the CHP’s Fatal Accident Investigation Team concluded that the collision happened when Thomas Anthony Savas, 42, of Anaheim ran a red left-turn light at Esperanza Road and Fairlynn Boulevard in an unincorporated area near Anaheim. Savas’ 1997 Honda Accord hit the side of the patrol car of Officer Charles Croix, who was responding to a call. Savas and his mother, Sophie Savas, 66, of Yorba Linda were killed and his two nieces were injured.

Croix, a 16-year veteran, was injured and has not returned to work.
