St. Louis police are investigating an incident where an armed man entered a house early Saturday, refused to leave and was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police said the saga began when a 33-year-old woman was awakened by her alarm and noise inside her home in the 4200 block of Beethoven Avenue just before 2 a.m. She discovered a male acquaintance of hers had entered without permission.

The man, 36, pointed a gun at the woman and she ran out the front door of her home, police said. He stayed inside the home and refused police orders to come out. Negotiators and SWAT were requested to the scene. Once SWAT went into the house, they found the man dead. The man had suffered an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Police have not released a motive or the identity of the man. They referred to the incident as a burglary and unlawful use of a weapon.
