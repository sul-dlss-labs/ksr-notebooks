(CBS) – A grieving mother met with the head of the Chicago Police Department to watch video of officers fatally shooting her son in 2013.

It's the first time Supt. Eddie Johnson has invited the family of a suspect killed by police to come in and watch video of police actions.

It's an attempt at transparency by new top cop, but the family of Michael Westley maintains the police killed the teen for no reason.

For three years, Westley's mother has demanded to view the video. The viewing brought her no peace.

"They were in the wrong. He was running, and he did not have a weapon on him," Chantell Brooks tells CBS 2's Derrick Blakley.

Video from a city pod camera allegedly shows Westley, wearing gym shorts, running south on Sangamon with police in pursuit.

Shortly thereafter -- out of camera range -- police shot the 15-year-old, saying he pointed a gun at them.

A report by the Independent Police Review Authority says witnesses heard police call for Westley to drop a weapon. A nearby homeowner told IPRA he saw a gun on the ground near the teen's body.

Westley's family and supporters say the video tells a different story – that the youth was unarmed.

"We want justice for my son. We want this case re-opened," Brooks says.

She wants the U.S. Justice Department to investigate her son's death, and she says she may file a lawsuit.

The police superintendent offered condolences on her son's death, but no apology.
