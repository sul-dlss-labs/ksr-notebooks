Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 17300 Tomball Parkway

May 8, 2012 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed suspect by two on-duty HPD officers at 17300 Tomball Parkway (State Highway 249) about 2:15 p.m. on Monday (May 7).

The suspect, Richard Earl Davis, 26, of Houston, was transported to Houston Northwest Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.



Officers S.H. Nguyen and C.M. Oates, who discharged their duty weapons, were not injured in this incident. Officer Nguyen was sworn in as an officer in January of 2008 and Officer Oates was sworn in as an officer in June of 2008. Both officers are assigned to the Northwest Patrol Division.



HPD Homicide Division Sergeant T. Biggs and Senior Police Officer T. Miller reported:



Davis was distraught after losing his job several weeks ago. About two weeks ago, he obtained a pistol and threatened his girlfriend, leading to a warrant being issued for his arrest.



On Monday (May 7), Davis left his mother's apartment armed with a pistol. His mother and brother both tried to stop him and calm him down. Instead, Davis went to the above location where he approached his girlfriend, who was waiting at a bus stop, and pointed the pistol at her. Davis' mother then requested help from nearby HPD officers.



Arriving officers attempted to detain Davis who turned toward the officers while pulling the pistol from his waistband. Officers Nguyen and Oates, fearing for their safety, discharged their duty weapons, striking Davis.



After securing the pistol, the officers called for an HFD ambulance and began performing CPR until the EMS crews arrived. Davis was then taken to the hospital.



As is customary in HPD officer-involved shootings occurring in the city limits, this case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District District Attorney's Office.
