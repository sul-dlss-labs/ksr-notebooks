DAKOTA CITY, Neb. | A grand jury determined that the death of a man during a Nov. 3 traffic stop in rural South Sioux City did not involve criminal conduct, Dakota County Attorney Kim Watson said Wednesday.

An autopsy found that Matthew Ahlsten, 35, of Sioux City, died as a result of methamphetamine toxicity and that his death was accidental, Watson said in a release.

The grand jury was called to review the case because at the time of his death, Ahlsten was a passenger in a vehicle that had been stopped by police. Nebraska law requires that a grand jury be convened when someone dies in police custody or while being arrested.

The panel returned its finding Feb. 25.

A Nebraska State patrol officer stopped the vehicle at 7 a.m. Nov. 3 at U.S. Highway 20 and State Highway 110 and cited the driver for failure to signal. The driver's name has not been released.

Dakota County Sheriff Chris Kleinberg said in November the driver didn't know Ahlsten and was giving him a ride.

Officials said that during the stop, Ahlsten suffered a seizure and became unresponsive. An ambulance was called, but Ahlsten died at the scene.
