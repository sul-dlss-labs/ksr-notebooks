Houston Police Department > News Releases Incident at 4717 Meyerwood February 20, 2005 -- Houston police are investigating the in-custody death that occurred at 4717 Meyerwood on Friday, February 18, 2005, about 4:30 p.m. involving two Harris County Precinct One deputy constables. The deceased male has been identified as Joel Don Casey (w/m DOB: 2-18-53). HPD Homicide Division Sergeant M. Peters and Officer A. Palos reported: Harris County Precinct One Deputies G. Young and D. Gehring went to execute a mental health warrant on Joel Casey at the request of his mother. After Casey was informed he was going to be arrested and taken to a hospital, he began to physically resist the deputies' attempts to take him into custody. After Casey attempted to strike Deputy Gehring in the chest, Deputy Young used a taser on him. The deputies were able to handcuff Casey and place him into the deputy's vehicle. While inside the vehicle, Casey began to act violently, kicking at the vehicle's window. The deputies took Casey out of the vehicle and placed leg restraints on him. After being placed back in the vehicle, it was observed Casey was not breathing. He was taken out of the vehicle and CPR was initiated by the deputies at the scene. The Houston Fire Department responded and took over the lifesaving attempts on Casey. He was transported to Memorial Hermann Hospital where he was pronounced dead. The cause of death is being investigated by the Harris County Medical Examiner's office. As is customary in all in-custody deaths in the city limits, the incident is being investigated by the Civil Rights Division of the Harris County District Attorney's Office and the HPD Homicide Division.
