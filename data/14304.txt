HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (WHNT) – A Huntsville Police officer is in good condition and recovering after he was shot early Friday morning.

Officer Jason Moore was responding to a domestic violence call at 2024 Stanford Drive, just off Governors Drive in the city’s medical district.

The man accused of shooting the officer, William Arthur Stogner, Jr. is dead. He was 52 years old. Huntsville Police released his name at a late-morning briefing.

The initial call came in at 1:02 a.m. It was originally thought to be a fight between two men, in the street. However, police determined it involved a husband and wife. The couple’s children were not involved.

Huntsville Police Chief Lewis Morris said when officers arrived at the home, William Stogner came out with a long gun. Police told him to put the gun down and he shot Officer Jason Moore.

“There was a verbal confrontation, and he fired on the officers,” said Chief Morris. “The officers returned fire. One of our officers was struck with a shotgun blast.”

Three officers fired back, and Stogner went back inside and got a deer rifle.

Chief Morris says the suspect taunted the officers, and urged one who was hiding behind a tree to come out so Stogner would “have a better shot.”

There was an exchange of gunfire while officers tried to get to Moore, who was lying in the street. A third shift officer based with the South police precinct, Moore has been with the force since 2005. He is also a member of the SWAT team. He is married.

Officer Moore was shot in the upper torso, and his main wounds are from shrapnel to the face. Moore is in good condition at Huntsville Hospital after undergoing surgery for his injuries.

During the shots, Stogner’s wife ran to the house next door to take shelter.

Around 3:30 a.m. police entered Stogner’s home and there was more gunfire. Stogner was hit by multiple bullets and died.

“Ultimately we entered the home and the suspect is deceased,” said Chief Morris. “There was no evidence it was self-inflicted,” he added later.

Police said Stogner’s wife has facial injuries from their argument. This isn’t the couple’s first incident, Chief Morris said.

Witnesses reported hearing dozens of rapid-fire gunshots as the standoff unfolded. WHNT News 19’s Daniela Perallon talked with one neighbor, Brittany Nichols, who was told it wasn’t safe to leave her home.

Other residents along Stanford Drive were evacuated from their homes to First Baptist Church on Governors Drive. Chief Morris thanked Dr. David Hull and the church’s staff for opening their doors so quickly.

“We knew however long [the residents] would be there, we knew they were safe and would be well taken care of,” said Chief Morris.

Stanford Drive is still closed while investigators process the scene for evidence, and will likely remain so until Friday afternoon or evening. However, Chief Morris said people who live on the street should be allowed to return to their homes.

Update at 1:29 pm: WHNT News 19 spoke with Jennifer Stogner on the phone. She said William Stogner went by the name, “Art.” She said her family is trying to process a tremendous amount of information and are dealing with a tragic event. She said the family is grieving the loss of one of their relatives and they are praying for Officer Jason Moore and his family’s speedy recovery. At this time, the Stogner family has asked the media and the public to respect their privacy.
