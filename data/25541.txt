A 30-year-old motorcyclist died late Monday while being chased by police officers in northeast Alabama, state authorities said.

William Lee Gifford was operating a motorcycle that collided with a 2010 Chevrolet Tahoe, said state trooper spokesman Curtis Summerville.

“At the time of the incident, Gifford was being pursued by local law enforcement officers,” Summerville said in a news release. Summerville didn’t immediately return a call seeking further information. Troopers didn’t name the involved law enforcement agency in their press release.

Gifford was operating a 2010 Yamaha motorcycle, troopers said. Troopers didn’t say whether a police vehicle was involved in the crash. The driver of the SUV was taken to a hospital for treatment of injuries.

The crash happened around 8:45 p.m. on Alabama 35 in Jackson County. The scene was about three miles south of Section.

Further details weren’t immediately available.
