Police said Gregory Stegall, 36, took out a knife when police approached him behind a gas station near Catonsville around 3:40 a.m. Sunday. Stegall refused to come out from behind the building, they said. He was shot once after he did not follow instructions to drop his knife, could not be stopped with the Taser, and continued to come toward the officer while pointing the knife, according to police. Police said Stegall's last known address was in the Berea neighborhood of East Baltimore, police said.
