A lawsuit against the city of Minneapolis, filed by the mother of a radio host who died after two altercations with police, was tossed out of federal court on Thursday.

The suit stemmed from Quincy De'Shawn Smith's 2008 death after police used a Taser to subdue him during an arrest. His mother, Bettie Smith, claimed police had retaliated against her son for alleging police brutality in federal lawsuit related to a 2005 arrest.

She sued the city of Minneapolis, in addition to five officers. A federal judge dismissed the entire suit on Thursday.

The 24-year-old Smith died after police, responding to a domestic assult call in North Minneapolis, spotted him holding a gun. They tased Smith while struggling to arrest him, and he later went into cardiac arrest.
