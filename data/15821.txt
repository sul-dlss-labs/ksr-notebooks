ONTARIO, Calif. (KABC) -- A chase suspect in Ontario was shot dead by police after the man allegedly charged at officers with a samurai-style sword.

The suspect called police shortly after 10 p.m. Tuesday, telling them he had a gun and wanted to die.

Police tracked him down near Mission Boulevard and Mountain Avenue and attempted to pull his vehicle over. The suspect sped off, driving recklessly without his headlights.

After a short chase that lasted around five minutes, police said the suspect stopped the vehicle near Fern Avenue and Phillips Street.

Authorities said the suspect exited the car and came at them with a sword, ignoring officers' commands to stop and drop the weapon.

According to investigators, officers initially deployed rubber bullets, which did not stop the suspect. That's when the officer-involved shooting occurred.

The suspect was given medical treatment at the scene and transported to an area hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

No officers were injured in the incident. The suspect's name was not immediately released.
