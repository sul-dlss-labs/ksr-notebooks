MIDDLESEX COUNTY, Va. (WAVY) — A driver was killed in a crash Thursday night during a police chase in Middlesex County.

Virginia State Police say the crash happened around 9:15 p.m. on General Puller Highway.

A trooper tried to stop 27-year-old Aaron Michael Zalocha for going 75 mph in a 55 mph zone — but state police say the trooper temporarily lost sight of Zalocha’s Dodge Durango.

Moments later, the trooper found Zalocha’s car crashed near the intersection of Stampers Bay Road and General Puller.

State police say a preliminary investigation found Zalocha ran off the road into a ditch and hit a culvert, causing the car to overturn — ejecting him from the vehicle in the process.

State police say alcohol was not a factor in the crash.
