One person is dead from an apparent suicide after the Barren County Sheriff's Office received a call about a suspicious vehicle.

The sheriff's department responded to a complaint of a loud car making several passes throughout the Goodnight Terrance Road and North Jackson Highway area.

A deputy pulled the car over; as he approached the deputy heard a gunshot from inside the car and saw glass from the driver's side window blow out.

He found Michael McClanahan, 18, of Bowling Green, dead from an apparent self inflicted gunshot wound.

An autopsy is scheduled.
