A man was fatally shot after Isle of Wight County sheriff’s deputies said he attacked them Friday.

About 12:30 p.m., deputies arrived at a home in the 23000 block of Tara Court to serve arrest warrants. The front door was unlocked, Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Kristin Wilda said.

After they entered, James William Wallace, 31, attacked them with a knife, Wilda said. A deputy then shot Wallace.

He was pronounced dead at a hospital.

Wallace had 20 outstanding warrants. Twelve were on felony uttering. Eight were on misdemeanor obtaining money under false pretenses, a news release said.

State Police will conduct an investigation and send findings to the commonwealth’s attorney, Wilda said.

No deputies were hurt in the altercation, Wilda said. She said the status of the deputy who fired the shot had not yet been determined.
