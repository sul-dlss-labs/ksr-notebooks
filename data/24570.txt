CLAYTON, Mo. – A St. Louis man has been convicted of crashing a stolen car and killing his passenger while fleeing from police in suburban St. Louis.

The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that jurors found 27-year-old Reno Whitt Jr. guilty Wednesday of second-degree murder in the 2012 Hazelwood crash that killed 22-year-old Ricky Nelson. Court records said Whitt fled from officers after they were called to an apartment complex to investigate car break-ins.

Police say Whitt exceeded 90 mph before striking a utility pole. Two other passengers were hurt.

A jury in 2014 found Whitt guilty of three counts of vehicle tampering and resisting arrest but was deadlocked on the second-degree murder charge. He’s serving a 15-year prison term on the other counts, and will be sentenced for murder on Aug. 24.
