The family of Walter Wallace Jr. is blaming his fatal shooting at the hands of two city police officers in his West Philadelphia neighborhood Monday, in part, on a broader failure of the department to handle encounters with people experiencing mental health issues.

Video shot by a bystander Monday afternoon shows Wallace advancing toward two officers who responded to reports of a knife-wielding man near a family residence on the 6100 block of Locust Street. As Wallace moved forward, police fired 14 rounds at the 27-year-old man while neighbors looked on and his mother tried to tell police to stop shooting at her son.

Chief Police Inspector Frank Vanore said officers were dispatched in response to calls that Wallace was screaming and that he was armed with a knife, while sources told the Inquirer that police had been called to the house three times that day.

But on Tuesday, lawyers for the Wallace family painted another, more complex picture, saying Wallace’s brother had called 911 hoping to summon an ambulance crew and de-escalate a crisis involving their son, who was suffering from severe mental illness.

Attorney Shaka Johnson, who is representing the Wallace family, said the police officers who ultimately arrived instead escalated a tense situation.

“[Wallace] was on a regimen of lithium, and that says to me he was under doctor’s care … His wife told [police] that he was manic and bipolar,” Johnson said. “Officers who are trained properly should notice certain things when they arrive at a scene. Especially when his wife tells them, ‘Stand down, officers.’”

According to Johnson, police had been on the block on two previous occasions before the fatal encounter. Wallace’s family said they did not call for help the first two times police showed up, but when they did, the family made sure to tell officers Wallace was having a mental health crisis.
