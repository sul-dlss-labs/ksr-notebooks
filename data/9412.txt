FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) Â— A Flagstaff police officer who fatally shot a man during a domestic disturbance call two months ago has been cleared of any wrongdoing.

Mohave County chief deputy attorney James Zach says he has determined that officer Roy Taylor's conduct was justified and no criminal charges are warranted in the Aug. 25 shooting.

Police say 78-year-old Kenneth Mitchell was shot and killed in his son's apartment after officers were called to the scene.

After looking through a window into the home, officers believed that Mitchell was ready to shoot his 33-year-old son and Taylor opened fire.

The Arizona Daily Sun says Zach's ruling was contained in a letter dated Oct. 8 sent to the Flagstaff Police Department.
