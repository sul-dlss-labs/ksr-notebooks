CALDWELL -- A grand jury earlier this month determined a Caldwell police officer was justified in shooting and killing a man who had just stabbed his girlfriend in her condominium, according to the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office.

The incident happened in June last year on Espy Road. Authorities said Darryl Elder, 37, stabbed his girlfriend, Tawanna Grant, repeatedly. When police arrived, Elder barricaded himself inside the unit. Officers waited for backup and then forced their way in. But when Elder lunged at them with a knife, Caldwell police Lt. Marc Driggs shot him twice in the chest, killing him instantly. Grant, 33, died less than two hours later after she was rushed to Morristown Memorial Hospital.

Following protocol, the prosecutor’s office sent the case to the grand jury, although there was no indication the shooting was unjustified.

“Lt. Driggs’ actions on the day in question likely saved lives and more than likely the life of at least one police officer,” Driggs’ attorney, Patrick P. Toscano Jr., said in a statement. “Accordingly, he should be recognized as nothing other than the hero he is.”
