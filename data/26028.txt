The Coroner’s Office Saturday released the name of a 49-year-old man who was fatally shot during an officer-involved shooting in Montebello.

The shooting victim was identified as Eddie Herrera, according to the coroner’s office, adding that Herrera was homeless.

Officers were dispatched at 1:30 p.m. Thursday to investigate a report of people who were possibly drunk and smoking marijuana, according to the Montebello Police Department.

“The first Montebello officer to arrive on scene saw an individual walking with an apparent rifle on or near Second Street and Victoria Avenue,” according to a police statement. “The officer requested additional Montebello officers to the area, at which time an officer-involved shooting occurred.”

Herrera “who was in possession of what was ultimately determined to be a shotgun, was treated for at least one gunshot wound at the scene and transported to an area hospital, where he was later pronounced deceased,” police said.

The sheriff’s department, which is assisting Montebello police in the shooting investigation, later reported that it “appears at this time, that the suspect discharged the shotgun at least one time and the officers returned fire, striking the suspect at least one time in the upper torso,” according to Deputy Edmo Luna of the Sheriff’s Information Bureau.

No officers were injured.

The shotgun was recovered at the scene.
