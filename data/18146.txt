A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a man in the unincorporated Florence area after the man pulled a gun early Thursday evening, authorities said.

The shooting occurred about 5:45 p.m. in the 1700 block of 83rd Street, sheriff’s officials said.

Century Station deputies responded to a gunshot victim call at that location and while deputies attended to the victim, other deputies attempted to detain three male suspects, according to investigators.

One of the suspects ran down an alley, immediately followed by two deputies. When the deputies caught up to the suspect at the end of the alley, the man turned toward one of them and drew a revolver from his waistband, investigators said.

That’s when the deputy-involved shooting took place. The suspect was struck by gunfire in the upper torso and taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The deputies were not injured. The original gunshot victim is listed in serious but fair condition.

The suspect’s loaded revolver was recovered at the scene, investigators said. The investigation is ongoing.
