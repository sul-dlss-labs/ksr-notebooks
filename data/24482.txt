SAN DIEGO — Two people were killed in a head-on crash as the driver of a stolen car sped away from deputies and veered into oncoming traffic near Pauma Valley Sunday. A third person inside the stolen Honda Accord was injured, as well as the driver of a car that they hit. The chase began just before 1 a.m. when sheriff’s deputies spotted a Honda Accord that had been reported stolen in Escondido, according to San Diego County Sheriff’s Sgt. Michael Tingley. A sheriff’s department helicopter also joined in on the chase. Deputies eventually decided to call the chase off due to concerns about high speeds and wet roads, Tingley said. Shortly after deputies pulled back, the driver of the stolen vehicle veered into oncoming traffic on Valley Center Road at Rocky Top Lane, just south of Route 76, north of Valley Center. It crashed head-on into a small compact vehicle. The driver and one passenger in the fleeing vehicle were both killed, Tingley said. One more person in the Accord was injured, as well as one person in the car that the suspects crashed into. Both were hospitalized. Beer bottles were found in the vehicle that had been fleeing from deputies, said Dave Schaller with the Sheriff’s Department The Sheriff’s Department did not immediately release names of the fleeting suspects.
