WHITBY, W.Va. — One person is dead and a Raleigh County Sheriff’s deputy is in the hospital but expected to recover following an officer-involved shooting early Thursday morning.

According to authorities, the deputy was shot twice in the chest during an altercation around 9:00 a.m. in the Fireco/Whitby area following a vehicle chase. The deputy was shot and then shot back and killed the suspect, according to the West Virginia Sheriff’s Association.

“The individual was fighting with the deputy and then pulled out a firearm, fired upon the deputy, hitting him twice in the chest and the deputy returned fire at that point,” Rodney Miller, Executive Director of WV Sheriff’s Association told MetroNews.

Miller said the two individuals were the only ones on the scene during the incident.

The association, Raleigh County Sheriff’s Department and Gov. Jim Justice all confirmed the deputy’s life was saved because of the vest he was wearing.

“Fortunately the deputy was wearing his vest. They do work, they do save lives and this is another example of that,” Miller said.
