A father of five went on the rampage critically wounding two deputies at a sheriff's office in north-central Kansas before then holding his own family hostage and driving off in their minivan.

Kansas Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Melissa Underwood says the suspect, Jason Lee Whitson, entered the Jewell County Sheriff's Office in Mankato around 8am Tuesday.

There was a 'disturbance' and the man shot one deputy in the neck and another in the torso before fleeing.

The Kansas Highway Patrol says a trooper spotted the suspect's minivan about 45 minutes later, 35 miles southeast of Mankato, near Glasco.

Officials say Whitson ignored a trooper's commands to pull over and continued on at a normal speed.

He drove another 20 miles before letting out members of his family, including his wife and five kids, before taking off again.

This time, a trooper performed a 'tactical vehicle intervention' at 9:11am. The suspect lost control of the vehicle as he was driven off the road according to WIBW.

Troopers found him inside the vehicle with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The Jewell Co. Sheriff's Office says one deputy is being treated for their injuries and is expected to be released later Tuesday. The other was taken by air ambulance to a Salina Hospital and will undergo surgery.

The suspect, Whitson, later died after attempting to take his own life with a gun.

Governor Jeff Colyer Tweeted after learning about the shooting, saying, 'I'm praying for a full recovery for the two Jewell County deputies shot in the line of duty earlier this morning. We appreciate the service rendered by all law enforcement officers, and thank them for their bravery.'
