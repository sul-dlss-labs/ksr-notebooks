SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A police officer responding to a domestic violence call Saturday shot a suspect after he armed himself with a butcher knife, police said.

Officers responded to the call in downtown Salt Lake City at 2:33 a.m., and determined the fight was between Kevin Leslie Jones, 53, his girlfriend and another man.

Jones allegedly left the scene, but returned with a large knife and approached one of the officers.

Police say the officer shot Jones after he refused to put down the knife.

Jones was pronounced dead at a hospital.
