LOS ANGELES – A naked man fatally run over by a Los Angeles police car in Jefferson Park was identified today.

Paul Burkons, 57, of Los Angeles was lying in the road at or near Adams Boulevard and Buckingham Road when an officer responding to a report of a naked man ran him over about 10:20 p.m. Sunday, according to police and coroner’s spokesman.

According to broadcast reports, the man was homeless.

Lt. Andy Neiman said detectives would try to determine if the man was mentally ill or under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

Officers drove up Buckingham Road but the call was for a naked man on Hillcrest Drive and Adams Boulevard about two blocks west, so they would not have expected to encounter a man lying in the street, police spokeswoman Liliana Preciado said.
