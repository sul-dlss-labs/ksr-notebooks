A man died Thursday while reportedly fleeing from a Larimer County sheriff's deputy at speeds topping 100 mph on a county road near Berthoud.

The chase that ended in the fatal crash began after a deputy attempted to pull over the driver of a BMW sedan in the area of West County Road 8 and Meadowlark Drive in Berthoud. The deputy was in the area after receiving reports of possible drug activity, according to a Larimer County Sheriff's Office news release.

When the deputy attempted to make the traffic stop, the unidentified driver of the BMW sped down County Road 17 at speeds upward of 100 mph, according to the news release.

The driver of the BMW pulled away from the deputy, who ultimately found the driver dead near the intersection of County Roads 17 and 2E, about 3 miles from where the chase began. It appeared the driver of the BMW, an adult man, crashed off the roadway. No other cars were involved in the crash.

The man who died was the only person in the car. The Larimer County Coroner's Office will release his name once his next of kin has been notified.

The Larimer County Sheriff's Office is reviewing the chase to determine whether the deputy followed the office's pursuit policies, which is standard procedure after car chases.

After the crash, investigators learned that the man killed had multiple outstanding warrants for his arrest and a suspended driver's license.
