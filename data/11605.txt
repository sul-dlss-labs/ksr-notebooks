"There was a video tape - there were two cameras, one of which very well may have captured the shooting," Sebring said.

Before the State Attorney's Office weighed in, the TPD had offered a blurry photo to the media hat they said revealed that Javon Neal was carrying a gun moments before he was told to stand down by the Tampa Police officers.

"That's convenient for them," Sebring said of that photo. "But unfortunately, when they're holding all the cards and they won't let us see their hand, we don't know what they have. That's the real problem."

Sebring says he has a forensic pathologist that wants to look at the medical examiner's autopsy report as well as the videotape that he believes was released to the police department.

Recently detectives with the department met with Sebring at his Ybor offices and said he was told that there was still an ongoing investigation into this homicide, which startled the attorney, who said that with the officers already cleared, what's to investigate?

The two officers involved in the Javon Neal shooting, Shannon Murphy and Gregory Pryor, had been suspended while the investigation of their actions was ongoing. But they are now back out on duty.

Sebring says one of the Tampa police department detectives told him 'this is a homicide and if you don't want to cooperate with us, will find other ways to make you cooperate.'

"It's the lack of transparency that has got everybody upset," the attorney said.

CL contacted the Tampa Police Department on Monday for comment on Sebring's remarks, but as of Tuesday morning they had yet to do so.
