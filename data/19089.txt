Garvin County Sheriff Larry Rhodes says investigators are trying to determine why a 58-year-old man shot and killed his girlfriend's son before barricading himself inside a home and killing himself.

Just after 11 a.m. Monday, April 8, the Garvin County 911 Center received a call from a home at 101 West Street in Paoli. The caller said someone had been shot.

When Paoli police officers arrived, they found shooting victim Noel Sanchez, 22. They say Sanchez's brother was the one who called 911. Sanchez was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Police officers say Antonio Elias Reynoso barricaded himself inside a bedroom and refused to come out. Believing the suspect was still armed with the handgun used in the shooting, the Paoli Police Department called in help from the Garvin County Sheriff's Office and surrounding police departments, and a standoff began.

At approximately 4 p.m., the Oklahoma Highway Patrol tactical team entered the house and found Reynoso dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Deputies later discovered Reynoso had an extensive criminal record in California and went by several aliases.

Deputies say they aren't sure why Reynoso shot Sanchez, but they believe there may have been a history of unreported domestic violence between Reynoso and Sanchez's mother that may have led to a deadly confrontation.
