No weapon was found on a man who was shot and killed this week by a Santa Ana police officer, although a search for one continues, authorities said Friday.

Arthur Anthony Magana, 21, of Santa Ana was shot once in the chest Thursday by a veteran motorcycle officer. Authorities said the officer stopped Magana on North Minter Street for a traffic violation. The car Magana was driving was reported stolen, police said.

The officer pursued Magana on his motorcycle and eventually on foot into the Villa La Palma apartments. Police said Magana ducked into an apartment as the residents were walking out. The officer confronted Magana inside, where he shot him, police said.

The officer believed his life was in danger, Police Sgt. Baltazar De La Riva said Friday. He would not elaborate. “There are details that I’m not at liberty to get into,” he said.

The unidentified officer was placed on administrative leave.

A spokeswoman for the Orange County district attorney’s office, which is investigating the shooting, would not comment.

In May, Santa Ana police shot and wounded an unarmed man as he approached them holding a black flashlight that they mistook for a weapon. Prosecutors decided not to file criminal charges against the officers.
