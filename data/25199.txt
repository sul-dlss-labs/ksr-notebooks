Authorities said Peterson fired multiple rounds at deputies who responded to his home in the 7300 block of Humboldt Avenue just before 12:30 a.m. Saturday after a domestic dispute call.

Deputy Christopher Stone, 41, was struck in the femoral artery in his leg during the exchange of gunfire. Stone continues to recover from his injuries in the hospital. Peterson suffered a head injury in the exchange. Officials have not said if the injury was a result of their gunfire or a self-inflicted wound.
