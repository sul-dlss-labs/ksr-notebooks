Two Des Moines police officers involved in a July fatal shooting will not face criminal charges.

A grand jury determined officers Theodore Stroope and Jacob Hedlund were justified in shooting an armed home invasion suspect.

When Stroope and Hedlund responded to the scene on July 5th, one of the suspects pointed his weapon at the officers. They responded by firing seven shots. Three bullets hit 57-year-old Larry Hawkins. He died from a gunshot wound the chest.

An internal investigation cleared the officers of wrongdoing and they returned to normal duty at the end of August.

The second suspect, 52-year-old Michael Walker, faces charges of burglary, intimidation with a dangerous weapon, assault and possession of a weapon as a felon.
