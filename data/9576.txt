A man who was shot and killed by Gary police after lunging at them with a knife Wednesday night has been identified, officials said.

Michael Nunn, 40, of the 4300 block of Virginia Street, was shot and killed near his home at 8:36 p.m., a spokesman for the Lake County coroner's office said Thursday morning. The cause of death was listed as multiple gunshot wounds suffered in an apparent homicide.

Lt. Sam Roberts, spokesman for the Gary Police Department, said Wednesday night Nunn was "deranged."

Two officers responded to the 4300 block of Virginia Street about 8 p.m. after neighbors reported a man was threatening people with a knife, Roberts said.

Roberts said other officers were familiar with Nunn, who had been reported to police Tuesday for similar behavior.

The officers ordered Nunn to drop his knife, and he charged at them, Roberts said.

At least one officer shot Nunn.

"The officers have been placed on administrative leave, which is part of the department's policy," Roberts said. They will remain on leave for at least three days.

Lake County police are investigating the shooting, Roberts said.

Roberts couldn't say whether a knife was recovered at the scene.
