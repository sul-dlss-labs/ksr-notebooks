The man shot and killed in a police-involved shooting in Hartford early Wednesday morning has been identified as Ernesto Morales.

State police are investigating the shooting and said the four officers involved on Wednesday morning were members of the Southwest Conditions Team who noticed suspicious activity at a housing complex at 60 Wadsworth Street around 1 a.m.

According to a news release from Hartford police, they "located three subjects secreted inside a car backed into a parking space," approached them and ordered them to display their hands.

Morales, the driver, started the car, pulled forward and rammed the parked Hartford cruiser, then backed up and drove directly at the Hartford officers, who were on foot, police said.

The officers tried to get away, ordered Morales to stop and one officer drew his service weapon and fired at the vehicle, police said.

The car continued across the grass and hit an apartment building.

Morales was pronounced dead at the scene.

A passenger, Martin Casseras, 35, was treated at the scene and went through surgery at Hartford Hospital.

A second person inside the vehicle was injured by gunfire, police said.

The three officers involved have been identified as Officers William Cody, Kenneth Medina, Kenneth Labbe and Robert Iovanna.

As is department policy, the officers have been temporarily assigned to administrative duty.

The chief state's medical examiner will perform an autopsy on Morales.
