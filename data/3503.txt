A Dallas police officer who was charged with sexual assault last month was found dead Friday morning of an apparent suicide at his home in Little Elm.

The body of David Wayne Kattner, 47, was discovered by his wife shortly after 9 a.m. in the house in the 200 block of Brookdale Drive. Little Elm police released a statement saying the preliminary cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The Tarrant County medical examiner will perform an autopsy and make a final ruling.

In a brief written statement announcing the death, A Dallas police spokesman said the department “wishes to express its condolences to the family.”

Officers arrested Kattner on a charge of sexual assault, a second-degree felony, after a prostitute told police he forced her to perform a sex act on him while he was on duty. She told police that he had forced her to do so twice before. Kattner also allegedly showed the woman her outstanding warrants and told her that he knew where her daughter lived.

Other recent officers who had been accused of sexual assault either resigned or were fired before their criminal cases were resolved.

Kattner, a 26-year veteran of the department, was a northeast patrol officer.

During his career, Kattner came under scrutiny several times. In 2004, he shot Kevin Andrew Sinning, 26, who pointed a gun at him after holding it to his own head. Sinning ended up turning his gun back and shooting himself in the head after Kattner shot him. Kattner was cleared by a grand jury in that shooting.

Kattner was a field training officer to Shanna Lopez the next year. Lopez has accused Kattner of being obsessed with writing tickets to prostitutes. She accused Kattner of being involved in a ticket-writing scheme that caused two officers to be fired and another to be suspended. Lopez said she was forced out of the department.

Kattner was never linked to the scandal by police investigations. After Lopez went public with her allegations in D Magazine in 2007, Kattner sued the publication. He eventually lost the case after years of appeals.

Still, Lopez said Friday that she felt conflicted about Kattner, with whom she spent seven weeks at the start of her truncated career with the department.

“I should hate him. I should have a lot of anger and resentment toward him,” she said. “But that’s so hard to do. … I have so many fond memories of him as a person.”

She said she never heard of Kattner sexually assaulting any prostitutes while she was at the department. But she said she wasn’t surprised, saying it would be a natural progression from his involvement with the disgraced ticket-writing officers.

“Unfortunately, that was a turning point for him.”
