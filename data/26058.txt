The Snellville Police Department says a man died after taking officers on a high-speed chase. According to the police report, the man crashed into a tree.

Investigators identified the driver as 27-year-old Damion Burnell.

The report says an officer stopped Burnell on Tuesday, April 16 around 2:15 a.m. The officer's body camera video shows him asking Burnell for his driver's license and asking for him to hand over a small package in his right hand. Moments after telling the officer he didn't have his license with him, Burnell took off from the stop. He went along Wisteria Drive and turned onto North Road.

Georgia State Patrol is handling the accident portion of the case. It says, at one point, Burnell was going more than 100 miles an hour.

The police report says the officer lost sight of Burnell when the vehicle he was driving went off of North Road. It clipped a mailbox, went through several yards and hit a tree.

Officers on scene say Burnell was wearing a fanny pack. They say his license was inside of it.

Snellville Police tell FOX 5 News the officer involved remains on full patrol.
