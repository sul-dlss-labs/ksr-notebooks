IOWA FALLS | A man who was killed in a standoff with law enforcement in Iowa Falls Thursday was a native of Latimer.

Authorities said Leighton C. Fitz, 25, was shot and killed by law enforcement officers. They released his name Friday.

The Iowa Falls Police Department responded to an emergency call of an armed suicidal man at 413 College Avenue at 1:20 p.m. on Thursday, according to a press release from the Iowa Department of Public Safety.

Upon arrival, the armed man, Fitz, exited the residence armed with several weapons and wearing a bullet-proof vest, according to authorities.

He allegedly refused to obey commands from officers on the scene, and reached for a weapon. After refusing to drop the weapon, officers fired rounds, fatally striking Fitz, according to police.

After a search of the residence, Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agents found multiple loaded weapons and a gas mask. Agents also discovered threats towards officers on Fitz’s Facebook page.

Fitz's Facebook page lists his hometown as Latimer, and indicates he attended CAL-Dows High School.
