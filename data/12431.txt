Age: 70 Gender: Male Race/ethnicity: White Cause: Shooting Jonathan Whitted was identified as the police officer who killed John Stanley Schaefer.

John Stanley Schaefer, 70, was fatally shot around 7:45 a.m. on March 1, 2013, at his home at 10617 Lanshire Drive. Police say Schaefer had called police that morning to report that he had shot and killed a pitbull that attacked him. After Austin police officer Jonathan Whitted arrived at the house, he shot Schaefer twice in the chest because he said Schaefer pointed a gun at him. As is customary in such shootings, the case was presented to a Travis County grand jury, which on June 23, 2014, no-billed Whitted, clearing him of any criminal charges.
