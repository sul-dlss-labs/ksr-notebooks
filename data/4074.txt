On May 23, eight Santa Barbara police officers were awarded the

H. Thomas Guerry Award for Valor in recognition of their

exceptional bravery and skill in the field. Sr. Deputy Clayton

Turner, Deputy Michael Harris, Deputy Jonathon Jenkins, Deputy

Kenneth Rushing, and Deputy Christopher Gotschall — who comprise

Goleta Patrol Squad D — were recognized for their response to late

January’s tragic postal service shootings. Squad D was the first to

arrive on the scene, where officers located three victims in the

parking lot. With the shooter still at large, the squad charged

inside the building and located a victim who had been shot in the

head, yet was miraculously still alive. Police protected the victim

until backup arrived, and the SWAT Team confirmed that the shooter

had fatally turned the gun on herself.

Officers James Ella, Darin Biamonte, and Larry Larson were

recognized for their heroic response to the tragic violence of

April 24, 2005, when the officers received a complaint about a

disturbance on Haley Street. There they found a 28-year-old

resident in a wild rage induced by crystal meth, threatening his

father with a knife and torch. The knifeman ignored pleas and

pepper spray, instead lashing out and screaming threats at the

officers. In the end, Officer Ella was forced to shoot and mortally

wounded the suspect when he rushed at police with the knife.
