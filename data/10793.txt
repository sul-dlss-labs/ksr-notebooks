Lee Jefferson, a 23-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, Nov. 23, in the 800 block of East 105th Street in Green Meadows, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The incident began about 9:40 a.m. when LAPD officers went to serve an arrest warrant on Jefferson, Officer Karen Rayner of the Los Angeles Police Department said. Jefferson led them on a foot pursuit from a location at 104th Street and Avalon Boulevard.

LAPD officers set up a perimeter while bringing in Metro and SWAT officers in an attempt to contain him. They were deploying when he was located and tried to flee a second time before being cornered.

"During the search, Metro officers encountered him and were preparing to take him into custody when the officer-involved shooting occurred," Rayner said.

During the exchange of gunfire, an officer was shot but is expected to recover, officials said.

Jefferson, who was wanted in connection with a homicide in the LAPD's Olympic Division, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Anyone with details about the shooting can leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800) 222-8477.
