The Minnesota State Patrol identified the two occupants of a car that a state trooper collided with in Cannon Falls, Minn. as Norman L. Scott, 78, and his wife, Geneva M. Scott, 79, both from Cannon Falls.

The State Patrol said Reps’ squad car hit the Scotts’ 2012 Ford Taurus Friday afternoon as it pulled out of a parking lot onto 65th Street at Goodhue County Road 24, on the south end of Cannon Falls.

The trooper, Scott R. Reps, was responding to a traffic accident involving a collision between a motorcycle and a deer on Minnesota 60 when he T-boned the Scotts’ vehicle.

The Ford Crown Victoria squad car had its lights and sirens activated when it hit the Scotts’ vehicle, State Patrol Lt. Eric Roeske said at a Friday evening news conference at the Cannon Falls Police Department.

Reps was airlifted to a Mayo Clinic hospital in Rochester with injuries that were serious but not life threatening, the State Patrol said. Reps is a 28-year veteran of the State Patrol.

Norman Scott, who was driving the Taurus, was pulling out of a business parking lot and was T-boned by the squad.

A second vehicle, a 2009 Jeep Commander, apparently rear-ended the Taurus as it followed it out of the parking lot, but no one in it was injured.

Cannon Falls Police Chief Jeff McCormick said the area where the collision occurred isn’t a problem spot for accidents. The road, along a commercial zone just east of U.S. 52, has 45-mph speed limit. Authorities declined to estimate the squad car’s speed at the time of the crash.

Cannon Falls is about 35 miles southeast of St. Paul.
