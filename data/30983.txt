A man and woman died Saturday night in a single vehicle crash in Morgan County, minutes after sheriff’s deputies had called off a high speed chase of the vehicle in which they were riding, according to a statement Sunday on the sheriff office’s Facebook page.

Harley Wayne Hill, 24 of Decatur was pronounced deceased at the scene and Abagale Victorine Holladay, 25, of Athens was transported to a hospital where she died of her injuries, according to the statement.

According to the sheriff’s statement, at about 10:30 p.m. Saturday deputies “encountered a vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed” on U.S. Highway 31 in Flint. “A traffic stop was initiated with the vehicle accelerating to over 100 MPH and failing to yield. At 10:31 the pursuit was canceled due to weather/road conditions,” according to the statement.

About three minutes later the vehicle was located at a single-vehicle rollover wreck on Highway 31 at Lane Rd in Hartselle, shutting down the Southbound lanes of Highway 31, according to the statement.

Multiple agencies responded to the scene, including the Hartselle Police Department, Hartselle Fire and Rescue, Lifeguard EMS, according to the statement. The Hartselle Police Department is handling the traffic investigation, according to the statement.
