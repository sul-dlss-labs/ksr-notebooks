A woman who was shot by a police officer during a Friday morning standoff was later found dead inside an Aguanga home in the 44000 block of Jacob Court.

The woman reportedly pointed a handgun at deputies and refused orders to drop her weapon before she was shot by a police officer.

Following the shooting, the woman retreated into the home and refused to exit, prompting a SWAT team response.

UPDATE: Woman shot by deputy in Aguanga identified

The identity of the woman was not released late Friday night. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.

Officers drove to Aguanga while investigating a domestic disturbance call earlier in the morning in the 54000 block of Wildwood Drive in Idyllwild.

The 911 caller said a woman with a gun was threatening people at the residence, a release states.

By the time deputies arrived, the woman had fled the area.

They got to Aguanga around 10 a.m. and found the female suspect, who was still in possession of a handgun.

After the shooting, the SWAT team attempted to get the woman to leave the residence but she did not respond. After several attempts, officers entered the building and found her body.
