MONETT, Mo. – An investigation by the Missouri Highway Patrol cleared a Monett police officer involved in a deadly shooting last fall.

Investigators say Monett police officer Austin Royster has been cleared in the fatal shooting of 50-year-old Michael Culhane, of Monett. Officers were dispatched to a home in the 400 block of N. Central Avenue around 5 p.m. on the evening of Friday, Sept. 8.

Investigators say it began as a medical call, but as personnel responded, a man at the home said, “have the guns ready,” according to the news release.

Royster was the first person on the scene and later fired three shots at Culhane.

Investigators say Culhane was seated when Royster arrived, with a knife hidden under his leg. They say he later rose from the chair, cut his own throat, and lunged at Royster. Culhane also threw the knife at Royster, leaving Royster with a minor cut to his arm.

According to the news release, medical assistance for Culhane arrived within two minutes to provide aid. Culhane was transported from the scene but was later pronounced dead before arriving at the hospital.

According to the news release, a witness statement at the scene didn’t match up with the highway patrol’s investigation.

Royster won’t face criminal charges.
