A suspected robber who died in an exchange of gunfire with Killeen police officers was a juvenile and has now been identified.

DPS Sergeant David Roberts confirmed the deceased suspect's identify Saturday.

"After further discussion with the District Attorney’s Office and Killeen Police Department, and although the investigation is ongoing, the suspect’s name is Daezion Turner," said Roberts.

Turner was 15.

Texas Rangers are investigating the deadly shooting, which happened late Monday afternoon.

The officers confronted Turner after responding to a report of a robbery at around 4:15 p.m. Monday at the T-Mobile store at the Killeen Marketplace shopping center in the 3200 block of East Central Texas Expressway.

“Upon the officers’ arrival, they were confronted by the suspect as he was exiting the store,” police spokeswoman Ofelia Miramontez said.

“The suspect immediately fled on foot with the officers in pursuit. During the foot pursuit the suspect turned and fired at the three officers, who returned fire,” she said.

The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene just after 6 p.m.

An officer was taken to a local hospital with injuries not related to the shooting, police said.

The officer, who was not identified, was treated and later released.
