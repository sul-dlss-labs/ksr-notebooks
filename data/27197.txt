Lamar County Coroner Cody Creel identified the man as 46-year-old Kenneth Collins of Lumberton.

Collins was shot around 2 p.m. Sunday in the 6000 block of U.S. 98, near Turtle Creek Mall, after police responded to a call for service.

He said Collins was transported from the scene to a local hospital, where he later died.

There were no other injuries reported during the incident, Moore said.
