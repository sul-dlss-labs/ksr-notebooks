ARITON, Ala. (WDHN) — The man killed in an officer involved shooting early this morning in Dale County has been identified.

Dale County Coroner Woody Hilboldt identified the man as Gene Beasley. He was killed after leading a Dale County Sheriff’s deputy on a high-speed chase just after midnight.

According to a written statement from Chief Deputy Mason Bynum with the Dale County Sheriff’s Office, the incident started with a traffic stop on East Main Street in Ariton.

Bynum said when the officer tried to take the suspect into custody for an outstanding felony warrant, he fled the scene in his vehicle.

During the chase, Bynum said the suspect lost control of his vehicle at the intersection of Alabama Highway 123 and U.S. Highway 231.

“As the deputy approached, the suspect produced a handgun, and the deputy engaged the suspect with deadly force,” Bynum said in a written statement. “The suspect was pronounced deceased at the scene.”

The Alabama State Bureau of Investigation has taken over the investigation, which is standard procedure for an officer involved shooting.

The officer, who has not been identified, has been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.
