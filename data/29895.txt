An armed robbery suspect accused of stealing a Rockland police cruiser and leading police on a chase has died after being shot by a state trooper in Quincy, the Norfolk County District Attorney has confirmed.The string of dangerous events that culminated in the deadly shooting began in Rockland with the robbery of a 7-Eleven location on Market Street. Rockland Police Chief John Llewellyn said surveillance video showed the man looking through the store's windows around 6:10 a.m. and he entered the store about six minutes later. 5 Investigates has learned the man was Eric Leach, 36, who was originally from Brockton but also had ties in Winthrop. Documents show his criminal history includes multiple charges for assault and break-ins, an arrest for theft of a motor vehicle and three years in prison for a shooting in which a child was wounded. The chief said the man took a handgun from his waistband, told the employees of the store they were being robbed and got away with approximately $330. Subsequently, a customer entered to cash a winning scratch-off lottery ticket and the employees told him what happened. Llewellyn said that customer went outside and followed the suspect up Highland Street and was able to give a good description of the man to police. Several officers began searching the area and one cornered the man against a fence in a residential area. "He refused to comply with commands and, in fact, put his arms up and challenged the officer to shoot him and walked at the officer," Llewellyn said.The chief said the veteran officer holstered his gun and switched to a Taser, but it was ineffective because the man was wearing a thick sweater. A foot pursuit followed through the neighborhood, with multiple officers involved. During that time, resident Christine Breadmore said the man approached her home. "I actually opened my window and I said, 'Can I help you with something?' You could tell he was all shaky and nervous and he said, 'Oh, I just got jumped by two kids, can I come in and use your phone?'" Breadmore said she refused.On Brookside Road the suspect found and entered one of the officer's cruisers. Police approached and drew their firearms, but Llewellyn said the man started the cruiser, backed up and then drove at the officers, who stepped out of the way. “The suspect was able to enter a Rockland police cruiser and he fled the scene toward Weymouth and Abington,” District Attorney Michael Morrissey said. “During that chase, the suspect struck a number of police cruisers of local departments."During the chase, an Abington police officer lost control of his vehicle in Rockland and struck a utility pole. The cruiser rolled over, injuring the officer.State police troopers joined the pursuit as it progressed northbound along Route 3, Morrissey said. The pursuit was paused at Burgin Parkway and Route 3 in Quincy, where the stolen cruiser stopped on a ramp and was surrounded by several police vehicles. Morrissey said troopers in an armored vehicle, who happened to be in the area already, approached and tried to engage with the suspect. However, after an hour, the driver was able to get the damaged cruiser moving again and he drove away."Police had deployed Stop Sticks on Burgin Parkway and helped bring the car to a slow stop," Morrissey said. Police officers ran to their vehicles and chased the stolen cruiser before it was stopped on Liberty Street near the BJ's Gas Station. Two SWAT vehicles sandwiched the stolen cruiser and prevented the suspect from fleeing, as negotiations continued. "During the verbal negotiations, the police observed the suspect in control of a police patrol rifle. Despite the numerous requests to surrender, the suspect started to come out of the passenger door armed with a patrol rifle," Morrissey said.Witness Jaycie Zinsner and her mother were driving to an appointment when they came upon the scene.“I looked over, and I saw the car that was obviously the police car and a lot of crisis negotiators,” Zinsner said. “A police officer came and told me and my mom, ‘Get out of the vehicle. He has a gun. You are within danger.'”Zinsner said they stood behind police vehicles as the situation unfolded."My heart was pounding. It still is. I am very scared right now. I am shaking," she said. "It's still very scary right now because they were saying he has a gun."A Massachusetts State Police Special Tactical Operations (STOP) Team member discharged his weapon and shot the man.A NewsCenter 5 crew was at the scene when a popping sound was heard, and officers removed the person from the cruiser. State police later said the situation "resulted in an officer-involved shooting of an adult male suspect."“It is unfortunate that anybody got shot by anyone. The last thing that I think that a police officer wants to do is get involved in a police-related shooting. Their job is to keep all of us safe, and those people, and I think they tried to clear people out of the area. They were faced with an armed suspect. They have decisions to make, and those decisions will be reviewed over the next few days,” Morrissey said.Leach was taken to Boston Medical Center, where he later died, 5 Investigates has learned. Red Line service was suspended between Braintree and Wollaston, and significant delays were reported on the commuter rail on the Greenbush, Middleborough and Kingston lines.
