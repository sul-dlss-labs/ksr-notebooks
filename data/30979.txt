The Polk County Sheriff’s Office has identified the man who barricaded himself in a Balsam Lake motel for 11 hours last week.

Deputies say 39-year-old Eric Keesen killed himself before the Thursday standoff ended.

There were active arrest warrants in Keesen’s name for felony crimes in Barron and Washburn counties.

He was found hiding in an attic space.

Negotiations aimed at convincing him to surrender were unsuccessful and he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
