HOPE MILLS, N.C. (WNCN) — A man armed with a machete was shot and killed by a Cumberland County deputy Tuesday afternoon, officials say.

The incident was first reported just before 4:45 p.m. on Summerfield Lane when deputies were trying to serve an involuntary commitment order on a man, according to a news release from the Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office.

Adrian Jason Roberts, 37, was the subject of the order, officials said.

“When deputies made contact with Roberts he charged at them with a machete. One of the deputies discharged his weapon striking Roberts,” the news release said.

Deputies at the scene tried to save Roberts’ life until EMS arrived, according to the news release.

However, Roberts died at the scene, which is south of Fayetteville and just east of Hope Mills.

“Loss of life is a tragedy under any circumstances,” the news release said.

Family members at the scene say the incident never should have happened. They say Roberts was a veteran who suffered from PTSD and that no one should be killed because they suffer from mental illness.

Cumberland County Sheriff Ennis Wright has requested the SBI investigate the shooting. The incident will be investigated internally as well, the news release said.
