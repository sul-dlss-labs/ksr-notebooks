Suspect Dead After Pursuit Ends With Crash

An predawn chase by the Escambia County Sheriff’s Department ended with the death of a suspect early Friday morning.

The sheriff’s department says John Jeffery Reed, Jr., 22, of Pensacola was killed when the stolen vehicle he was driving hit a tree during a pursuit.

At about 4:42 this morning, Escambia deputies observed a vehicle southbound on Mobile Highway matching the description of a vehicle that was reported stolen on the same shift.

Reed turned into a gas station at Mobile Highway and New Warrington Road. The vehicle tag on the 2006 Chevrolet Colorado pickup was confirmed as stolen and a traffic stop was initiated, according Sgt. Ted Roy, spokesperson for the ECSO. The stolen vehicle immediately pulled out of the parking lot and down Webb Lane.

Reed than did a u-turn running over the stop sign at Webb Lane and Dogwood Drive and headed straight at the pursuing deputy causing that deputy to take evasive action by driving completely off the road, Roy said.

Another deputy then spotted the stolen vehicle on Border Street. Reed then lost control of the stolen vehicle and crashed into a tree at the intersection of Border Street and Bobe Street. Responding deputies arriving on scene knocked the back window out of the vehicle in order to get the passenger door open to render first aid due to the deputies observing the suspect to be unresponsive, Roy said.

Reed was transported to an area hospital where he died from his injuries. There were no other vehicles involved in the crash and no other injuries to any civilians or deputies. Investigators used fingerprints to identify Reed.
