BLYTHEVILLE, AR (KAIT) - Prosecuting Attorney Scott Ellington said in a letter to Arkansas State Police that a Blytheville police officer will not be prosecuted in the April 7 officer-involved shooting.

The officer, identified in the letter as Leann Norman, responded to the Dodge Store on South Division Street in response to a store employee being attacked.

Employees told Officer Norman that the suspect, identified as Marzues Scott, left in the direction of the Deerfield In Hotel.

The letter said Norman encountered the suspect it the hotelâ€™s parking lot.

She told Scott to stop and come to her, but he ignored her orders the letter said.

Norman then encountered Scott on Kari Lane, where he continued to ignore her command.

He then turned around and approached Norman while becoming aggressive at the same time.

She told Scott to stop and backed away, a command he again ignored.

Norman drew her gun and pointed it at Scott, telling him to say back and to get on the ground, the letter said.

Scott hit Norman in the face and head several times, the letter said, knocking her to the ground.

She fired her gun which struck Scott, but he continued to approach the officer aggressively while she was on the ground, Ellington told state police.

She ordered Scott to stay back, but he did not listen to her command, the letter said.

Norman fired another shot, hitting Scott again. That time he fell to the ground.

The letter stated that Norman radioed to dispatch, saying shots were fired and asked for an ambulance to be sent to the scene.

Scott was taken to Great River Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Ellington said the letter that Officer Norman was reasonable in believing that her life was in danger when she fired her gun.

He said no prosecution will follow in the case, but the case remains an open investigation until all evidence from the Arkansas State Crime Lab has been completed and made part of the file.
