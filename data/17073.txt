HOLLYWOOD (CBSLA.com) — The Los Angeles County Coroner's Office Wednesday released the identity of a 29-year-old man who died in a fiery crash after colliding with a Metro van in Hollywood.

According to the coroner's office, Oscar Chavez drove the Chevrolet Camaro that barreled into a Metro maintenance van after he failed to yield to officers during a routine traffic stop.

Just before 2 a.m. on Monday, authorities were sent to the 6000 block of Hollywood Boulevard, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department.

Upon their arrival, firefighters located a sole occupant inside the Metro van, which was engulfed in flames.

Paramedics pronounced the Metro driver, who worked as a custodian, dead at the scene. Family members have identified him as 50-year-old Willie Toy, of South Los Angeles, who was a father of eight.

According to a Metro spokesperson, Toy was likely on his way to clean the subway station when the crash occurred.

Chavez was transported to a hospital in critical condition where he later died.

A preliminary investigation revealed Chavez fled from the traffic stop as a patrol officer was walking back to his vehicle to verify the driver's information.

Investigators are working to determine if he was impaired at the time of the crash and if he had a criminal record.

A woman who traveled in the vehicle with Chavez has been cooperating with police.

The investigation is continuing.
