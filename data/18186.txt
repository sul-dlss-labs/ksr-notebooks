OAK PARK (CBS) -- A 17-year-old boy suspected in a west suburban carjacking jumped to his death from an Eisenhower Expressway overpass while trying to run away from authorities Friday night, according to Illinois State Police.

About 8:15 p.m., state troopers joined Hillside police in a chase on Interstate 290 after four people stole a vehicle at gunpoint earlier in the day.

The vehicle stopped on the overpass at Harlem and the four suspects got out, police said. One jumped down to the expressway and died.

The teen was identified by the Cook County medical examiner's office as Tyrece Coleman of the 7400 block of South St. Lawrence in Chicago. An autopsy Saturday did not rule on his cause or manner of death, with final results pending further investigation.

Two more suspects were arrested and the fourth got away, police said.

All lanes of I-290 were shut down about 8:30 p.m. at Harlem. Blue Line service was halted between 8:45 p.m. and 9:15 p.m. after a report of a person on the tracks nearby, according to the CTA.

All lanes were re-opened early Saturday morning.
