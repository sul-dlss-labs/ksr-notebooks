A man who was shot and killed by Tucson police last week during a confrontation at a west-side park has been identified as Michael Gale, 28.

Gale was shot Jan. 18 after he pointed a handgun toward two police officers who found him in the park near North Riverside Avenue and West Sonora Street, police said at the time.

Tucson police received reports of a shirtless man kicking fences in the area at the time.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The two police officers who shot him were identified as Officers Benjamin Boschee and Colin Hyde. They were not injured.
