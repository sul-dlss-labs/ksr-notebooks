What started as a robbery came to a violent end outside of the Tops Friendly Market on East 38th Street, after police open fire on an armed suspect.

“It’s unfortunate that this was necessitated,” said Erie FBI Special Agent Brian Fox. “But we’re happy that no bystanders were injured and no law enforcement officers were injured.”

According to police, it all began around 2:45 p.m. Wednesday, after they received reports of a bank robbery.

Witnesses at the scene say the suspect robbed the Widget Financial branch on East 38th and led police on a chase.

According to Erie Police Chief Randy Bowers, officers caught up with the man behind Tops where a getaway vehicle was parked.

At that point, Chief Bowers says a confrontation ensued, and officers shot and killed the suspect.
