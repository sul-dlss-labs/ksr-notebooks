A Los Angeles Police Department officer driving a bomb squad vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian early Monday in a Del Rey neighborhood, authorities said.

Sgt. Barry Montgomery told reporters an on-duty officer was driving the vehicle just after midnight when he accidentally struck the man in the 13600 block of Culver Boulevard.

The officer knew he had struck something, so he returned to the area and searched until he found the man on the side of the road, Montgomery said.
