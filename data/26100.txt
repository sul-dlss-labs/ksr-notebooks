MIAMI GARDENS, FLâ€” Miami-Dade police officers opened fire on a man who was allegedly brandishing a rifle and handgun on Monday afternoon in a Miami Gardens neighborhood where investigators had been conducting a surveillance operation. The man was pronounced dead on the scene by Miami-Dade Fire Rescue personnel.

He was identified as 45-year-old Ronnie Angelo Churches. The incident happened around 1:30 p.m. in the 20400 block of NW 23 Court, explained Detective Lee Cowart of the Miami-Dade Police Department. "Miami-Dade Police, Homicide Street Violence Task Force detectives, were following investigative leads in Sunday's brutal murder of Roberto Cardenas," Cowart said, adding that the officers were confronted by Churches.

"No one else was injured during the incident," he said. "Preliminary information received thus far indicates that a rifle and handgun has been recovered from the scene." A woman told WPLG TV that Churches was killed in a gun battle with police. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement has opened an investigation into the shooting as with all police-involved shootings in Miami-Dade County.
