A man was killed, and another was injured Sunday in a crash on the Southwest Side near Midway Airport.

About 11:10 p.m., authorities from an outside agency saw a Red Kia sedan traveling northbound on Cicero Avenue, Chicago police said. The driver ran a red light at the intersection of South State Road and Cicero.

Authorities tried pulling the car over as it sped off on Cicero, police said. They found it had crashed into a viaduct in the 5900 block of South Cicero Avenue.

A male inside the car was found unresponsive and was pronounced dead on the scene, police said.

The Cook County medical examiner’s office identified him as 43-year-old Andres Nevarez of Chicago Lawn. An autopsy ruled his death an accident.

A 33-year-old man who was a passenger in the Kia was taken to Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn in critical condition, police said. Details about his injuries weren’t immediately available.
