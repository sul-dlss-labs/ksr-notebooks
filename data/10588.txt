WARREN â€“ A local man is dead after having a Taser used on him by Warren police.

According to family members, Richard Kokenos was home alone and ran out of the house barefoot for unknown reasons on Kendall Street in Warren. Then he started banging on several doors and windows along Eureka Street.

?To me he wasn?t threatening,? said one neighbor.

But others called police, fearful the man yelling ?help, let me in? was breaking into their home. Witnesses said he was seen slamming his body into the wall of one house.

One witness tells Local 4, Kokenos did put up a fight and it wasn?t until he broke out of a squad car that an officer tased him.

His family and friends believe something different happened.

?From what I?ve heard they tased him, cuffed him, put him in the car, let him out the car and tased him twice more,? said family friend Laurie Johnson. ?Richard was very humble spirited, never hurt anybody. Nothing he could have done deserved for him to be tased like that.?

According to family, the 27 year-old died shortly after midnight early Saturday morning.

His mother wonders if Warren police is to blame.

?Yes I do,? said Kokenos?s mother Annie Hawkins. ?I?m not sure, but it has to be. Three times, one time is enough isn?t it??

Michigan State Police will handle the investigation.

Mayor Fouts said, "Whenever there is a loss of life involving the police, it is important that this city and in particular the department reflect transparency. Allowing the Michigan State Police to investigate this incident is a prudent and wise decision."
