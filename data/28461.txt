Though only 30, Kyle A. Elrod already had been in and out of prison twice for sex offenses, a credit card crime and drugs.

So, during a traffic stop early Wednesday morning, he made a final vow from the back seat of the Honda as two Cleveland County sheriff deputies and an Oklahoma City police sergeant approached.

"I'm not going back," Elrod said.

The two other people in the car said Elrod then "pulled a pistol and began firing at the officers," police reported in a request Wednesday to search the car. Police in a news release Thursday said Elrod "began to point the gun at one of the deputies."

"Both deputies and the officer discharged their firearms at Elrod," police said. "Elrod was struck and later pronounced deceased at the scene."

No one else was injured.

The deputies were identified as Colten Harris and rookie Jordan Norris. The police sergeant was identified as Julian Barrie. They have been placed on administrative leave.

Deputies made the stop on SW 89 Street in Oklahoma City around 1:35 a.m. Wednesday. The police sergeant came to check on the deputies. Police did not disclose in the search request or the new release the reason for the stop. Police identified the other two people in the car as males, 25 and 16. They were released after being interviewed.

Police reported collecting a spent shell casing and fired projectiles from the car.

Elrod first went to prison in 2016 for a drug crime and for second-degree rape. He was incarcerated again last year for failing to register as a sex offender and for a credit card crime.

In the rape case, he said he had sex with a 14-year-old girl in his girlfriend's car while he was under the influence of methamphetamine.

He said in court paperwork that he had been treated in the past for schizophrenia and for a bipolar condition.
