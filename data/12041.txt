When officers approached a vehicle matching the description of the suspects' vehicle, Warren put the car in reverse and drove towards the officers, hitting an unmarked patrol car, police said.



Shots were fired as the car continued to flee, hitting other parked cars before coming to a stop.



Warren was pronounced dead at the scene and Parks was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition. None of the officers were injured.



Police are still investigating the incident and are asking anyone with information to call Miami-Dade Crime Stoppers at 305-471-TIPS.
