New details in this weekend's officer involved shooting are emerging.



Investigators now say the suspect who was killed was not armed at the time of the shooting. Police identified him as Robert Coleman, 30, of Flowery Branch. They say the knife used in the stabbing at 3668 Willow Wood Way was found in that home. Coleman was shot while officers searched a home at 3849 Smokemist Trace, three blocks away.



Coleman reportedly attacked one of the officers searching the second home, knocking him to the ground.



"The primary officer fired shots at Coleman, fearing for his life," said Gwinnett County Police Cpl. Jake Smith in a release. "The secondary officer also fired shots at Coleman, fearing for the life of the primary officer."



The first officer was shot in the leg. His injury is being considered "friendly fire," although it is still unclear who's gun fired the bullet.



Both officers were placed on administrative leave.
