The two officers involved in a fatal shooting behind Bill’s Bottle Store have been cleared to return to patrol following an internal review and a “no bill” ruling by a Midland County grand jury.

After hearing evidence from a Texas Rangers investigation, a Midland County grand jury ruled Wednesday afternoon that Sgt. Gregory Snow and Officer Dayton Weatherford were found to have committed no criminal wrongdoing in the June 6 shooting of 42-year-old Joe Nevels who charged at one of the officers with a box cutter after disregarding their commands.

Nevel was pronounced dead at Midland Memorial Hospital after the incident, which occurred behind the shop located at the intersection of Midland Drive and Neely Avenue.

Both officers were placed on administrative leave per MPD policy immediately following the incident and a Texas Rangers investigation was launched.

An internal MPD administrative review board found the two officers to be in compliance with all state/federal laws and department policy late Thursday afternoon.

Snow has been with the department for 16 years; Weatherford has been with the department approximately one and a half years.
