OKLAHOMA CITY– Two Oklahoma City police officers have been placed on administrative leave after an officer-involved shooting that left one man dead.

Around 3:00 p.m. on July 4, police were called to an apartment complex in the 4200 block of SE 54th.

Police say callers reported a man with a gun was walking around vehicles in the parking lot.

“It was a man with a gun but the information on the call stated that the suspect was just walking around and obviously had a firearm but was checking cars as if he was trying to steal one,” Capt. Paco Balderrama said.

Officers along with air support from OKCPD helicopter Air 1 searched for the suspect.

When officers arrived to the scene, a witness pointed out the suspect, 42-year-old Robert Elando Malone.

As soon as officers spotted Malone, police say the suspect started to run.

Officers and Air 1 followed the suspect through the complex.

Police say Malone eventually raised a gun in the direction of Air 1.

That is when an officer fired in the direction of Malone.

Police say the man then lowered his gun and pointed it at the officers on the scene.

Two police officers then fired their weapons, striking Malone.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The officers, Sgt. Edward D. Moiser and Sgt. Joey Laughead, were not hurt, but have been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of an investigation into the shooting.

It is unclear right now if the suspect shot at the officers.
