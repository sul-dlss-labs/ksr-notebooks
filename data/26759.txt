FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. — Fayetteville police have identified a man who died in police custody after being detained by officers last week.

Joshua Oxendine, 34, died while in police custody during the early morning hours of Sept. 12, but authorities have not yet publicly disclosed his cause of death.

Fayetteville Police Department officers responded to the 800 block of East Orange Street, where there were reports of a man going door-to-door acting strangely, around 12:20 a.m.

A Cumberland County Sheriff's Office deputy later saw the man jumping on the hood of a vehicle on Ramsey Street near Webb Street and stopped to investigate. Fayetteville police officers arrived to help.

Oxendine became aggressive when law enforcement officers made contact with him, the police department said, and began to beat on the hood of the deputy's patrol car.

Law enforcement officers took the man to the ground to handcuff and secure him, the police department said.

“Within a minute, the officers realized his breathing had changed," police Chief Gina Hawkins said. "They unhandcuffed him and began rescue CPR."

She said her officers did not use a choke hold, p epper spray or taser during the incident with Oxendine.

The medical examiner will determine the cause of death.
