The village police chief who was wounded last week in Chevak apparently was unarmed.

The man who shot the officer subsequently killed himself.

Village Police Chief Derek McDonald responded to reports of an intoxicated man, later identified as Harold Paniyak, 24, wielding a firearm, according to Alaska State Troopers.

McDonald responded to the call with no firearm of his own, and was shot in the chest by Paniyak with a .35-caliber pistol, the report said.

After McDonald fell to the ground, Paniyak fired at least two additional rounds into the officer.

McDonald still managed to flee the scene, helping witnesses take cover in the local Head Start building.

Paniyak pursued them while still holding the firearm, and unsuccessfully attempted to enter the building, the report said.

Shortly after that, Paniyak shot himself in the chest with the pistol.

This is one of many instances in recent years in which rural police officers have gone into dangerous situations without a weapon, and have ended up victims themselves.

In 2014 the state passed a law allowing village public safety officers to carry guns, but not all officers have chosen to go through the training and take up arms â€” something that can be difficult for short-staffed departments to find the time and funds to do.

Village police officers like McDonald always have had the option of undergoing training to carry firearms, but their departments also may be restricted by time, available personnel, and money.

Many officers rely on the State Troopers to resolve tense conflicts, but this is not always possible in cases where residents are in immediate danger.

Village police officers are often forced to enter these situations armed only with pepper spray, a taser and the hope that they will be able to resolve the issue peacefully.

McDonald was still receiving care in an Anchorage hospital for severe injuries at the time of this report.
