Chicago police fatally shot a male late Friday after seeing him shoot another man, according to officials.

Chicago police officers were in a marked car about 11:50 p.m. Friday patrolling the area when they came across the male involved in a skirmish with another in the 2000 block of West 69th Street in the West Englewood neighborhood on the city's South Side, said Sgt. Al Stinites, spokesman for the department.

Officers witnessed the male shooting at a man, Stinites said. The officers stopped and got out of their car. The officers announced their positions and ordered the male attacker to drop his weapon, according to a news release.

At this point, the male attacker was still shooting at the man, Stinites said.

One of the officers then shot the attacker, fatally wounding him, Stinites said. The male, whose age was not known, was later pronounced dead.

The 26-year-old man wounded by the attacker was shot in the abdomen, police said. He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center, where his condition was stabilized.

The shooter's weapon was recovered by officers at the scene, according to a news release.

There weren't any officers injured in the shooting. The officer who fatally shot the offender has been placed on a 30-day administrative leave, Stinites said.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting. Mia Sissac, spokeswoman for IPRA, confirmed early Saturday that the agency was investigating the shooting, but she declined to further comment on the incident.

She said investigators will be looking at any evidence including videos of the incident. If the shooting was recorded, Sissac said the video will be made public within 60 days.
