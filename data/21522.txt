SPANISH FORK, Utah July 21, 2017 (Gephardt Daily) â€” A 19-year-old male is dead and an 18-year-old male wounded, in the aftermath of two separate shootings sparked by an early morning confrontation outside Spanish Fork High School.

According to police, the first shooting took place about 2:20 a.m. as a large group of adults and juveniles were present in the parking lot to witness a planned fight.

Spanish Fork Police Lt. Matt Johnson told Gephardt Daily trouble started when an 18-year-old male was exchanging words with the 19-year-old passenger of a car who then pointed a pistol at the teen. The 18-year-old tried to grab the gun, only to be shot in the upper arm.

The car sped off, but not before the passenger fired at least four more shots over the head of those in the parking lot.

Two hours later, police in Payson spotted what they thought was the suspect vehicle and initiated a traffic stop.

As officers were preparing to approach the car, the man shot himself in the head with a .380 handgun.

Police attempted CPR, but the 19-year-old died at the scene.

The 18-year-old who was wounded in the Spanish Fork High School parking lot was treated and released from a local hospital where his injuries were described as minor.

Police have yet to release the names of the shooter or the teen he wounded.

Gephardt Daily will update the story as more information becomes available.
