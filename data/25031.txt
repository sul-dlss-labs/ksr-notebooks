A Sioux Falls man, who was tased and arrested for possession of a controlled substance and resisting arrest, died in the hospital Saturday morning.

Sioux Falls Police Public Information Officer Sam Clemens announced Joshua Langley’s death on Monday afternoon. An autopsy is scheduled to be performed on Tuesday.

Langley was arrested on October 24 for causing a disturbance inside a room at Motel 6 on West Russell Street.

Management let officers into the room, where they allegedly found the man yelling and screaming. Police tried getting him to leave but he wouldn’t, so the officers ended up tasing him. Anytime someone is tased, an ambulance is called to check on them.

After the ambulance arrived, Langley became unresponsive and stopped breathing. Paramedics were able to regain a pulse and he was taken to the hospital.

Meth was found in the room.

An autopsy is scheduled to be performed on Tuesday.
