Richard Lance London — a Danville man suspected of killing a man who had been in a relationship with his grandmother — was fatally shot by police in South Carolina early Tuesday morning.

London was a suspect in the death of Melvin Eugene Powell, 80, who was found by police Sunday afternoon at 23 Elizabeth St. In announcing London’s death, a Danville Police Department news release stated Powell’s body was found “with visible signs of violent injury.”

Danville police have not said how Powell died, or what London’s motivation was for killing Powell.

London, 22, was identified as a suspect in Powell’s death, but fled in a Mercury Sable sedan that was taken from the scene, a police news release stated.

“He was wanted on an outstanding probation violation and was entered into the National Crime Information Center as a wanted person and an armed homicide suspect,” according to the release. “The associated vehicle was also entered.”

At 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, members of the Lake City Police Department in Lake City, South Carolina, tried to stop London’s vehicle. After a short pursuit on “heavily traveled” U.S. 52, police said London “stopped the car and exited, firing a handgun at the officers.” London was shot by Lake City police and later died in a local hospital.

Danville police did not specify why London was in South Carolina. “At this time there are no other suspects in the murder of Melvin Powell,” according to the release.

London was charged four times in the past four years with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, according to online court records in Danville. He was last wanted for a probation violation.

Danville police have found no leads to any family members of Powell. Anyone having knowledge of living relatives of Melvin Powell are requested to call (434) 799-6508.
