CAIRO, GA (WALB) - We now know what caused the death of a Cairo man, hours after he was arrested for disorderly conduct.

Toxicology results show that 58-year-old Franklin Lee died of a heart condition.

Officers used pepper spray when they arrested him in December as he was intoxicated at a Cairo Hardee's.

He was placed in a holding cell at the Grady County Detention center, where a jailer later found him unresponsive.

"What caused his death, according to the autopsy, was natural due to hypertension and cardiovascular disease and another type of cardiovascular disease that he already had," said Steve Turner GBI Special Agent In Charge.

The GBI says the use of pepper spray had no relation to Lee's death.
