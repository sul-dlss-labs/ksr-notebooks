An innocent man is dead after a high-speed chase suspect crashed into his truck killing him instantly, troopers said.

Around 11:30 p.m. Thursday, Oklahoma Highway Patrol said a driver sped past troopers heading east on Interstate 40 near I-235.

The driver, 20-year-old James Cawthorne, was estimated by troopers to be going around 100 mph.

“By the time he (trooper) caught up to the vehicle, now they’re starting to go northbound on I-35 from I-40,” said OHP Major Ronnie Hampton.

Troopers continued chasing Cawthrone. The minutes long chase ended at Northeast 10th Street and Sunnylane when Cawthrone crashes into a pickup truck.

Hampton said it all unfolded within minutes.

“From the time the trooper sees someone go past him at a high rate of speed and engages his red lights trying to make a traffic stop, two minutes (pass) and we have a car crash,” said Hampton. “(It) happened very fast.”

Troopers said Cory Coffey, 38, died instantly in his pickup truck.

Family said he had a passion for training horses and helping people, working with alcohol and drug addicts.

“He was a fun, loving, sensitive, spiritual, Christian young man that loved horses,” said Robin Coffey, Cory’s mother. “By the time he came out of my belly, his daddy put him on a horse.”

Cawthorne was arrested on multiple complaints including first degree murder, driving under the influence, speeding, and driving in violation of license restriction.

A mother is now left with last words that her son will never hear.

“I love him, and I am going to miss you, that's it,” said Coffey.

Cawthorne was arrested just last month for allegedly speeding and driving under the influence, reports show.

Family said Cory had no insurance. A GoFundMe page has been set up to help the family.
