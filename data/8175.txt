PHILADELPHIA -- A woman has died after being hit

by a car being chased by Philadelphia police that crashed into a crowd

. Three children, at least one of them hers, also were hit and killed.

Albert Einstein Medical Center spokeswoman Judy Horwitz says 22-year-old Latoya Smith died Thursday morning.

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey says Wednesday night's crash in the city's Feltonville neighborhood began with two men stealing a motorcycle at gunpoint. One man fled on the motorcycle, and the other sped away in a car. Police were pursuing the car when it jumped the curb and hit the crowd in front of Smith's house. All the children killed were under age 10. Mayor Michael Nutter says the scene was "horrific."

The car's driver was arrested at the scene. The motorcycle rider was arrested at his home.

Philadelphia police say the two men arrested, 18-year-old Donta Cradock and 20-year-old Ivan Rodriguez, have lengthy criminal records. They have been charged in the theft of a motorcycle that police say prompted the chase and are awaiting further charges.

Police say the victims were Smith, her 11-month-old daughter Remedy, 7-year-old Gina Rosario and 6-year-old Alicia Griffin.
