A Providence man has died following a crash Tuesday night that stemmed from a police pursuit on Route 6.

Police say they’re still investigating why the driver, identified as Alpha Williams, fled a traffic stop around 7 p.m. before crashing near the Hartford Avenue exit, resulting in the death of his passenger, identified as David Johnson, 47.

According to Johnston Deputy Police Chief Joseph Razza, an officer was patrolling the area of Atwood Avenue and spotted Williams, who appeared to be speeding before making an abrupt turn onto Route 6 eastbound towards Providence.

The officer pulled Williams over near the Killingly Street off-ramp and said neither man could provide identification. When the officer returned to the cruiser, Williams took off at a high rate of speed.

The officer gave chase, police said, but lost sight of Williams’ vehicle until it was found crashed into a guardrail.

“An unfortunate accident,” Razza said Wednesday. “We still don’t know why Mr. Williams has fled the scene and like I said, this was a routine traffic stop that is still under investigation.”

Police said Johnson was ejected from the vehicle and was later pronounced dead at Rhode Island Hospital.

Williams, 47, of Providence, was taken to the hospital with serious injuries. He’s since been released with a summons to appear in court April 2 on misdemeanor charges of eluding a police officer in a high speed pursuit and driving without a license. Police said additional charges against him are pending.

Razza said Johnson was wanted on several outstanding arrest warrants and both he and Williams have lengthy criminal histories.
