Police said the shooting happened in the 200 block of James Moore Drive on Wednesday afternoon.

Shortly after 3 p.m., officers responded to a domestic disturbance call. When they arrived, the man's wife told police that he had been drinking alcohol and was belligerent.

The officers then encountered 52-year-old Thomas Lagano outside the front door of the home armed with a rifle.

Authorities said the man refused commands from officers to drop the weapon, and when he pointed it at the officers, one of them shot the subject.

Lagano was air-lifted to Grady Memorial Hospital to be treated for his injuries. No officers were injured.
