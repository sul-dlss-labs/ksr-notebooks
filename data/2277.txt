HARVEY â€” A woman was killed and two people, including a Harvey police sergeant, were injured when a mini-van apparently pulled in front of the officer's squad car Sunday, police said.

Mamie Burrell, 68, of Harvey was pronounced dead at St. James Hospital and Health Center in Olympia Fields, said a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office.

At about 4:30 p.m., the sergeant was traveling west on Sibley Boulevard with lights and siren activated when a blue Plymouth mini-van heading south on Cooper Avenue pulled into the intersection, Harvey Mayor Nicholas Graves said.

The driver, identified as Burrell's husband, was taken to Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey, along with the sergeant, said Dixmoor police Sgt. Keder Jones.

A hospital official said injuries to both men appeared minor, and it was unclear whether they would be admitted to the hospital.

Police believed the man did not hear or see the squad car, Graves and Jones said.

Police do not expect to cite the driver, Jones said.
