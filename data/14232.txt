RANCHO CUCAMONGA — A woman who led Montclair police on car chase that ended a fatal crash in Claremont pleaded not guilty to murder and other felony charges Tuesday.

The San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office charged Gabrielle Wines, 28, with murder, burglary and causing death while evading a police officer, police said.

Robert Joseph Williams, 39, of Anaheim jumped into Wines’ car Sunday night after allegedly snatching two 32-inch televisions from a Target at 9050 Central Ave. and dashing out of a fire escape door.

The TVs were worth a combined $508.

Wines fled from police through Montclair and onto the westbound 10 Freeway.

She struck a sedan and two pickup trucks on the Indian Hill Boulevard off-ramp in Claremont.

The impact caused Williams to be thrown from the car. He died at the scene. Wines and two other people involved in the crash suffered injuries.

Wines is scheduled to return to West Valley Superior Court on April 1 for a hearing.
