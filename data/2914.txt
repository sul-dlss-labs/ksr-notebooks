For the police, there is no such thing as a routine domestic disturbance call. Emotions run high and common sense and reason usually do not. Yesterday, an officer on Staten Island stopped to take a report for a trespassing complaint, and ended up stabbed and thrown through a glass table before shooting his attacker to death, the police said.

The attacker, a former boyfriend of the woman who called the police, was identified as Russell Wimbush, 43. The officer, whose name the police would not release, was treated at Staten Island University Hospital and released. The encounter was a reminder of how careful officers must be in the volatile, charged environment of a domestic fight.

''The key word is unpredictability,'' said Eugene O'Donnell, a professor of law and police studies at John Jay College and a former New York City police officer. ''Emotion and unpredictability. It's always a call the police worry about a great deal. You really have to be on high alert. There's really no way to tell how it's going to end sometimes.''

The call came shortly before 7 a.m. yesterday from the South Beach Houses, a complex of brick apartment buildings in Grasmere, from a woman on the second floor who had seen her former boyfriend on the South Beach grounds, the police said. She had a protective order barring him from the property after earlier incidents, the police said.
