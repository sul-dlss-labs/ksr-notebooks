SAN BERNARDINO >> An armed robbery suspect led police on a chase that ended in a rollover crash resulting in the death of a San Bernardino man.

Shortly before 12:30 a.m. Friday, Dorian Perkins, 35, of San Bernardino reported to police that a group of men pulled up to him in the 500 block of West 8th Street, pointed a gun at him and told him to give them everything he had, police said.

The victim said one of the passengers got out of the SUV and grabbed the man’s belongings, police added.

He described the vehicle as a black or dark colored SUV with yellow paper plates.

Shortly before 1 a.m. a San Bernardino police patrol officer came upon a vehicle fitting that description, police said.

“As the officer attempted to initiate a traffic stop the driver of the Ford Expedition fled at a high rate of speed eastbound on Base Line,” Sgt. Carl Williams said. “The pursuit ended when the SUV rolled over at Base Line and Elm Street.”

The driver of the SUV, Jamel Miller, 25, was pronounced dead at the scene and the two juvenile passengers, one 13 years old and the other 17, in the vehicle were treated for minor injuries before being booked into San Bernardino Juvenile Hall on suspicion of armed robbery, police said.

Cal Fire and San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies assigned to the Highland station assisted police in securing the crime scene and the crash investigation. Base Line between Elm Street and Sterling Avenue was closed overnight due to the incident.

It reopened shortly before 8 a.m., police said.

Police recovered a shotgun and a flare gun from the SUV.

Anyone with information on this incident is asked to contact Detective Al Tello at 909-384-5747 or Sgt. Carl Williams at 909-693-6665.
