Hundreds gathered Sunday evening with candles, their grief pouring out in tears as they begin to say goodbye to their classmate, 13-year-old Terry DiFalco. The teen was crossing Central Avenue in Westfield on Saturday night around 8:30 when she was struck by an off-duty New Jersey State Trooper.

As flowers were laid at the scene of the accident Sunday, parents received the letter from the school principal about DiFalco’s death. The teen, heavily involved in the theater was set to have a part in the upcoming school musical Carrie.

Westfield High School principal Dr. Derrick Nelson expressed his condolences and detailed the assistance available for students and teachers. Grief counselors were available on Monday at Westfield High School as students mourned.

“It is with a heavy heart that I have informed our Westfield High School community that one of our 9th grade students was involved in a tragic accident and has passed away,” he said. “We are all devastated by these events and our heartfelt condolences go out to the entire family and friends.

Within the last 18 hours I have spoken with the police department, school administrators, teachers, and parents all wanting to help in any way they can,” Nelson said. “It is times like these that I am the most proud of our community.”

No charges have been filed against the yet-to-be-identified state trooper.
