NEW YORK -- Plainclothes police officers shot and killed a man Friday who grabbed another officer and began firing a gun on a subway platform, police said.

The three officers had detained Juan Calves, 51, and another suspect after they spotted the two men riding between subway cars on a southbound 4 train going from the New York City borough of the Bronx into Manhattan, police said.

After the officers took the suspects off the train at the 176th Street station, Calves grabbed Officer Annmarie Marchiondo in a head lock, pulled out a stolen 9-millimeter gun and fired five shots on the platform, police said.

While Marchiondo struggled to get free, the two other officers returned fire, killing Calves, police said. The two officers fired 13 shots, police said.

Marchiondo, a 17-year veteran, was shot in the foot, ankle and left side, just under her bullet-resistant vest, police said. She was hospitalized in stable condition Friday night. Police didn't immediately know who had shot Marchiondo.

Police said the platform was not crowded at the time of the shooting, about 5:20 p.m.

Calves was freed on parole from prison two years ago after serving time for manslaughter, robbery, and attempt to promote prison contraband. The manslaughter conviction involved the killing of a fellow prison inmate at Attica Correctional Facility, police said.

The second suspect, whose name wasn't immediately released, was being questioned. Charges hadn't yet been filed.

The officers had been patrolling the subways to enforce a regulation that bars passengers from jumping subway cars.

"Officer Marchiondo and police officers like her are the reason why New York City subways are the safest in memory," Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday.
