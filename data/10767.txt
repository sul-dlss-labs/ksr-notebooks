ELK GROVE (CBS13) â€“ The Sacramento County Coroner's office has identified a man killed by police after allegedly shooting a CHP officer twice Sunday evening during a routine traffic stop on Highway 99 in Elk Grove.

The coroner has identified the man as 68-year-old Richard Bisbee of Elk Grove.

Sacramento County Sheriff's deputies were at the scene of the shooting all night before finally clearing the roadway just before 7 a.m. Monday morning.

Deputies say the injured CHP officer was approaching Bisbee's vehicle during a routine stop near Elk Grove Boulevard on Highway 99 when the he opened fire, wounding the CHP officer in the wrist and hip.

The officer had called for additional support in the minutes leading up to the gunfire, according to investigators, and a second CHP officer arrived at the scene within a few moments and returned fire as Bisbee attempted to drive away.

Bisbee's vehicle swerved almost immediately and overturned off the shoulder of the roadway, deputies said.

Officers from a number of different law enforcement agencies surrounded the vehicle and ordered Bisbee to surrender. Witnesses said the officers shouted commands to surrender multiple times, but after an Elk Grove officer spotted a threat, he opened fire, fatally wounding Bisbee.

The injured officer was tended to by other officers and an off-duty nurse who happened by the scene. He was rushed to Kaiser South hospital, where he is being treated for his injuries. The officer, who is in his 30s and is described as a rookie CHP officer, is out of surgery and is described as being in stable condition and good spirits.

Bisbee had two dogs in the car with him. They were safely removed from the car.

Both the injured CHP officer and the Elk Grove Police officer involved in the shooting will be placed on administrative leave per their department's policies.
