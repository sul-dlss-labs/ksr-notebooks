A man was killed in an exchange of gunfire with police in the northwest Alabama city of Tuscumbia early this morning, the authorities said.

Kenneth Sashington, 38, was declared dead at the scene, said Colbert County Coroner Justin Gasque. Sashington’s body was sent for autopsy at the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences.

Officers were called just before 4 a.m. to investigate a report of a “suspicious person” banging on doors at an apartment complex on Trenholm Memorial Drive, said police Chief Tony Logan. When officers found a man at the apartment complex, he fired shots at them, according to the chief.

After an exchange of gunfire, Logan said, the man ran. Additional shots were fired after a brief chase, and the man was killed.

The chief said none of the officers suffered any serious injuries.

Tuscumbia police said the State Bureau of Investigation and Colbert County District Attorney’s office are investigating the deadly incident. Those agencies didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

Logan said he will conduct an interval review and meet with the investigating agencies to determine whether any officers should be put on leave.
