A 67-year-old Brooklyn man was killed yesterday after being struck by a police car responding to an emergency call.

The man, Steven Michalacos, of Sunset Park, was struck about 2 p.m. as he was crossing Fifth Avenue near 80th Street in Bay Ridge, apparently unaware of the approaching car, according to the police.

He was pronounced dead at Lutheran Medical Center.

A police spokeswoman, Cheryl Cox, said last night that Mr. Michalacos walked into the path of the approaching car, which had its siren and emergency lights on. She said the car was responding to a report of a theft from someone in a bank building, but the location of the bank remained unclear.

The officers in the car were not injured. Officer Cox said the incident was under investigation by the department's accident investigation unit, which is routine in serious cases.
