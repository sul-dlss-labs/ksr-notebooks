The California Highway Patrol Monday investigated the fatal crash of a motorcyclist in Orange during a high-speed pursuit by CHP officers, authorities said.

The Orange County coroner’s office did not immediately release the suspect’s name, pending family notification. The CHP said he was a 23-year-old resident of Anaheim riding a 2006 Suzuki.

The chase began on the northbound Santa Ana (5) Freeway near the Costa Mesa (55) Freeway at about 1:55 a.m. Sunday, the CHP said in a release.

The motorcyclist then exited the 5 freeway at Grand Avenue heading north from Santa Ana into Orange with the CHP in pursuit.

Once in Orange, the motorcyclist continued north on Glassell Street until failing to negotiate a turn and hitting a curb at the Plaza Square circle at the intersection of Glassell and Chapman Avenue, said the CHP. The motorcyclist was thrown off the motorcycle and suffered fatal injuries..

The pursuit began over the motorcyclist allegedly speeding on the 5 Freeway and then refusing to pull over when a CHP unit tried to make a traffic stop, a news videographer reported from the scene. The chase hit speeds of 90 miles an hour, according to the CHP.
