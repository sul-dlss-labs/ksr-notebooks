The Omaha Police Department is conducting an in-custody death investigation after a man shot himself in the head Saturday morning in the presence of an officer.

Two officers were checking on a reported domestic dispute at a house near North 22nd and Browne streets around 6:30 a.m. A woman and several children on the porch appeared distressed and motioned for the officers to come over. When one officer reached the porch, he could see a man standing in the living room pointing a gun at his head.

One officer entered the house while the other stayed in the doorway to protect the family. The officer who went inside attempted to communicate with 34-year-old Nathan Smith, but he refused to talk. Smith pulled the trigger, but the gun did not fire. He then retreated farther into the house, put the gun back to his head and pulled the trigger again. This time the gun fired.

Smith was taken to CHI Health Creighton University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

OPD's Officer-Involved Investigation Team is looking into the incident, considered an in-custody death because a police officer was present when Smith shot himself. Per state law, a grand jury will also be convened to investigate.
