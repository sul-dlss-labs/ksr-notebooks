The man critically wounded Friday in an officer-involved shooting at a hotel has died, according to Tempe Police Detective Jaime Garibay.

Jonathan L. Williams, 25, of Kansas and Florida was shot at about 6:30 p.m. Friday after he fired at Tempe police officers in the lobby of a Motel 6 at 1612 N. Scottsdale Road, Lt. Scott Smith, a department spokesman said.

Police first responded to the area Thursday night after Williams reportedly assaulted his 24-year-old girlfriend, Smith said.

She fled to the lobby of a second motel and Williams followed her into the lobby, where he knocked a cup of coffee off the counter and threatened the motel clerk, Smith said. Williams fled before police arrived.

Tempe police returned on Friday to the Motel 6 after Williams had been spotted in the lobby, Smith said. Officers formed a team to contact Williams, who Smith said pulled out a handgun after exiting and re-entering the empty lobby.

Williams pointed and fired the handgun at police, Smith said. He was hit when an officer outside the lobby returned fire.

Williams was taken to a hospital, where he later died, authorities said.
