PHOENIX (AP) â€” A Peoria police officer was critically wounded and a suspect killed during an early morning shooting in this west Phoenix suburb.

Officer Bill Weigt, 31, was being treated at John C. Lincoln Hospital-North Mountain in Phoenix, Peoria police spokesman Mike Tellef said. He was wearing a bulletproof vest but suffered a bullet wound to the upper chest. Although listed in critical condition, Tellef said he was "stable."

The unidentified 27-year-old male suspect was dead on arrival at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix.

The incident began at 4:22 a.m. when Weigt was responding to a shooting call and saw a vehicle leaving the area, Tellef said.

A short chase began, but the suspect's vehicle blew a front tire and stopped. Police said the man stepped out of the car and started shooting at Weigt and other backup officers, then ran. The officers chased him and at least five returned fire. Tellef said the suspect was shot several times.

Meanwhile, a 21-year-old man was found dead at home that was the site of the original shooting call, Tellef said.

Police were searching for one suspect who ran from that home.

Detectives were still trying to determine other details, Tellef said, and were talking to witnesses.

Weigt is married with children and has been a Peoria police officer for a year and a half.

No Peoria police officer has a lost a life in the line of duty, according to Officer Down Memorial Page Inc., a Web site that tracks fallen officers throughout the nation.
