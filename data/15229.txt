MEMPHIS, Tenn.- Close friends of the man shot and killed by Southaven Police identify the man as Tim Rook. A man WREG uncovered is a convicted felon.

“How are you feeling now? Your friend, your friend`s son, has been shot and killed by,” asked WREG’s Elise Preston.

“Oh Lord, I feel sorrow,” replied Gary Pettit.

Pettit lives in the Nutbush area of Memphis. He identified Rook as a drinking buddy of his, whose family lives right down the street.

“Has he ever been in trouble before?” asked Preston.

“Oh yes, he has. Why lie about it? He was a good person you know, but he would get in his drinking mood and all that stuff,” replied Pettit.

Southaven police say; they pulled Rook over Saturday, suspecting he just vandalized a house on Hillbrook Road. Police say the convicted felon refused to get out of his car. When he finally did, he had a gun in his hand. Witnesses tell WREG that`s when police sprayed Rook`s car with gunfire.

“I don`t even know what happened. But if he pulled a gun on police, no I do not blame them. I do not blame them,” said Pettit.

“I mean that sounds like something he would do,” said friend Daniel Hunt.

Friends say they aren`t surprised because just two years ago; Rook was arrested after he shot at a man and his family, including a 3-month-old baby.

Pettit and other friends are remembering Rook as a man they say loved to have fun, but one who also became reckless when he had too much fun.

“I ain’t tell him nothing because he wouldn`t listen to you. Bless his heart through, he was a good a friend,” said Pettit.

Because Rook is a convicted felon, he should not have had a gun.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is investigating the shooting.
