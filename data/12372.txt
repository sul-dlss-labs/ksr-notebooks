A man was shot and killed Friday morning during a confrontation with police in Monterey Park.

No officers were injured in the shooting involving Monterey Park police just after midnight in the 400 block of Atlantic Boulevard

Police responding to a disturbance call at or near a hotel were directed to a vehicle leaving the location. It was not clear whether the domestic dispute call originated at the hotel, said detective Dameron Peyton, of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which is assisting Monterey Park police in the investigation.

A male passenger with a handgun exited the vehicle and officers opened fire, said Peyton. There were “multiple shots fired” and a gun was recovered at the scene, Peyton said.
