Christopher Allen Taylor, a 19-year-old black man, was fatally shot by police Thursday, February 21, in the 6400 block of Keynote Street in Long Beach, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Long Beach police shot and killed Taylor, who was suspected of stealing a vehicle after he allegedly opened fire on officers early Thursday, officials said.

California Highway Patrol officers chased the vehicle -- apparently stolen from a Redondo Beach home -- into Long Beach but lost sight of Taylor as he exited the southbound 405 Freeway at Studebaker Road about 1 a.m., Long Beach police Officer Marlene Arrona told KTLA-TV (Channel 5).

Long Beach officers spotted the vehicle shortly afterward, prompting a second chase that ended when the suspect crashed into a home in the 6400 block of Keynote Street, Arrona said.

"The suspect pointed a handgun at the officers, shot at the officers, and an officer-involved shooting occurred," Arrona told the TV station.

Taylor was pronounced dead at the scene.

Anyone with information about the case can calll Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS.
