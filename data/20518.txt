A review by the county prosecutor’s office of a June 2017 bank robbery where police shot and killed the suspected robber found the three officers involved acted lawfully.

Centralia’s David W. Hamilton, 50, was shot and killed following a bank robbery reported at the iQ Credit Union branch at 15705 N.E. Fourth Plain Blvd. on the afternoon of June 6.

The robber, later identified as Hamilton, entered wearing a ski mask and wielding a semi-automatic rifle, according to police.

Hamilton left the credit union and got in a white Volvo, drove to a nearby Safeway parking lot, hopped in a purple Nissan parked there, and drove away.

After Hamilton led officers on a short chase, they ran him off the road near the intersection of Northeast 182nd Avenue and 73rd Street.
