A man with a long criminal history and who was due to soon report to prison was shot by sheriff's deputies during a botched undercover drug sting in County Club Hills.



Nyarko Johnson, 37, of the 15400 block of Albany Street in Markham, later died as a result from his injuries.



Four other men were arrested and four deputies were injured, but not seriously.



The incident occurred at around 1:45 p.m. Thursday near a shopping center 167th and Pulaski Road in the far south suburb.



The deputies were trying to make a "major" purchase of drugs from the men when the deal went bad. The men tried to get away from the scene and struck the officers, who were in an unmarked police SUV.



"In the course of apprehending them... there was a decent amount of mayhem," said Cook County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Liane Jackson.



A gun and a kilo of cocaine were recovered on the scene, a source told NBC Chicago.



Witnesses said they saw a silver Cadillac speeding through the parking lot near the Wal-Mart store and go behind a fast food restaurant. When it emerged, it was being followed by an SUV and gunfire was exchanged.



"I was just concerned about bullets flying, because we heard bullets. I think I went through shock at one point because I could not drive and get the car to move," said witness Marie Butler.



Once Johnson, who was driving the vehicle, stopped, police swarmed the vehicle with guns drawn, another witness said. Johnson was shot and left blood on the vehicle and concrete as he crawled away.



He was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn and initially listed in critical condition. The sheriff's deputies were taken to Advocate South Suburban Hospital in Hazel Crest for observation.



Portions of the parking lot of the adjacent shopping center were closed while authorities investigated.
