LAS CRUCES — The man who was involved in a shooting last month at the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 25 near Las Cruces was pronounced dead on Friday, federal authorities said.

Officials said the shooting occurred shortly after 6 p.m. April 9 when the man was driving through the checkpoint and was referred to a secondary inspection.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection said the man brandished a handgun as he was being questioned and then fired one shot through his car in the direction of Border Patrol agents. Agents returned gunfire and then secured the scene and administered first aid. No agents were hurt.

An FBI spokesmen confirmed Friday that man shot himself and was not struck by agents. The man died at a local hospital.

Authorities said the man’s name will not be identified because no charges will be filed.

The incident was investigated by the FBI and U.S. Customs and Border Protection Office of Professional Responsibility. The FBI El Paso Division Evidence Response Team also assisted.

Several days before the shooting, another driver died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after an encounter at the Border Patrol checkpoint on Interstate 10 west of Las Cruces.

New Mexico State Police reported that on April 4, a vehicle suspected in a road rage incident was found at the checkpoint. Police said driver became argumentative with agents and drove off.

The vehicle’s tires were flattened by spike strips, police said.

The driver then drove across the westbound lanes, through the median, across the eastbound lanes hitting a fence and going over an embankment before coming to rest in a field.

When Border Patrol agents approached the vehicle, they found driver dead with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Police have not released the driver’s identity.
