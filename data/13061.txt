PHOENIX â€“ Phoenix police say a man was shot and killed as he threatened an officer with butcher knives Saturday night.

Phoenix police Sgt. Tommy Thompson said officers responded to a domestic violence call at an apartment near 7th Street and McDowell Road where a man in his 30s was reportedly threatening to kill his father.

When they arrived, the man who answered the door had two butcher knives raised in a threatening manner.

Thompson said the man, 34-year-old Todd Allan Ferguson, told the officer who was moving back to kill him.

The officer ordered Ferguson to stop but he continued to advance toward the officer outside the apartment and continued to tell the officer to kill him.

Thompson said Ferguson got within several feet of the officer who then fired at him to end the threat.

Ferguson died at the scene. The officer was not injured.
