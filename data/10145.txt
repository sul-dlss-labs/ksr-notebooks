Utility Ameren Corp. said Thursday that its net income declined 30 percent in the first quarter as electricity and natural gas sales fell due to a milder winter and storm-related expenses rose.

For the quarter that ended March 31, Ameren reported net income of $71 million, or 29 cents a share, compared with net income of $102 million, or 43 cents a share, in the first quarter of 2010.

Excluding one-time items, the St. Louis company said it earned $60 million, or 25 cents a share, in the first quarter.

Revenue fell 1.9 percent to $1.9 billion.

Analysts expected earnings of 39 cents a share on revenue of $1.96 billion, according to FactSet.

Ameren said kilowatt-hour sales to residential and commercial customers declined 4 percent because of milder weather. The decline was partially offset by a 7 percent increase in kilowatt-hour sales to industrial customers.

The St. Louis company also recorded reduced margins in the merchant generation segment, higher expenses related to storms and lower interest expenses.

For the year, Ameren reaffirmed its forecast of earnings ranging between $2.20 per share and $2.60 per share. Analysts expect earnings of $2.35 a share.

Ameren operates subsidiaries in Missouri and Illinois, serving 2.4 million electric customers and nearly 1 million natural gas customers. Its share price fell 33 cents to close at $28.88.
