OCEANSIDE, Calif. (KGTV) -- A man suspected of causing a disturbance in an Oceanside neighborhood died after being stunned by a police officer’s stun gun during an altercation on the MiraCosta College campus early Wednesday morning.

At around 3:45 a.m., witnesses on Strawberry Place reported someone destroying property and throwing rocks in the neighborhood. Oceanside police said they received reports of a man throwing rocks at homes and vehicles, and breaking windows.

According to police, the same man entered one home and struck an occupant on the shoulder with a metal object before fleeing.

When officers arrived in the neighborhood, the man ran away towards the MiraCosta College campus on 1 Barnard Dr.

Police stated in a release: “When contacted the suspect refused to comply with the officers and attempted to attack them with a metal object that was later determined to be a windshield wiper arm and blade broken off a vandalized vehicle from the neighborhood. A taser was deployed and the suspect was taken into custody.”

Paramedics were summoned to the scene after it was determined the man was not breathing. The man, who was not identified but described as white in his late 40s, died at the scene, police confirmed.
