State Police said they were forced to kill a suspected robber during a standoff at a Dollar General in Harlan County Friday.

Troopers said Neil Saylor entered the Coldiron community store with a gun and demanded money.

When officers arrived, they told Saylor to drop his weapon, but he reportedly refused.

Troopers said the standoff lasted for several hours before Saylor started becoming aggressive towards them.

Thatâ€™s when they said they opened fire.

Saylor was pronounced dead at the scene.
