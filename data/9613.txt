Two SWAT team members involved in a fatal shooting in Berthoud were identified today by the Larimer County Sheriff’s Office.

Benjamin Haskew was fatally shot early Tuesday when he came out of a home armed with a gun and opened fire on SWAT members, authorities said.

The officers who shot Haskew were identified as Deputy Ryan Myatt and Sgt. Brad Harkin.

Myatt was hired by the sheriff’s office in February of 2003 and became a SWAT member in 2007.

Harkin joined the sheriff’s office in 2002 and was promoted to patrol sergeant last year. He’s been a SWAT member since 2005.

The SWAT team was called late Monday night to the 700 block of Bruce Drive to aid Berthoud police on a “domestic violence call involving a man with a gun,” the Larimer County District Attorney’s Office said.

SWAT team members were in “verbal contact” with Haskew when he came out of the home and “opened fire on the SWAT officers,” the DA’s office said, and officers returned the fire.

Haskew, 36, died of “multiple gunshot wounds,” the Larimer County Coroner’s Office said.

The incident is being investigated by the Berthoud police, the sheriff’s office, Colorado State University Police Department (which is part of the SWAT team), and the district attorney’s office.
