ST. LOUIS â€¢ The motorcyclist who was killed in a collision with an off-duty police officer has been identified as Nicklaus Macke.

Macke, 25, lived in the 2000 block of Washington Avenue.

Macke was on a 2008 Honda CBR motorcycle at about 4 p.m. Tuesday, heading east on Olive Street from North Compton. He was approaching the intersection of North Cardinal Avenue when the off-duty officer attempted to turn westbound on Olive from Cardinal.

The motorcycle collided with the left side of the officer's car, a 2003 Cadillac CTS, police said.

The off-duty officer remained at the scene of the crash and was cooperating with investigators, police said Tuesday. He was identified the next day as a 24-year-old off-duty St. Louis police officer. Police have not released the officer's name. He was not injured.

An investigation is ongoing and will not be complete until a toxicology report is completed, police said. The report can take up to 16 weeks to complete.
