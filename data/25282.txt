A man accused of attacking a security guard with a machete died early Wednesday after an officer tased him in southeast Dallas.

The guard called police to report the assault at the Creekside Villas Apartments in the 300 block of north Jim Miller Road around 2:45 a.m., Dallas police spokesman Mitchell Warren said.
