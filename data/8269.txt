A 23-year-old man was pronounced dead today after being shot by Chicago police after he reportedly refused to drop his gun in Marquette Park.



Deangelo Webb of the 3600 block of West 70th Street was pronounced dead at 8:19 a.m. at Advocate Christ Medical Center, said a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office.



A Chicago police officer shot Webb in the chest after he refused to drop his gun this morning at about 5:30 a.m. in an alley on the 2800 block of West 64th Street.

Chicago Police News Affairs officer Robert Perez said two officers from the Chicago Lawn district were responding to a report about a man with a gun. Perez said the officers encountered a man with a handgun and ordered him to drop his weapon.



"When he didn't, the officers, for the safety of themselves and others in the area, shot the individual," Perez said. "it's still preliminary, but we believe only one officer did the shooting. We did recover a weapon at the scene," he said.



The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting, said Mark Payne a spokesman for the authority
