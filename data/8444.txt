CLEVELAND, Ohio-- The family of a Brook Park man, who died Sept. 19 when his car crashed into a utility pole while being pursued by police, has filed a lawsuit against Linndale and Brooklyn police.

The family of Yuceff Young II is seeking an unspecified amount of damages maintaining that Young would not have died if he had not been Tasered by a Linndale police officer and chased by police from Linndale and Brooklyn.

Police stopped the car of the 21-year-old man on Memphis Avenue near the Brooklyn border because his car appeared to be unsafe, Linndale police said at the time.

Police said Young's front bumper was hanging off and the windshield was shattered.

The police officer smelled alcohol and ordered Young to get out of the car. He did not.

Police said that's when the officer Tasered Young, but just as he fired, the car speeded away.

Police said before the Linndale officer had a chance to report the fleeing vehicle, Young's car was spotted by a Brooklyn police officer, who gave chase. The Linndale officer followed.

Young's car went a short distance and turned onto Tiedeman Road, where it crashed into a utility pole.

"We believe the actions of the police were reckless," said Terry Gilbert, attorney for the family. "He was a good kid, a college student, and he was drunk. We don't know why, or if, his car was banged up. But we know he was not giving the officer a hard time. But he was Tasered while sitting behind the wheel, which is very dangerous."

Police today said they have not seen a copy of the lawsuit, which was filed April 23 in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court, and declined to comment on it.
