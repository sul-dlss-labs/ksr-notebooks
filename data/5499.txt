UPDATE: Norman Barnette, the 53 year old father of two was the person killed by three people who police said tried to break into an ATM on Sharon Amity Road last week. See article.

Three men were trying to escape police and caused a crash that killed an innocent driver today. According to authorities, the three men were trying to break into a Cashpoints automated teller machine (ATM) in the Kimmerly Glen Shopping Center on North Sharon Amity Road around 2 pm. They put a towel over the ATM camera and a woman who witnessed this, called 911.

When a Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer arrived at the scene, the men tried to flee, police said. The suspects drove their yellow Dodge Caravan on the grass and out of the parking lot. They failed to yield to any traffic on Sharon Amity Rd. The van struck a white Chevy truck, causing it to flip and the driver of the truck was killed in the crash.

Another van was also hit during the wreck. That vehicleâ€™s driver was transported to the hospital with minor injuries. Police said officers were not in pursuit when the crash occurred, but after the impact the suspects jumped out of their van and ran. Police chased them down with the help of K-9 dogs. Two of the men are in custody. A third man is still on the loose. Investigators are still trying to determine if the suspects were actually trying to break into the ATM or fraudulently use an ATM card. Sources: WSOC-TV, WCNC, News 14 Carolina
