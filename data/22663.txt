A Bedford man who crashed his motorcycle earlier this month during a pursuit with a Bedford County deputy has died, an official said.

Stacy Adam Panter, 34, died Monday.

Maj. Ricky Gardner of the Bedford County Sheriff's Office, said he did not know what caused Panter's death, or if the cause of death was related to injuries Panter suffered during the crash.

Panter's family could not be reached.

Panter was riding his motorcycle north on Virginia 122 near Gills Road on June 8 when he illegally passed an unmarked police car at a high rate of speed, according to a press release from the sheriff's office.

The deputy initiated a traffic stop, and Panter sped up, the sheriff's office said.

Panter then lost control of the motorcycle and crashed near Angus Road, the sheriff's office said.

He was airlifted to Carilion Roanoke Memorial Hospital.
