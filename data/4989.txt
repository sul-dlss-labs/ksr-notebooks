A man fleeing sheriff's deputies sank waist-deep into a mud hole and died, apparently of exhaustion and cold, as the authorities tried to pull him out, officials said. The chase began when deputies stopped a vehicle driven by the man, Shawn E. Leflore, 33, for having an outdated registration sticker. When deputies discovered that Mr. Leflore had given them false information, he ran into a field, a spokesman for the Dallas County Sheriff's Department, Sgt. Don Peritz, said. Deputies searched for about an hour before finding him. They tried for several hours to pull him out.
