Oneida, NY -- A 17-year-old killed by police after a chase through Canastota was identified by state police as Justin Arnold, of 2808 Hill Road, Cazenovia.

Trooper Jack Keller, a public information officer with Troop D, made the identification through email sent at 1:19 p.m.

The Madison County District Attorney's Office, which called the incident "a devastating tragedy," issued a news release this morning saying that they would not discuss the case.

The shooting began at 2:20 p.m. Thursday with a call to 911 reporting a carjacking in Sherrill, state police said Thursday. A chase began in the village of Canastota and ended on a dead-end road in the town of Sullivan. At the end of the chase, troopers said the driver approached two Canastota police officers with a gun drawn and was shot dead by the officers.

Troopers later determined the youth had a realistic pellet gun in his hands when the officers shot him.

The investigation is continuing, Lt.Troy D. Little said. Troopers believe that Arnold made the call himself to 911 to report a carjacking in Sherrill, Little said. Troopers recovered a cell phone from the car Arnold was driving and are making sure that was the phone used to call 911, Little said.

While troopers believe that much was planned, they are unsure how much was planned, such whether he planned to drive down the dead-end John Peet Road in the town of Sullivan.

By Arnold's actions, however, troopers feel that Arnold knew what he was doing when he came at officers with a pellet gun, Little said. "Any person would know the results when you point a handgun at officers," Little said.

The investigation will continue for a few days while troopers track down leads and talk to friends, relatives and coworkers, he said.
