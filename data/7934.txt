Cesar Ramirez, a 25-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by police officers on Wednesday, March 11, in the 2600 block of Menlo Avenue in University Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The incident began when Southwest Area patrol officers stopped a car for possible narcotics violations about 8:30 p.m. in the 1500 block of West Adams Boulevard, according to an LAPD news release.

They saw a pedestrian standing in the street, leaning into the car and talking with the four men inside. Officers directed the pedestrian onto the sidewalk, and Officer Ruben DelCastillo approached the driver.

The driver, later identified as Ramirez, suddenly pointed a handgun at DelCastillo, and DelCastillo shot at him, police said. Ramirez then fled in the car, driving east on Adams Boulevard. The officers pursued the victim and broadcast via police radio a description of the car and the direction it was traveling.

As he attempted to turn right on Menlo Avenue, Ramirez collided with a student shuttle bus. The bus driver and about 10 students were not injured.

Ramirez drove on, traveling south on Menlo Avenue for several hundred feet and colliding with several parked cars and a construction trailer before coming to a stop. He remained in the car while the three other men inside got out and ran.

Officers found Ramirez with a gunshot wound. He was taken to a hospital, where he died.

Two handguns were recovered, and the three men who fled were later found and arrested.
