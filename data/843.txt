Chicago police said Wednesday that two undercover officers acted appropriately when they fatally shot a man who allegedly aimed a gun at them after a North Side chase.

George Montoya, 20, was shot several times Tuesday evening in the back yard of a building in the 6300 block of North Rockwell Street.

Police said a 911 call was placed by someone walking a dog who saw Montoya firing a gun in the 6100 block of North Talman Avenue.

Tactical officers spotted Montoya, and he began to run, police spokesman Pat Camden said. One officer chased Montoya, following him through a gangway and over a fence.

The officer found Montoya kneeling in the yard, pointing a gun at him, Camden said. Montoya allegedly refused to drop his gun and the officer shot him.

The second officer, who circled the area in his car, entered the yard and Montoya aimed the gun at that officer, who shot him, Camden said.
