(Jeanerette-AP) -- The family of a Jeanerette woman killed by a car that was fleeing police has filed a lawsuit against the 19-year-old driver.

Carol Hills Junior, of Natchitoches, was charged with manslaughter in the January death of 23-year-old Angela Bernard. The civil lawsuit, which seeks monetary damages, was filed in state district court on behalf of Bernard's two young sons.

Jeanerette police say Hills struck Bernard and her 14-year-old niece near the city's library after a high-speed chase that began when officers tried to talk to a group of men who appeared to be preparing to fight.

Police Chief Morman Alexander says that when police drove up, Hills jumped into a car and sped away. During a pursuit, his car sideswiped another car and then struck Bernard before crashing into a truck.

The niece, Lissie Bernard, is recovering from injuries. Hills is set for trial on July 26th on the manslaughter charge.
