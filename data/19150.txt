LEXINGTON — A Rockbridge County grand jury will consider a murder charge against a man who police said led them on a high-speed chase that ended with another driver’s death.

Charges of second-degree murder and eluding police were certified to the grand jury after a preliminary hearing Wednesday for Tyquanne Corelle McCargo.

McCargo, 24, of Charlotte, North Carolina, was arrested after a Dec. 10 wreck that killed Ricky Stuart Deacon of Fairfield.

Police have said they tried to pull McCargo over on Interstate 81 after his Nissan Pathfinder was clocked going 93 mph in a zone marked for 70 mph, according to court documents.

After first stopping for a state trooper, the driver sped away — leading police on a chase that ended off Exit 200, when his SUV crossed a centerline on Virginia 710 and struck a Dodge Ram driven by Deacon.

Deacon, 55, was pronounced dead at the scene.
