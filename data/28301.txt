A woman armed with a gun was shot and killed by Orange County Sheriff’s Department deputies as they responded to what turned out to be a false burglary report at a Lake Forest home, according to authorities.

Deputies responded to a reported burglary in progress at a home in the 22000 block of Loumont Drive, near the intersection of Muirlands Boulevard and Ridge Route Drive, at about 1 a.m. They found a woman, believed to be in her 20s, holding a gun across the street from the home where the call originated, according to Carrie Braun of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.

Commands from deputies to the woman to drop the gun were ignored by the suspect and deputies shot the woman, Braun said.

The woman died at a hospital.

A gun was recovered at the scene, Braun said. The department released a photo of a handgun on the ground at the scene.

No injuries were reported to deputies or the homeowner, she said.

Deputies later spoke with the homeowners, who said they did not call for help. Deputies determined that the call might have come from a cell phone in possession of the woman who was killed.

There was no evidence of a burglary.

"It’s unclear at this time why the woman falsely reported the crime in progress, and the investigation is ongoing," the sheriff's department said in a statement.
