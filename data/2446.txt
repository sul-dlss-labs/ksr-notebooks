Union leaders told have told striking Hollywood writers that they plan to meet with representatives for studios to discuss restarting negotiations. The Writers Guild of America told its members in an email Tuesday night that a representative from the employers' side requested a meeting on Friday to discuss starting talks again. It's the first official communication between the two sides since the strike began three months ago. It wasn't immediately known whether a similar overture was made to union leaders for Hollywood actors, who have been on strike since July 14. A representative for the studios alliance said only that they remain committed to finding a solution for both strikes.
