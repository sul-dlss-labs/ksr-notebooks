(Mansfield-AP) -- Authorities say a man who allegedly raped a 15-year-old girl drowned after jumping off a bridge in Logansport into the Sabine River.

The body of 42-year-old Ralph Allen, of Mansfield, was found yesterday about five hours after he dove off the two-lane bridge connecting Louisiana and Texas. Allen, a convicted felon whose parole ended this month, jumped as a sheriff's deputy pulled up behind Allen's vehicle, which was blocking one lane of traffic on the bridge. At the time, deputies were unaware that Allen had just released the rape victim at the edge of the bridge.

The attack took place in Mansfield. Police say the victim was the daughter of a woman who Jackson had been living with since his release from prison in 2002. He had served 12 years for armed robbery and second-degree murder. His parole ended May eleventh.
