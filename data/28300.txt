A woman shot by a Gastonia Police officer on Monday morning remains listed in critical condition, although family members say she has passed away and they have signed papers to donate her organs.

An officer responding to an overdose call at 12:12 a.m. Monday at 1215 Mountain Ave. reportedly encountered 33-year-old Shae Estelle Jones with a gun, according to Gastonia Police reports.

The officer shot Jones, who was first taken to CaroMont Regional Medical Center and then airlifted to Atrium Health's Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. Jones had been listed in critical, but stable condition Monday, but her condition worsened overnight.

"The Lord took my sister at 3:07 today. Her organs will be going help other people in need. Thanks for all the calls and prayers!," her sister, Ashley Jones Matheson, posted on social media. Matheson also messaged The Gazette and said her sister had died.

Gastonia Police Chief Travis Brittain has asked the State Bureau of Investigation to investigate the shooting, a standard practice in an officer-involved shooting.

Jones was undergoing treatment for a debilitating sequence of seizures that had impacted her mental health in the days leading to the shooting, Matheson said Monday.

"She was released from the hospital yesterday," Matheson said Monday. "She'd had three really bad seizures and they'd changed all her medications."

Police have identified Officer Kevin Solano-Garita, 24, as the officer who shot Jones. The department has placed him on paid administrative leave while the shooting remains under investigation, also a standard procedure in such cases. Solano-Garita started working for Gastonia Police on Feb. 24, 2020.

The Gastonia Police Departmentâ€™s Office of Professional Standards will conduct a separate but parallel administrative investigation to determine whether department policies and procedures were followed, according to police.
