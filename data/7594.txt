SANFORD, N.C. â€” State officials on Friday released the names of a Sanford police officer and a man killed in a shooting late Thursday afternoon.







Sgt. Marshall Cox shot and killed Alexis Lee McCathan during a scuffle on Weatherspoon Street, near a Kangaroo convenience store, said Noelle Talley, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Justice.







Cox responded to 911 calls saying that McCathan had caused a disturbance and started an altercation inside the store, Sanford police said. Cox encountered McCathan about 50 yards down the road from the store.







Police said that McCathan scuffled with Cox and assaulted him with a stick. In response, officers said, Cox drew his weapon and shot McCathan, who died.







Cox was treated at a local medical center.







Capt. David Smith, with the Sanford police, said that a preliminary investigation showed that Cox's use of force was justified.







Cox has been placed on desk duty while the State Bureau of Investigation reviews the incident, which is standard procedure in all officer-involved shootings.
