An autopsy on a suspect who got into a shootout with police in the Buford area last month shot and killed himself, according to information released Monday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.

A GBI press statement said autopsy results indicated John James Monahan, Jr., 26, of Ellabell, committed suicide during the altercation.

The incident occurred on Friday, Feb. 21, as officers with the Gwinnett County Police Department pursued a stolen vehicle being driven by Monahan; the vehicle had just been involved in a traffic accident at Peachtree Industrial Boulevard and Shadburn Ferry Road in the Buford area. Police believed Monahan was armed with an AK-style rifle as he left the scene of the crash, stealing a vehicle in the process.

Officers pursued Monahan into Shoal Creek Park in Buford, which is located in Hall County.

At that point, the suspect drove through the park and into Lake Lanier. Officers said he began firing at police from the sinking vehicle. A police vehicle was hit by gunfire, but no officers were injured. Police returned fire.

The GBI report indicated Monahan died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The GBI said agents will continue an independent investigation of the officer-involved shooting and homicide. Once the investigation is complete, the information will be turned over to the Hall County District Attorneyâ€™s Office.
