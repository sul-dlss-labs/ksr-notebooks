The man fatally shot by Omaha police Sunday was a graduate of Thomas Jefferson High School and had family ties in Council Bluffs.

Led by a phone tip, officers found Brian R. Swotek at 2462 S. 18 St. in Omaha Sunday evening. The owner of the house gave officers permission to enter the building to arrest Swotek, said Officer Cathy Martinec, a public information spokeswoman.

He was wanted by the FBI for conspiracy to deliver narcotics, Martinec said.

"Probably from Iowa over to Nebraska," she added.

Swotek pointed a 9mm handgun at himself as officers, including undercover Officer Scott Beran, found him in a small bedroom in the house.

Beran, an officer for 6 1/2 years, attempted to persuade Swotek to drop his weapon, Martinec said.

"Swotek stated he would not go back to prison and would kill himself first," Martinec said.

During the incident, Swotek turned his gun toward the officers. Beran then shot Swotek.

"Beran fired his weapon in defense of his life," Martinec said.

Swotek was taken to Nebraska Medical Center where he died.

About a year before he was shot, Swotek, 30, of Omaha lived in Council Bluffs, where members of his family live. They declined to comment.

During the time he lived in Council Bluffs, Swotek was arrested April 17, 2002, on warrants for driving without a license, reckless driving, failure to appear in court for child support payments, eluding and three counts of disobedience to a traffic sign, according to Nonpareil reports.

In Omaha, Swotek had mostly avoided trouble with the law.

"He didn't have much of a record here," said Martinec.

The Omaha Police will conduct an internal investigation, and the case will go to a grand jury, Martinec said.
