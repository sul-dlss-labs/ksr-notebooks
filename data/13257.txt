The Coroner’s Office has identified the parolee who apparently shot himself in a Winnetka apartment following a pursuit and standoff Thursday night as Joshua Parker Reed, 32, of Van Nuys, according to Coroner’s office spokesman Ed Winters.

Reed was wanted on an alleged weapons violation, but when police attempted to contact him near Burbank and Van Nuys boulevards in Van Nuys just after 7 p.m. Thursday night, he jumped on a motorcycle and sped off, officers said.

He was followed overhead by a helicopter during the 25-minute chase through the San Fernando Valley, before leading police to an apartment complex at Mason Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard, where he abandoned the motorcycle and fled into an apartment.

Police evacuated the building, and prepared to send in the Metropolitan Division K-9 unit around 10 p.m., after failing to convince Reed to leave the apartment. As they were about to enter, police heard a gunshot from inside the apartment.

“As they made entry they heard a gunshot in the back room,” said Capt. Joel Justice of the the Los Angeles Police Department Topanga Division. “As they made entry into the back room — it ended up being a bathroom — the suspect had suffered from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and did not survive.”

He was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics.

LAPD did not immediately have any additional details about the incident or Reed.
