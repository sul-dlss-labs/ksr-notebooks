Deputies responded to a 19-year-old man who fired a shotgun at them in Gavilan Hills by shooting back dozens of times over a 33-second period killing him, according to a video taken by a witness.

Rustin Wilkerson was declared dead on the porch of a house Saturday, June 8, in the 21600 block of Oak Street in Gavilan Hills, west of Perris and southeast of Lake Mathews, according to sheriff’s Deputy Albert Martinez.

Deputies saw Wilkerson inside the house with a gun before he raised the weapon, triggering the gunfight at 4:35 a.m., Martinez said.

Before the first shot was fired, several female voices can be heard screaming, one of them yelling, “Rustin, stop,” according to the video, provided to the The Press-Enterprise by a witness who asked not be identified.

Less than a second later, the barrage of gunfire began. Voices can be heard screaming throughout with a man’s voice shouting “move” loudly in a momentary break in shooting.

After the final shot, what sounds like a woman’s voice can be heard wailing, “You shot my baby … oh my God, you shot my baby.”

The Sheriff’s Department declined to say exactly how many shots were fired, how many times the suspect was hit, or whether anybody else was present in the home during the shooting.

“Four officers were being fired upon during the incident by the suspect and the officers returned fire in defense of their lives,” Martinez said.

On Tuesday, June 11, the front of the single-story home was peppered with bullet holes, particularly around two windows that overlooked the street.
