A driver fleeing police died early Friday morning when his vehicle crashed into the side of a church.

Washington State Patrol identified the driver as Hugh Melvin Washington, 44. A statement from the Bremerton Police Department said the driver was suspected of being drunk.

A Bremerton police officer saw the 2002 white Volvo S80 driving erratically at about 2 a.m. and began to pull him over.

“And then the vehicle just took off,” said Trooper Russ Winger.

The driver was turning onto Halverson Avenue from Sylvan Way, and fled south on Halverson, speeding through the intersection at Sheridan Way and hitting Iglesia Ni Cristo Church.

State Patrol troopers are investigating at the request of Bremerton police.
