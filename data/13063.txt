Baylous said the two wounded county sheriff's department officers, Deputy Hansford "Buddy" Stapleton of Summersville and Sgt. Richard T. Allison of Richwood, were expected to survive, the Charleston newspaper said.

Baylous said the incident began shortly after 9 a.m. EDT when the officers were dispatched to check out a dispute between neighbors. One of them was wounded by a shotgun blast fired by Evans after stepping onto the porch of his home. The second officer was shot after backup arrived.

With officers from six agencies positioned around the house, Evans periodically fired shots our doors and windows until he ultimately was fatally wounded by return fire, the newspaper said.
