â€” The Pulaski County prosecuting attorney's office has cleared police in Little Rock and North Little Rock in two separate shooting deaths.

In recent letters to the police departments, the prosecuting attorney's office wrote that after reviewing the Feb. 24 death of Nathan Rideout in North Little Rock and the Dec. 6 death of DeAndre Glenn in Little Rock, officers won't face charges.

After each of the killings, the officers who fired at Rideout and Glenn were suspended with pay, which is standard procedure, and each department conducted an investigation. The investigative files were turned over to the prosecuting attorney's office, which examined whether the officers had acted criminally in the shootings.
