A knife-wielding man was shot and killed by police after lunging at cops responding to a domestic violence call in New Jersey early Friday, authorities say.

The suspect, identified as 60-year-old Leroy Frank, stabbed his estranged wife multiple times in a home on Greenbrook Drive in Bloomfield, prosecutors said. Cops responded to the scene after getting a call shortly before 8 a.m.

When police arrived, they found Leroy still holding the knife, investigators said. The officers tried to disarm him, but he lunged at them, at which point one of the cops fired his service weapon two times, according to officials.

It wasn't clear where Leroy was hit. Investigators had initially said he was taken to a hospital in critical condition, but prosecutors later said he was pronounced dead at the scene.

The stabbed woman, who is 54 but has not been identified, was hospitalized in stable condition. The officer who shot Leroy was taken to a hospital for evaluation after complaining of chest pains.

It wasn't immediately clear if any prior domestic violence calls had been made from the home. The area was cordoned off as authorities investigated.

Neighbor Greg Silverstein was stunned to learn Frank pulled a knife on his estranged wife; he called the couple next door his favorite neighbors.

"He just seemed like a decent guy, it's really shocking," he said.
