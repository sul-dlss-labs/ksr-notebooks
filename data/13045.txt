A Tarrant County grand jury declined to indict an Arlington Police officer Friday in a fatal shooting of a gunman, which took place outside of a nightclub on July 4, 2013.

According to a press release from the Tarrant County District Attorney's office, the police officer was flagged down by a security guard at Saigon Nights just after 1 a.m. where a fight had broken out and continued into the parking lot.

After exiting his patrol car, the officer encountered a gunman, Alex Quoc Nguyen, running through the parking lot, shooting at patrons.

Nguyen confronted the officer, who returned fire, striking the suspect and killing him. Nguyen was pronounced dead on location.
