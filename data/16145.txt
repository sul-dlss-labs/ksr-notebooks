HACKENSACK -- A 24-year-old man shot by police Thursday afternoon in the city has died, according to authorities.

Three city police officers went to 10 Temple Avenue around 1:30 p.m. to check on Elvin Diaz at the request of county probation officials, Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli said in a Twitter message.

Hackensack Police Director Michael Mordaga said Diaz was armed with "a very large knife" when the shooting occurred. In a tweet later Thursday, Molinelli said a meat cleaver had been found at the scene but an investigation remained under way.

UPDATE:

Police 'devastated' following shooting, director says

Authorities did not immediately say what sparked the shooting. Diaz later died at Hackensack University Medical Center.

Two police officers involved in the shooting were being treated at the hospital, but Molinelli said they were not believed to be injured.

Bergen County Sheriff's Office records show Diaz has a history of arrests on charges, including resisting arrest and drug possession. It was not immediately clear why officials went to his house.

Nadine Karcs, co-owner of Fu King Smoke Shop said she saw a man covered in blood removed from the house while a woman screamed, "My son, my son!"
