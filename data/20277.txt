A Clark County Jail inmate died after being shot by a corrections deputy Thursday morning at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center, according to the Clark County Sheriff’s Office.

The shooting was reported at 10:41 a.m. when at least one of two corrections deputies guarding the inmate fired their weapon and injured the inmate, who was in the hospital receiving care, sheriff’s office spokesman Fred Neiman said.

The situation, which took place in a patient room on the fifth floor of the Firstenburg Tower, was quickly brought under control. Within the hour, the hospital returned to normal operations, PeaceHealth spokesman Randy Querin said.

The inmate, who was not identified but was described as a 66-year-old man, was brought into the hospital to receive treatment Wednesday morning and stayed overnight under guard, according to the sheriff’s office.

Neiman said he was being held on a warrant from the U.S. Marshals Service for violating his parole by escaping from community custody and for unlawful possession of a firearm.
