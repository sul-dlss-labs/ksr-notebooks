Montgomery Police have now identified the man police shot and killed Friday night.

There are new details emerging about the shooting and high speed chase that led up to the incident. No one seems to know much about the man police shot Friday night, but police have released a tentative identification. Police say he is 25-year-old Jose Laniez-Ortiz.

Montgomery Police say he shot another Hispanic man, Armando Barrientos, while they played a video game in this apartment complex. A spokesman says Laniez-Ortiz led officers down the Atlanta Highway to Perry Hill Road where he apparently threatened officers.

Lt. Huey Thornton of MPD says, "As the officers approached the vehicle, as I stated in the release, circumstances developed that resulted in a fatal shooting."

Police will not say just how many shots officers fired at Laniez-Ortiz, but WSFA 12 News counted at least a dozen to fifteen evidence markers, which are often used to show shell casings on the scene Friday night.

Police say he may have also entered the United States illegally.
