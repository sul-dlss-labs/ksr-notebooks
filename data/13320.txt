Police found Germaine driving the vehicle and attempted to pull the car over but he sped away, sparking a pursuit, police said.

During the chase, Germaine hit a police patrol car and a civilian vehicle, Orman said.

He later lost control of the Mercedes, which ended up in the dirt near the intersection of Hillcrest Avenue and Wildflower Drive, next to the Crossings Shopping Center, according to police.

Police said Germaine ran from the car carrying a handgun, and officers chased him. At least one officer opened fire when Germaine allegedly pointed a gun at the officers, according to police.

Germaine was shot several times and was pronounced dead at the scene, police said. No officers were injured.

Police did not say how many officers were involved in the shooting, which was being investigated by Antioch police, the Contra Costa County District Attorney's Office and the Contra Costa County Forensics and Crime Lab.
