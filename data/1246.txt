A city police sergeant who was shot yesterday afternoon during a traffic stop on a Queens street corner returned fire, killing a suspect, the police said.

The sergeant, John Asam, 37, who was hit once in the chest, was listed in stable condition at New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens, the police said.

The police identified the dead suspect as Richard Hatcher, 19, of West Babylon, N.Y.

Sergeant Asam, who had been wearing plain clothes, was apparently saved because he was wearing a bulletproof vest, the police said.

''Sergeant Asam was shot, and because he had a vest on, he will make a full and complete recovery,'' Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday at news conference as he held up the vest.
