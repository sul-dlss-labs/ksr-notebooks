Responding to Ms. Erdmannâ€™s call, police officers from Bechtelsville, Douglass Township, other communities and the county, swarmed with helicopters and ambulances to the site of the shootings, about 100 miles southwest of New York City.

Joseph Shay and the little boy were already dead in blood-spattered scenes in the house. Monica Shay was in very critical condition and Paul Shay and Ms. Erdmann were reported as critically wounded, although both were said to be conscious when the police arrived and able to speak to investigators later.

As the victims were airlifted to nearby Pottstown Memorial Medical Center and Lehigh Valley Hospital, the authorities, who apparently learned the identity of the gunman from Paul Shay, began an extensive manhunt for Mr. Geisenheyner, first in the pastures and woods of Montgomery County, and then in a wider area of Eastern Pennsylvania.

Meantime, the assailant had fled south about 40 miles to Trainer, Pa., a small Delaware County community just south of Philadelphia, and sought refuge Sunday night at the home of a friend he had known at a halfway house in Chester, Pa., about 10 years ago.

Mr. Geisenheyner, whose criminal record dated back to the 1970s, had been jailed repeatedly. Since his release about a year ago, officials said, he had lived in various places and had repeatedly vowed revenge against Paul Shay. On Sunday, he told his friend that he had finally taken it. He also mentioned details of the Bechtelsville slayings that had not been made public, officials said.
