The Denver coroner’s office has released the name of a 28-year-old man who died of multiple gunshot wounds late Sunday night after a gun battle with police.

Two SWAT officers fatally shot Miguel Angel Martinez as they entered the small home where he was staying behind his grandfather’s house.

Police were called to 305 S. Alcott St. at 5:30 p.m. Sunday on a report of a disturbance. Gunshots had been fired and Martinez had wounded himself with one of the shots, police have said.

The two SWAT officers who were involved in the gun battle have been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation. Police involved in shootings are routinely placed on leave.

Martinez had fled from community corrections a few months before the shooting, where he was serving a drug conviction, said Adrienne Jacobson, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Corrections.

He was a wanted fugitive at the time of the shooting on Sunday, according to Jacobson.

He has a criminal record that is 14 pages long and includes many convictions for confrontations with police, assaults, robbery and domestic violence.
