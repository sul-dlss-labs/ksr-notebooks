PHILADELPHIA -- Police shot and killed a 16-year-old Saturday who authorities said was armed with a sawed-off shotgun. It was the city's third fatal police shooting in three weeks.

Two officers responding to a report of a possible armed robbery tried to question Tyronn Sparks and another man, police said. When an officer chased Sparks up an alley, Sparks turned and pointed a shotgun at the officer and the officer shot him, police said.

Sparks died at a hospital at 1:30 a.m. from at least one gunshot wound to the buttocks. Authorities did not provide more information.

Police said they had determined that he and the other man were not involved in the robbery that the officers were investigating.

Capt. Benjamin Naish, a police spokesman, said the officer was placed on administrative duty, a standard measure during an investigation of an officer-involved shooting.

The shooting came six days after police shot and killed a man after they said an electric stun-gun failed to subdue him.

On New Year's Day, police shot and killed an unarmed 20-year-old man as he ran from the scene of gunfire. Police said he had been among a group of men firing guns at officers.
