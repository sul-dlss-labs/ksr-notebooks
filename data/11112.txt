Kenneth Gomez, a 27-year-old Latino, died Wednesday, March 7, two days after he was shot by police near Arden Drive and Freer Street in Temple City, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The shooting occurred late Monday night when police pursued Gomez, who they said had been seen "tampering" with and "unloading" a U-Haul truck in El Monte. The pursuit continued until Gomez was trapped by authorities on a cul-de-sac.

After letting passenger Dennis Day, 20, out of the truck, Gomez drove at "a high rate of speed" at the officer who had initiated the pursuit.

"He came close to striking the initial pursuing officer," Lt. Eddie Hernandez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's homicide bureau said. "That caused officers to fire rounds, fearing for their safety."

Hernandez said that three officers fired at Gomez. Upon being hit, the suspect crashed into a residence. He was transported to the hospital, where he remained in critical condition until Wednesday.

No else was injured in the incident.

Anyone with additional details about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
