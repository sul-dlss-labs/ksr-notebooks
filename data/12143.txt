KENTFIELD (CBS SF) - The body of a Novato man who jumped into the Corte Madera Creek to evade police last month was recovered from the creek behind Adaline E. Kent Middle School in Kentfield on Monday, a Marin County sheriff's lieutenant said.

A citizen informed Fairfax police Monday evening that there appeared to be a body floating in the creek behind the school at 800 College Ave., sheriff's Lt. Jamie Scardina said Tuesday morning.

Fairfax police then called the sheriff's office around 5:45 p.m., and the sheriff's dive team responded, Scardina said.

The Marin County coroner's office identified the body as that of 23-year-old Anthony Donelson, of Novato, Scardina said.

The death remains under investigation, he said.

Ross police stopped Donelson's car in the area of Sir Francis Drake Boulevard and College Avenue, near the College of Marin, around 12:30 a.m. on Dec. 24.

Donelson fled toward the creek when officers asked him to get out of the car. He ran under the roadway, climbed over a fence and jumped into the creek, according to police.

Officers followed Donelson and encouraged him to grab onto metal bars on the side of a culvert, but Donelson swam away from them, Ross Police Chief Erik Masterson said.

Police lost sight of Donelson when he disappeared under the water. They searched for him until 4:45 a.m., and the Marin County sheriff's search-and-rescue team resumed the search downstream four hours later.

Police from Twin Cities, Fairfax, Ross, and the College of Marin, and firefighters from Southern Marin, Kentfield, Ross Valley and Marin County also searched for Donelson.
