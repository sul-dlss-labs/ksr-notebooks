The Oklahoma Highway Patrol is investigating a trooper-involved shooting that left one man dead in Garvin County.



The Garvin County Sheriff's Office called in troopers to check on a vehicle. Trooper Danny Long found a pickup truck sitting in the middle of a county road.

As Long drove slowly by the vehicle, he saw a man in the driver's seat with a shotgun.

The driver, later identified as 41-year-old Ray Kent Puckett, took off when he saw Long. Long chased him and performed a maneuver that forced Puckett to pull over.

According to an OHP spokesperson, Puckett got out of the truck and pointed a shotgun at Long. Long pulled his own weapon and shot Puckett. Puckett was killed.

Long has been with the Oklahoma Highway Patrol for 12 years. He is now placed on routine administrative leave, according to officials.
