A Chicago police officer shot and killed a 16-year-old boy in the Lawndale neighborhood Thursday night after a the teen aimed a gun at officers, according to police.

But an autopsy Friday revealed the teen, Rakeem Nance, suffered a gunshot wound to the back and his death was ruled a homicide, the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said.

The shooting happened about 9:15 p.m. in the 1900 block of South Spaulding Avenue after Nance and two other men committed a home invasion, a Police Department statement said.

Officers saw the three men running across a vacant lot, carrying stolen goods, while they were patrolling the area. Police said one of them was wearing a mask and holding a gun.

Two of the men got away after a foot chase but police caught up with Nance, who was ordered several times to drop his weapon, according to the statement. Police said they shot Nance after he pointed his gun at an officer. A weapon was recovered at the scene, according to police.

According to Police Supt. Jody Weis, Nance aimed his gun at an officer in front of him who was trying to prevent Nance from escaping. An officer behind Nance saw this and shot Nance.

“He pointed his weapon and tried to kill the officer in front of him,” said Weis, who didn’t know if Nance fired the gun. “The officer in the rear probably saved the life of the officer in front of the offender trying to block his getaway.”

Weis said the shooting was still being investigated, but based on the facts he knew, “it appears right now that the shooting was in department guidelines.”

Nance was taken to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Nance was enrolled in 9th grade last school year at Collins Academy High School, 1313 S. Sacramento Dr., according to Chicago Public Schools spokeswoman Monique Bond.

Police said no officers were hurt in the incident. The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting.
