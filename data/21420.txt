A call about a family disturbance Saturday evening, July 15, ended in an officer-involved shooting at a Moreno Valley apartment complex, sheriff’s officials say.

The family disturbance was reported at 6:30 p.m. at the Stonegate at Towngate apartment complex, 12600 block of Memorial Way, adjacent to the Moreno Valley Mall, said Riverside County sheriff’s Sgt. Chris Willison.

Brenda Walker, 61, who identified herself as the shooting victim’s grandmother, says her grandson, 23, was flashing a gun and someone called police.

Willison said deputies arrived and an officer-involved shooting took place. He would not comment further.

Walker said her grandson was shot multiple times in the chest.

Sarah Bader, a resident of the complex, said she heard a series of three shots about 6:30 p.m. and then a second series of three shots.

Walker says her grandson was taken to Riverside University Medical Center in Moreno Valley, where doctors told her Saturday night that they wouldn’t know his condition for hours.

Aside from the mall, the apartment complex is sandwiched between a number of retail shops, including Costco to the west and Ross to the east.

Residents who were out when the shooting happened weren’t being allowed back into their apartments Saturday evening.

Walker said she, too, was being kept out of the complex — and couldn’t comfort her daughter.

She said her grandson, who lives in Los Angeles and was visiting his mom, wasn’t perfect.

“Our baby doll … he had some problems,” she said, “but he was a good kid.”
