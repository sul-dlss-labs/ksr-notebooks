The father of a man killed by Jefferson County Sheriff's Office deputies following a high-speed car chase has filed a wrongful death suit against the department and an assisting municipal police officer.

On March 19, 2005, Gary Bird, 32, of House Springs, was shot four times after an altercation with county deputies and a Pevely police officer.

The altercation began after police say Bird led officers on two high-speed pursuits on the same day near Highway MM.

According to police and former Jefferson County Prosecutor Bob Wilkins, Bird, after being blocked by county officers during the chase, steered his vehicle toward police, forcing one officer to dive into a car to avoid being struck.

Police then fired 10 rounds into Bird's vehicle, four of which hit Bird.

Bird was transported to a local hospital following the shooting where he died two days later.

Toxicology results indicated the presence of cocaine in his bloodstream.

Wilkins cleared all officers of wrongdoing after an investigation into the incident.

The investigation concluded that Bird, who had 13 outstanding traffic warrants at the time of the shooting, had a "penchant" for leading police on car chases.

The lawsuit, filed last week in federal court by Greg Bird, claims his son's death was the result of "negligence and carelessness" by police, and that officers "negligently used deadly force to apprehend (Bird) for a minor traffic violation and expired license plates."

It also claims that police violated state law prohibiting law enforcement officers from using deadly force to arrest suspects who have committed misdemeanor or lesser offenses and that police violated departmental procedures.

The suit seeks damages in excess of $75,000 from six parties named in the action.
