Authorities have released the name of a man who died late Saturday after crashing his motorcycle during a chase by police through Thousand Oaks.

Donald Ray Caldwell, 44, of Moorpark failed to stop for deputies who tried to pull him over for allegedly riding without a helmet and running a red light at Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Hampshire Road about 11:45 p.m., authorities said.

During the brief chase, deputies said, they raced up to 95 mph in pursuit of Caldwell. He failed to negotiate a curve at Hampshire and Lakefield roads and lost control of his motorcycle. He died instantly from head trauma, coroner’s officials said.

Coroner’s officials are running toxicology tests to see if Caldwell was under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the accident, but results won’t be back for several weeks.
