David R. Garvin’s first brush with New York City came at a time when his life was already drenched in personal and professional failure. It ended in May 2005 with a collapsed career in the production department of The Wall Street Journal.

But he came back, months later, this time to make movies.

Traveling in the dim light of obscurity that New York bestows on most of its citizens, he had a sensibility that was unremittingly dark. He gravitated toward the paranormal, to projects where the bizarre and abstruse — in one of his scripts, a metallic object inhabits a philosophy professor — converged into the far-fetched.

Twice divorced at 42, he found refuge in a Bronx apartment with an old friend, an emergency medical technician, a man committed to saving lives. Then a woman drew him to live in Greenwich Village, where he liked to drop into the De Marco’s Pizzeria on West Houston Street to eat bowls of spaghetti.

That was where he went Wednesday night, bent on a bloody errand. He had a beard glued to his face and a bag stuffed with ammunition and two guns, and he fired 15 rounds into the back of a restaurant worker, Alfredo Romero, presumably to avenge a grudge. Pursued by a pair of young auxiliary policemen, he killed them, too, before the police ended his life on Bleecker Street.
