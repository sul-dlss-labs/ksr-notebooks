A 26-year-old Southeast DC man has died after being shot by police Monday afternoon.

The man, identified by police as Robert Brown, had run from police who were in the 4900 block of G Street, Southeast investigating a case. The Washington Post reports that that investigation was into the weekend shooting death of Rokeida Spriggs.

A press release from MPD states that after running from police, Brown was involved in a “physical altercation” with police and he produced a handgun.



Says MPD:

The officer ordered the suspect several times to drop the weapon, but the suspect did not comply.Fearing for his life, the police officer discharged his service weapon and struck the suspect multiple times. DC Fire and Emergency Medical Services personnel responded and transported the suspect to a local hospital where he was later pronounced dead.
