JEFFERSON — A Jefferson man was shot and killed by authorities during an armed confrontation with Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office deputies early Friday morning.

Sheriff’s deputies, responding to a 911 call, entered a Rockland Road residence at 12:25 a.m. Friday after witnessing what they described as an ongoing assault between a man and woman inside, police said in a news release. That led to an armed confrontation between the man and deputies inside the residence just after 1 a.m., police said.

Jacob E. McClure, 41, of Jefferson, was shot and killed, according to a news release from the Lincoln County Sheriff’s Office. No deputies were injured.

Deputy David Bellows fatally wounded McClure, according to Sheriff Todd Brackett.

Sgt. Matthew Day and Deputy Jerold Winslow were with him at the residence.

The Maine Attorney General’s Office, assisted by Maine State Police, is investigating the incident and sent a team of investigators to Jefferson. The release said the attorney general’s office investigates any officer-involved shooting.

Police said no additional information would be available about the incident until after the completion of the investigation.
