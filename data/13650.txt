The family of a 22-year-old who was fatally shot by police late Friday on the East Oak Cliff block where he lived most of his life said they have many questions about what happened.

About 5 p.m. Friday, Salvador Muñoz’s sister made him sandwiches and noodles and they talked. Jeanette Muñoz, 25, said he didn’t seem angry or aggressive, but the conversation wasn’t one they often had.

“He had apologized to me for putting me through whatever he put me through, because me and him, that’s all we have,” she said. They hugged, and that was the last time she saw him.

“I kind of think he felt like something was going to happen.”

Just before midnight, police received a call about a “major disturbance” at a house less than a block away, on East Missouri Avenue near Illinois Avenue and Lancaster Road.

It was not the first time Salvador Muñoz had gone uninvited to his ex-girlfriend’s house. In the past, she called his family to bring him home. This time she called police.

“I want to know why she couldn’t tell us my brother was on her property,” Jeanette Muñoz said. “I don’t know why she had to call the police. What’d he do for her to call the police on him?”

When officers arrived, Muñoz was sitting on the porch. Police said he became “combative and aggressive” when they tried to handcuff him, and a struggle ensued.

Chief David Brown said in a written statement that Muñoz took a Taser from the officers and tried to use it on them.

Police spokeswoman Lt. Midge Boyle said witnesses heard officers telling Muñoz to drop the Taser, but he refused. An officer shot Muñoz, who died at the scene.

Police have not said how many shots were fired or how many officers were present.

The incident remains under investigation, but Jeanette Muñoz said she does not believe the officers’ accounts.

She said someone on the block heard her brother yelling that he didn’t have a weapon and screaming for help.

“Why do you have to shoot him when he’s screaming for help?” she said.

Jeanette Muñoz’s husband, Mario Rivera, said he saw her brother walking down the block about an hour before he was shot. Rivera said he told him to get in the car and they’d go visit Rivera’s grandmother, but Muñoz refused.

Rivera said he knew Muñoz, whom they called “Junior,” had a history of run-ins with the law and had been trying to fit in with a bad crowd, but “he wasn’t like that.”

“He wasn’t a bad guy; he was a real good person, just [made] bad decisions,” Rivera said.

Public records show Muñoz had faced charges of drug possession and delivery, resisting arrest and assault on a public servant.

The name of the officer who fired at Muñoz has not been released, but Brown has put him on administrative leave, which is routine in officer-involved shootings.

The incident is the second such shooting in less than a month. Brown recently fired the officer who shot and wounded a mentally ill man named Bobby Bennett on Oct. 14. A neighbor’s security camera footage showed Bennett had his arms at his sides when the officer shot him.
