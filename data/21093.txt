GENESEE COUNTY Authorities today cleared police officers involved in the Oct. 9 fatal shooting of Edward A. Campbell in Flint Township of any wrongdoing.

It was not a close call, said Genesee County Prosecutor David S. Leyton who ruled officers who fired on Campbell and killed him acted properly and lawfully.

The only delay in ruling the shooting justifiable was the time it took for Leyton and his senior attorneys to independently review the reports and find time to meet.

It was an easy call and unanimous, Leyton said.

Cleared were Genesee County sheriffs Lt. Kevin Shanlian, Clayton Township Police Chief Chuck Melki, Flint Township police Officer Mark Schmitzer and off-duty Flint police Officer Terry Lewis.

Projectiles from rifles and shotguns fired by Shanlain, Melki and Schmitzer hit Campbell at least once. Lewis, who was with the other three officers, did not fire his weapon.

Campbells son, Edward Campbell Jr., 28, was laying on the floor acting like he was injured when Flint Township officers Kateri Hohn and Jeff Hovey arrived at the Hunter's Ridge Manor apartments.

The elder Campbell, 50, opened fire on the two officers, striking both, authorities said.
