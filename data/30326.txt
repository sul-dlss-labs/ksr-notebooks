LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WAVE) – A man died following an officer-involved shooting in the Jacobs neighborhood has been identified.

Officers were conducting an investigation into a stolen vehicle that was found near Georgetown Place and Conn Alley around 9:40 a.m. Sunday, Louisville Metro Police Department spokeswoman officer Beth Ruoff said.

There were two adult men in the car who fled on foot and officers began to chase them.

One of the men, identified as Ryan Bernal, 32, by the Jefferson County Coroner’s Office, was found in the 3600 block of Georgetown Place and brandished a gun in front of the officers, which Ruoff said led to officers firing their weapons.

Bernal was sent to University of Louisville Hospital, where he died from his injuries on Monday, according to Kentucky State Police.

An autopsy for Bernal was scheduled to take place Tuesday.

Police were still searching for the second suspect on Sunday.

Kentucky State Police is the lead in the investigation into the officer-involved shooting.

The two LMPD officers who fired shots at the suspect have been placed on administrative leave pending the investigation as part of LMPD policy.
