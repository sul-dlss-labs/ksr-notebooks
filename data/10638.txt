A 52-year-old South Baltimore man, who was shot by police after pointing a pellet gun at officers, died from his injuries, officials said.

Anthony Guglielmi, the police department's chief spokesman, said officers were called to the 3600 block of St. Victor Street before 9 p.m. for a report of an armed person. When they got there, the man, who was holding what turned out to be a pellet gun, refused to drop the weapon and was shot when he turned toward the officers.

He was taken to a local hospital, where he later was pronounced dead. Guglielmi said officers were working to notify his next of kin, but said the man did not appear to have a criminal record. The officer who fired at the man has been placed on routine administrative suspension as detectives investigate.

City police have been involved in six shooting incidents this year, including the January incident outside Select Lounge in which two were killed and four injured. Overall, three people have died in police shooting this year.
