SALINA, Kan. (AP) Salina County authorities say an autopsy confirms that a man who was involved in a standoff with police last September killed himself.

Nineteen-year-old Marijan Gadson died by shooting himself in the head after hiding in the basement of a home for several hours while police tried to negotiate with him. The autopsy showed he had drugs and alcohol in his system.

Salina police officer Chuck Huen was shot in the eye by Gadson when he and four other officers went to a home to investigate a possible stolen car or domestic case. Huen lost his sight in the eye.

The Salina Journal reports Gadson was in the basement of a home when officers arrived and fired four shots. Officers entered the house hours later and found him dead.
