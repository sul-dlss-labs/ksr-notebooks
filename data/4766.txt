Houston Police Department > News Releases Update on Incident at 2300 Mason December 19, 2005 -- Houston police homicide investigators said three suspects arrested and charged in the shooting of a Houston police officer at 2300 Mason about 12:25 a.m. on December 15 have likely committed other crimes, prompting investigators to ask for other victims to come forward to identify the suspects. The three suspects are identified as Michael Martinez (H/m, DOB 11-13-83), Rodolfo Antonio Villalta (H/m, DOB 8-13-86) and Richard Garza (H/m, DOB 11-19-88). All three are charged with aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon in the 183rd State District Court. Villalta remains at Ben Taub General Hospital for treatment of gunshot wounds. A fourth suspect, Aurelio Ivan Chavez (H/m, DOB 9-25-81), was fatally shot in an exchange of gunfire. Photos of the three surviving suspects are attached to this news release. The officer, working undercover at the time of the shooting, sustained a gunshot wound to the abdomen and ankle. He was transported to Memorial Herman Hospital and is in good condition. HPD narcotics officers were conducting an investigation in the 2300 block of Mason when they were approached by four Hispanic males in a small, gold Toyota four-door vehicle. The suspects approached the officers and asked if the officers would be interested in purchasing marijuana. The officers said they were not interested and the suspects left. The suspects returned and asked the officers if they were interested in purchasing cocaine. When the officers approached the suspects in an attempt to arrange and negotiate the transaction, two of the suspects attempted to rob one of the officers. The suspects produced guns and began firing at officers. The officers returned fire, striking and fatally injuring one of the suspects. One other suspect was apprehended at the scene and two others fled. They were apprehended a short time later hiding under a house in the 200 block of Stratford. Anyone who might have been victimized by one or more of the three suspects is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600. Update JFC/MES 12-19-05
