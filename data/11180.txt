Police say 18-year-old Tendai Nhekairo approached officers responding to a suspicious-persons call at the Riverside House Apartments on Shadowood Parkway. "Officers encountered a male in the breezeway who was nude and armed with two knives," according to a statement. "When the male attempted to feloniously assault one of the officers, he defended himself by discharging his firearm at the suspect."

The incident occurred Tuesday around 7:30 p.m. Police have not released the name of the officer involved but said he has been placed on routine administrative leave as the investigation continues. Campbell High is reported to be holding a memorial service Wednesday night at 7:30 at the flagpole outside the school.
