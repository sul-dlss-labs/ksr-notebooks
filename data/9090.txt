BLOOMFIELD -- The teen suspect who allegedly fired into a crowd of 1,500 carnival attendees in Bloomfield Friday night and was then shot by a police officer died from his wound today, authorities said.

Rasheed Cherry, 17, of East Orange, accused of spraying several rounds into the crowded carnival near Watessing Avenue and Franklin Street on Friday night died today at 12:26 p.m. at University Hospital in Newark, said Acting Essex County Prosecutor Robert D. Laurino.

During the carnival shooting, Cherry allegedly struck another teen in the left elbow before he was shot in the torso by a Bloomfield police officer, authorities said.

Deputy Chief Assistant Prosecutor Thomas Fennelly said, “At this juncture, the shooting appears to be justified but the investigation is continuing.’’

Cherry was charged with aggravated assault, two weapons crimes and resisting arrest.

The victim, also a 17 year old from East Orange, was treated and released from Clara Maass Hospital in Belleville after the incident.

An autopsy is scheduled for Wednesday while the shooting is being investigated by the prosecutor’s office professional standards bureau and the Bloomfield Police Department’s Internal Affairs Unit.
