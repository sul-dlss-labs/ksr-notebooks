An off-duty Dallas officer intervened in a stabbing this morning and shot the suspect dead a block from police headquarters.

The officer-involved shooting was reported about 9:30 a.m. in the 1200 block of South Lamar Street, near South Side on Lamar and Gilley's nightclub.

The female officer, Sgt. Jackie Moore, was walking to work when she noticed an argument across the street at Wells Wrecking, Maj. Jeff Cotner said. Employees there say a suspicious man was trespassing inside the demolition company's fenced-in lot and pulled a knife when they tried to escort him out.

The suspect wounded a male employee, and a female employee screamed for help and called 911. Moore, a 15-year veteran, pulled her weapon and shot the suspect, who died at the scene.

The wounded man was taken to Baylor University Medical Center in unknown condition. Police are hopeful he will recover.

"We're very optimistic about that," Cotner said. "Once he recovers, we'll be able to talk to him and get a better understanding."

Six blocks of Lamar Boulevard just south of downtown was shut down in both directions after the shooting.
