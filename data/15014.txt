Officials have released the name of an armed man shot and killed by deputy rounds in Livingston Parish. He is 48-year-old Freddie W. LeBlanc.

The incident happened in Albany, La., in the 31000 block of Highway 1040 (Old Baton Rouge Highway) in Livingston Parish around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday.

Sheriff Jason Ard says deputies responded to a call about an attempted suicide with a gun. When deputies arrived, they found LeBlanc with a gun and an incident ensued and the man was shot and killed by deputy rounds.

In a news release from the Livingston Parish Sheriff's Office, officials said "LPSO Deputies repeatedly demanded the subject drop his weapon. Despite repeated demands, the subject refused and turned his weapon on LPSO Deputies. Because of the imminent threat, the subject was shot by LPSO Deputies."

The case is still being investigated. Louisiana State Police are assisting with the investigation.
