ASHTABULA COUNTY, Ohio â€” A male suspect is dead following an encounter with Ashtabula County Sheriff's deputies Thursday morning.

According to Sheriff William R. Johnson, his office received a call just after 7 a.m. regarding possible shots fired on East 39th Street in Ashtabula Township. Once deputies arrived, they located the home and saw a woman inside yelling for help and saying someone was inside with a gun.

After deputies identified themselves and entered the home, Johnson says they encountered a man wearing a bullet-proof vest who had a shotgun, two other firearms, and knives. He allegedly did not listen to orders to drop his weapon, turned the gun toward the officers, and was shot by law enforcement.
