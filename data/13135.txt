ST. REGIS – The St. Regis man killed by a Montana Highway Patrol trooper on Wednesday told family members he had a rifle aimed at a law officer while they were searching for him, authorities said Friday.

Sanders County Coroner Kathy Harris identified the man as Howard Curtis Martin, 62, of St. Regis.

Anastasia Burton, a spokeswoman for the Montana attorney general’s office, said Martin was armed when he left his home at 4 Monte Circle, St. Regis, on Wednesday evening.

“He (Martin) called a family member while officers were searching for him, telling her that he had a law enforcement officer in the crosshairs of his scope and indicated he was on a ridge near his home,” Burton wrote in an email. “During an armed encounter with officers, the suspect would not follow commands to drop the rifle.

“The initial investigation indicates that the suspect raised the weapon toward officers, at which point he was shot and killed by Montana Highway Patrol Trooper Adam Gane of Missoula.”

Burton said Gane has seven years of law enforcement experience, two of them with the Highway Patrol. He is on administrative leave pending the investigation.

Four state Division of Criminal Investigation officers were still examining the scene of the shooting on Friday.

The complete investigation was expected to continue a few more weeks, Burton said.

Mineral County Attorney Marcia Boris is expected to schedule a coroner’s inquest after the state investigation is finished.
