A three-hour stand-off that saw Chicago police officers camped outside a West Pullman neighborhood home ended when officers discovered the 41-year-old resident dead inside from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said.

Officers called to perform a well-being check in the 12800 block of South Emerald Avenue jumped for cover after a gunshot rang out as they approached the residence just before 8:42 p.m. Tuesday, police said.

From there, the officers initiated a barricade situation, where they set up a perimeter and tried to open communication with the person inside, police said.

At about 11:48 p.m., officers entered the home and found the resident dead in an apparent suicide, police said.
