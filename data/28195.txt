LEXINGTON, N.C. — A standoff in Lexington is over and a suspect is dead, according to information from Lexington police and the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office.

An officer came to a home on Northview Drive after a reported breaking and entering Thursday afternoon.

Police were called by a 13-year-old who said they had retreated outside along with their 11- and 4-year-old siblings.

When the officer arrived, the suspect, identified as Juan Carlos Lopez, fired shots at him.

The officer’s patrol car was hit and the officer was grazed. He was not seriously injured.

Lopez barricaded himself in the home, authorities said.

Officers tried to get Lopez to come out and called for him several times with no response.

When officers entered the home, they found Lopez dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The children were not injured during the incident.
