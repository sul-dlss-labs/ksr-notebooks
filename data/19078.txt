STILLWATER -- A man was shot to death at a Stillwater apartment complex Friday morning after firing on three Stillwater police, hitting Officer Randy Hiner in the leg, Captain Randy Dickerson said.

All three officers, Hiner, John Kruithof and Sgt. Rodger Wall, returned fire at Thomas Hicks Jr., 24, who was pronounced dead at the scene, Dickerson said. The officers have been routinely suspended with pay during an investigation.

Hicks's ex-girlfriend, whose name was not released, had obtained an emergency protective order against Hicks in Lincoln County District Court on Aug. 29, a news release says.

She called Stillwater police at 8:29 a.m. Friday to report that Hicks had called her on the phone and said he was enroute to her residence. She was still on the phone with a Stillwater police dispatcher when she said that Hicks had arrived at the front door of her apartment, the release says.

She gave the dispatcher a description of Hicks, who was contacted in the breezeway of her building at Whispering Hills, which was formerly known as Southern Heights Apartments, at 3102 S. Main, the release says.

"Officers attempted to detain Hicks and a struggle ensued. Officers sprayed Hicks with pepper spray and he continued to resist. During the struggle, Hicks produced a handgun and fired on officers," the release says.

The wounded Stillwater police officer, who is the son of retired Payne County Sheriff Carl Hiner, was transported to Stillwater Medical Center for treatment and is in stable condition, the release says.

Stillwater police are investigation the shooting incident in conjunction with the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation, Dickerson said.

Dickerson said that it has not yet been determined how many shots were fired by Hicks and the officers.
