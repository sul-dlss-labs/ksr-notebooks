Police say a man who killed himself during a five-hour standoff with authorities on Sunday was a suspect in a child sex case.

Lisa Cox, spokeswoman for the Springfield Police Department, said police were called out to a house in the 1000 block of West Madison Street at 11:30 a.m. Sunday to check on a man who had been making suicidal statements to family members.

Cox said a standoff ensued with officers using a megaphone to try to coax the man outside. Madison Street was blocked throughout the afternoon.

Police entered the home at about 4:30 p.m. and found the man, 23-year-old Augustine Chavez, dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

At some point Sunday, apparently during the standoff, prosecutors charged Chavez with first-degree statutory sodomy. The alleged crime, which involved an young girl, took place in November, according to police.
