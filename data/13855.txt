The State Bureau of Investigation has cleared three officers involved in a deadly shooting last month in Greenville.

Killed was 24-year-old James Brown on December 22nd.

Advanced Patrol Officer A.C. Pool, Advanced Patrol Officer S.N. Cates, and Advanced Patrol Officer A.K. Leggett, were originally placed on administrative leave after the shooting.

In a news release, Greenville police say the three have been cleared to return to duty. “While these officers have been cleared to return to full duty, we will not return them to street duties until they have received the proper counseling and care required after a traumatic incident of this magnitude,” said Chief Hassan Aden.

Police were originally called around 6:30 p.m. that night for the report of a suicidal man at the Vineyard Townhome complex, according to investigators.

Officers said they found Brown along a small bridge on Forlines Road near Reedy Branch Road, where they engaged him.

Investigators said Brown turned his gun on police. That is when Greenville police fired at the man, hitting him.

Brown later died at Vidant Medial Center.

A man killed in December by Greenville police wrestled with an officer who later Tased him was then shot multiple times in the back when he reached around and pointed a gun toward officers behind him, according to an autopsy and officials.

James Lewis Brown Jr. of Greenville had cocaine, metabolites and other substances in his system when he was shot on Dec. 22 by three officers during the altercation, according to reports received this week from the Office of the State Medical Examiner in Raleigh.

Police responded about 6:30 p.m. to a report of a suicidal, armed man at Vineyard Townhomes off Forlines Road and had information he consumed controlled substances and attempted to use a gun but it jammed, District Attorney Kimberly Robb said Friday.
