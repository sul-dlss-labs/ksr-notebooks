An off-duty rookie cop charged with mowing down a Bronx man reeked of booze and looked so "tanked" after the crash that prosecutors charged him with driving while intoxicated - even though his blood-alcohol content was under the legal limit, sources said.

Officer Luis Arnao, 25, smelled of alcohol and had "watery and glassy eyes" after killing Tyre Chisholm, 22, with his 2011 Honda Accord as Chisholm crossed White Plains Road in Wakefield about 4 a.m Wednesday, according to court records.

Arnao blew a .07 on his breath test, surpassing the state's .05 legal threshold for impairment but falling short of the .08 reading that proves intoxication, cops said.

Authorities slapped him with the intoxication charge anyway because of Arnao's behavior and other observations made by the arresting officer, sources said.

Arnao also faces vehicular manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide charges. The suspended cop is free on $20,000 bond.
