YORK, Pa. (AP) – State police say they have found a man dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after a nearly six-hour standoff at his mobile home in south-central Pennsylvania.

Police were called to the mobile home in West Manchester Township, near York, about 12:45 p.m. Sunday.

That’s when the niece of 67-year-old Barry Hess reported that he was threatening suicide and had already fired one gunshot.

Police say Hess didn’t threaten anyone and the public wasn’t in danger. But police had to take precautions because they knew Hess was armed.

Police say Hess wouldn’t answer his phone or respond to authorities before a camera-equipped robot was sent into the residence and confirmed that Hess was dead about 6:20 p.m.
