Two Prince George's County Sheriff's deputies were involved in a fatal shooting Sunday night in Landover, Maryland.

Authorities say the deputies were pursuing the vehicle of a suspect in a domestic violence attack involving a knife about 9 p.m. when the suspect rammed his truck into two deputies' vehicle.

The deputies fired their service weapons, striking the man. He was pronounced dead at the scene in the 900 block of Nalley Road.

He has been identified as 34-year-old Lionel Lorenzo Young of Landover.

The Prince George's County Police Department is investigating the shooting, as is routine, the Sheriff's Office said.

The deputies involved in the shooting are five- and six-year veterans. They have been placed on routine administive leave pending the outcome of the investigation.

More information on the deputies will be released Tuesday, authorities said.
