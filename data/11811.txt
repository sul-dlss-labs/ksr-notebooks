CHICAGO (CBS) -- At least six men have been killed and at least 23 people have been injured in various shootings in Chicago from friday night to early Monday.

The most recent fatal shooting victim was a man caught up in a love triangle on the Southwest Side.

The man was at a residence with a woman in the 4500 block of South Lavergne Avenue when the woman's ex-boyfriend showed up and tried to get inside, police said. The pair refused to let in the ex-boyfriend while he continued to pound on doors and windows and scream at them, according to police. Eventually, he got into his vehicle drove off.

Sometime later, about 12:10 a.m., the man left the residence, thinking the ex-boyfriend had gone, police said. As he got into his own vehicle to leave, the ex-boyfriend appeared and shot him several times in the head and chest. The man was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn where he died, police said. The ex-boyfriend was arrested.

The dead man was identified as Delon Brandon, 25, of another residence in the 4500 block of South Lavergne Avenue, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's office. He was pronounced dead at 1:05 a.m.
