Initial call was for a domestic dispute, police say

Authorities said officers responded to reports of a domestic dispute after 9 p.m. in the 700 block of Twincrest Court. Officials said the responding Springfield Township officer claimed he arrived on scene and fired eight to nine shots. The Hamilton County Police Association posted on Facebook that the officer is okay. Police have not released the names of the man who was shot, nor that of the officer involved. The officer has been placed on administrative leave, per standard procedure. Neighbors said police were at the home for about 20 minutes before shots were fired. Police said a gun was recovered at the scene. The department's last officer-involved shooting was in June, when a suspect shot a police dog, then an officer shot the suspect. The suspect survived and was charged. WLWT's Brian Hamrick will have more on this story on WLWT at 5 p.m.
