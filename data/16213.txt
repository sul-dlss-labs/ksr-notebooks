He was treated by emergency medical workers, who arrived around 8:20 a.m. and gave Mr. Ocasio medication to calm him down, according to a city official who was briefed on the episode but not authorized to describe the medical response. The official said the man might have ingested synthetic marijuana known as K-2.

Mr. Ocasio went into cardiac arrest after being placed in the ambulance, the police said, and his handcuffs were removed. He was pronounced dead at 9:50 at North Central Bronx Hospital.

The city medical examiner is investigating the cause of death.

The death was the second in police custody in less than a month in the northern Bronx precinct. In May, a 40-year-old man, Denis Reyes, went into cardiac arrest as police officers took him into custody on East 194th Street; the cause of his death remains under investigation by the medical examiner.

The department has proceeded cautiously over the years to expand the use of stun guns to subdue resistant suspects, even as the police around the country now routinely employ them. The police commissioner, William J. Bratton, has said he was exploring giving the stun guns to more city officers.

The role of the Taser in the death of Mr. Ocasio was not immediately known.

Mr. Ocasio, who served nearly two decades in state prison for a botched gunpoint robbery in which he fired at responding Bronx police officers, was known to neighbors in his building as a drug user.
