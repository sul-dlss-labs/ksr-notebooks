A Waukegan police officer was driving 10 m.p.h. over the speed limit when his squad car struck and killed the driver of a sedan in February, according to testimony Thursday at a Lake County coroner's inquest.

As Wilson Lopez-Ochoa, 21, of Waukegan, drove out of a laundry's parking lot in the 1800 block of Grand Avenue on Feb. 6, his 1990 Honda Civic was hit on the driver's side by a squad car driven by Officer Michael Newman.

Lopez-Ochoa was driving with a license that police say was obtained illegally and which identified him as Fernando Mejias-Gonzalez. He died in St. Therese Medical Center in Waukegan.

Rolando Lopez, Lopez-Ochoa's brother, filed a wrongful death suit in Lake County Circuit Court.

A coroner's jury ruled Lopez-Ochoa's manner of death was undetermined. The jury could have ruled the death a homicide, suicide or accident, but if it can't reach a unanimous verdict, the manner of death is ruled undetermined.
