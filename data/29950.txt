A suspect wanted in connection with an armed assault and attempted kidnapping was shot and killed by authorities in the parking lot of a Corona hotel Friday, April 2, authorities said.

The Riverside County Gang Impact Team, with assistance from a federal fugitive apprehension team, was conducting surveillance at the Welcome Inn, 1248 West Sixth Street, at around 5:30 p.m. when they spotted the suspect in the parking lot and attempted to take him into custody, said Corona police, who are investigating the officer-involved shooting.

At some point while attempting to arrest the suspect, members of the Gang Impact Team fired him, Corona police said. It wasn’t immediately known what led authorities to fire.

Investigators attempted life-saving measures, but the suspect died, police said. They said a firearm was found.

The suspect was not identified pending notification of his relatives. Police said the assault and attempted kidnapping had happened Thursday night, April 1, but it wasn’t disclosed where it occurred, what it involved or how the suspect was identified.

The Gang Impact Team is led by the Riverside County District Attorney’s Office Bureau of Investigation and is also staffed by Homeland Security Investigations, U.S. Marshals, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Special Services Unit, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department and detectives from other Riverside County city police agencies.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department is assisting Corona police with the investigation into the officer-involved shooting.
