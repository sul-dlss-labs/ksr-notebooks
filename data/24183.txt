COLUMBIA, SC (WIS) - One of three suspects involved in a high-speed chase on I-20 Monday has died from injuries suffered in the crash.

Richland County Coroner Gary Watts has identified the victim as 31-year-old Marcos Aguinaga of Hopkins.

Hopkins was an unrestrained passenger in a vehicle that struck a fence. The cause of death was due to blunt force trauma, according to Watts.

Two suspects involved in the chase were originally inside Lowe's stealing items when employees flagged an alert deputy down and notified him. When approached, the suspects ditched the stolen goods before entering a truck operated by a third suspect. The three left at a high rate of speed.

The vehicle refused to yield to blue lights and sirens and a chase ensued, ending on westbound I-20. The driver, 26-year-old Calvin Garrett Liabastre, intentionally tried to drive through the fence that divides the interstate's westbound and eastbound lanes, disabling the vehicle. Cpl. Rhyne said one of the fence posts came through the windshield and struck the passenger sitting up front.

According to the Richland County Sheriff's Department, Liabastre and the second male suspect were transported to Palmetto Health Richland Hospital for treatment, while a female suspect was arrested for processing. The second male suspect died in the hospital.

The vehicle was reported stolen out of Berkeley County and had additional stolen items inside the vehicle from "other locations."

The chase, crash, and arrest caused delays on Interstate 20, backing up traffic as far as the Fairfield Road exit.

Liabastre has now been charged with one felony count of DUI involving death.
