An officer shot and killed a man with a gun who fired at police in Paterson on Friday afternoon, sources said.

Police were responding to reports of an emotionally disturbed person with a handgun when they encountered the man outside a home near East 18th and Fulton streets, according to sources.

The man allegedly started firing at the Paterson officer before he was shot just after 2 p.m. He was taken to St. Joseph's Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead.

Further details about the shooting weren’t immediately available, and the Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office hasn’t released any information.

Shaqwanda Jefferson says the man who was killed is her sister's fiance. Her sister is seven months pregnant with the couple's daughter.

"I'm just waiting to see if she's okay," Jefferson said Friday night.

Another relative said the expectant mother was inside the home on Fulton Place where the shooting broke out.

Rattled onlookers recorded video of Paterson police drawing their guns. At least 15 shots can be heard in the background.

Police tape cordoned off a block near the shooting on Friday evening. Sources said investigators recovered the gun that the man allegedly fired at the officer before he was shot.

The names of the officer and the man who was shot and killed have not been released.

The shooting is the second time a Paterson police officer has shot and killed a person since early March. Ramon Andrade, 37, was allegedly waving a knife when he was shot and injured by a Paterson officer on March 2. He died two weeks later.
