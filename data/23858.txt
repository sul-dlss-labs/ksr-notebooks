Update (1 p.m. Wednesday): Tulsa police identified the man killed while allegedly fleeing police in early February as Johnny Reed, 31, according to Tulsa Police Officer Jeanne MacKenzie.

Reed was struck and killed Feb. 1 by a motor vehicle on Interstate 44 while allegedly fleeing Tulsa police officers, who stopped him for jaywalking. Police identified the man Wednesday, a day after releasing body-worn camera footage of the foot chase.

The story as it originally appeared in the Tulsa World remains below.

Tulsa Police on Tuesday released video from an officer's lapel camera showing a Feb. 1 foot chase with a jaywalking suspect that ended in his death in an auto-pedestrian collision.

Police have never publicly named the man, but the newly released video shows that officers stopped him for jaywalking about 2:45 p.m. near 11th Street and Garnett Road.

As the officer checked the man's drivers license in the parking lot of a pizza restaurant, the man said, "Can I be honest?" and confessed to having a marijuana cigarette in his hand. The officer instructed him to put his hands behind his back, but instead, the man took off running.

The officer chased him up an embankment of Interstate 44 and when the officer got to the top, he saw that the man had been struck by a vehicle.

As the man lay bleeding in the eastbound lanes, the officer tried to flag down oncoming traffic to stop and radioed dispatchers for an ambulance and a medical examiner to come to the scene.
