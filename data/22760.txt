A man was killed Thursday night during an exchange of gunfire between a police officer and the man, authorities said.

Leeds Police Chief Ronald Reaves said officers were responding to a call about a dog shot in the Cahaba Hills subdivision at 6:45 pm. While officers were talking to witnesses for that incident, authorities heard gunshots in the area.

The officers went towards the gunshots and encountered an armed man in the 1000 block of Melissa Circle. Reaves said the man was a resident of the area.

After officers instructed the man to put down his weapon, police said the man started shooting at the officers. Reaves said an officer fired two rounds at the man, who died at the scene. No officers were injured during the exchange of gunfire, Reaves said.

The name of the deceased man has not been released. Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is assisting with the investigation.

As protocol, the SBI will investigate the shooting and the officer who fired the weapon will be placed administrative leave until the investigation is complete.
