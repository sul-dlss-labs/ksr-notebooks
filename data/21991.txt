Authorities identified the man who was shot and killed by Newark police Friday night after he brandished a gun at an officer.

Steven Vierra, 40, Newark, walked up to undercover police, who were at Clinton Place and Weequahic Avenue around 9:30 p.m., and pulled out a gun in an apparent attempt to rob one of the officers, said Paul Loriquet, spokesman for Essex County Prosecutor's Office.The officers ordered the man to surrender his weapon, said Newark police Detective Todd McClendon. The man failed to do so, instead raising the handgun and aiming it at one of the officers. Two officers shot Vierra, Loriquet said.

Vierra was taken to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 10:03 p.m., Loriquet said. An autopsy is scheduled Sunday.

None of the officers were injured in the encounter, Loriquet said. Because it was a police-involved shooting, the prosecutor's office is investigating the incident.

"It's all protocol and they submit everything (information) to a grand jury," said Loriquet.
