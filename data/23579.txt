ST. JOHNS -- A 31-year-old Potterville man died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the parking lot of a former St. Johns school after hours of negotiation with police, according to a statement from the Clinton County Sheriff’s Office.

The incident led officials to close roads near East Olive Elementary School in St. Johns for several hours Wednesday afternoon and evening.

Sheriff’s deputies were called to the school shortly before 1 p.m. Wednesday after a man there called dispatch to say that he was suicidal and had a handgun with him, police said.

A Clinton County negotiator spoke with the man for several hours before he shot himself.

East Olive Elementary has been closed since June and no children or staff were on scene at the time of the incident.
