ATWATER â€” Merced County sheriff's deputies shot and killed a 34-year-old man after they say he demanded they shoot him and threatened them with a gun.

Mario Perez Garcia was shot twice in the torso, then taken to Merced Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after, according to the Sheriff's Department.

Deputies had been called to the scene around 7:40 p.m. Friday to investigate a report that an intoxicated man was trying to shoot himself, said sheriff's spokesman Scott Dover.

When they arrived at Garcia's home, he was outside holding a handgun and acting "very agitated," according to reports. The deputies allegedly tried to negotiate with Garcia for 15 to 20 minutes, as he repeatedly demanded that they shoot him.

A deputy shot Garcia after he pointed his gun at him and his partner, Dover said. "It was clear he was pointing it right at them and preparing to fire," he said.

Authorities planned to conduct an autopsy and toxicology screening on the body to determine whether Garcia had been under the influence of drugs or alcohol. /AP
