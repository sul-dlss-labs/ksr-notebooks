Authorities have identified a man who committed suicide Tuesday after firing shots at two Laguna Beach police patrol cars as he drove along Pacific Coast Highway.

Daniel Armijo, 36, of San Pedro shot himself about 3 p.m., authorities said. Neither officer was struck. Armijo was driving his Chevy Silverado pickup north on PCH when he opened fire on the police cars, authorities said. Armijo pulled into the left-turn lane at Cress Street, stopped and shot himself in the head as police closed in.

“They told him to exit the truck, and he shot himself in the head,” said witness Joel Murphy 49. “I was pretty shocked,” he said. “I figured he’d exit the truck, but he didn’t; it was kind of upsetting.” Laguna Beach Police Sgt. Darin Lenyi said one of the patrol cars was damaged by the gunfire.
