A Westminster officer who shot and killed a man who attacked him in April will not face criminal charges, according to investigators.

Kevin Beasley Jr., who was 23 at the time of the incident, was shot by Officer Richard Fletcher, who was responding to a 911 call on April 26 in the 11500 block of Pecos Street, according to the Adams County district attorney’s office.

Beasley was acting erratic and violent, throwing rocks at people, threatening people and stepping in front of traffic, witnesses told investigators.

Fletcher arrived about 12:35 p.m., and Beasley attacked him immediately, according to a letter, dated Thursday, about the shooting from District Attorney Dave Young to Police Chief Tim Carlson.

Witnesses described Beasley punching Fletcher in the face and head and attempting to grab for the officer’s holstered gun, according to the letter. Fletcher recalled being pummeled, suffering a ringing in his ears and fears that he was about to pass out.

Fletcher told investigators his “biggest fear was that I’m gonna lose consciousness, he can continue his assault, he’s gonna take my gun, he’s gonna shoot me. … ”

While struggling with Beasley, Fletcher pulled his duty gun and, at close range, shot the assailant in the neck and in the right side of his upper back. The shooting happened within two minutes of Fletcher arriving.

“Officer Fletcher was justified in using deadly physical force” under the law, according to the letter. Fletcher was in “imminent danger of being killed or of receiving great bodily injury.

“Fletcher is justified under Colorado law … to use deadly physical force to defend himself.”
