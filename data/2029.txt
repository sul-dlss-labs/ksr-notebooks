CHICAGO â€” Family members of a Washington Heights man who died after being chased by Chicago police said Sunday that they will have a private autopsy performed because they don't have any answers from police or a county autopsy.

"All I want to do is get to the bottom of this and see how my child died," said the man's mother, Dorothy Decquir.

Louis Decquir, 37, a self-employed carpenter, died Friday after he was chased on foot by police who saw him at 4:15 p.m. walking with an open can of beer in the 8900 block of South Marshfield Avenue. After he was caught, Decquir told the officers that he had asthma and was having trouble breathing, police said.

Family members said Decquir had no history of respiratory disease and that witnesses told them officers put him in a chokehold.

The Cook County medical examiner's office said it had not determined a cause of death after an autopsy Saturday because it is waiting until more tests can be done and until police finish their investigation.

Police spokesman Thomas Donegan said police are waiting for the results of an Office of Professional Standards investigation into Decquir's death, a standard procedure when a person dies in police custody.
