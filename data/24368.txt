DADE CITY â€” A review by the Pasco County Sheriff's Office shows that a man killed last week in a deputy-involved shooting pointed his gun at deputies but never fired it, contradicting initial reports that he shot first.

Deputies responded Thursday evening to the Many Mansions RV Park after a resident reported that his roommate, 61-year-old James Palmquist, was suicidal, according to the sheriff's office. Palmquist wrote on social media around that time that he'd taken 100 pills.

Gunfire ensued. Thursday evening, Sheriff Chris Nocco said Palmquist had walked out of a mobile home brandishing a shotgun and yelling at deputies, and when he fired at deputies, they fired back. But the sheriff's office's review, which it announced Monday evening, showed that Palmquist never pulled the trigger.

Palmquist told deputies he didn't care if he died and raised his gun, the sheriff's office said Monday, which prompted deputies to shoot him. The gun was loaded and had its safety off, deputies said. After the shooting, Palmquist was taken to a local hospital, where he died.

The deputies involved, Aaron Ziegler and Sgt. Chad Tadlock, were placed on paid leave and will stay on leave until the state attorney's office finishes its investigation, according to the sheriff's office.
