The armed robbery suspect killed Wednesday during a police chase in Randolph has been identified by police as 37-year-old Michael Berg of Holbrook.

Berg died Wednesday after colliding head-on with another vehicle on Union Street as he fled from police, according to a news release.

The crash and robbery remains under investigation by Randolph police with the assistance of the Norfolk County District Attorney's office.

Police say a man walked into the Super Mart, located at 1151 North Main St., armed with a sawed-off shotgun around 3 p.m. The man demanded cash.

"During the robbery, the man fired the shotgun into the floor of the store," police said. No one was hurt.

The suspect stole cash and drove away in a blue 2009 Pontiac G6 sedan.

Holbrook police officers found the vehicle and the suspect, Berg, at a Holbrook home. The car was still in the driveway along with Berg, according to police. Police told Berg to stop, but police said he got back into his car and drove off, almost striking the officers.

Authorities say Berg led police on a chase from Holbrook back into Randolph.

"At approximately 4:30 p.m., the pursuit ended when the driver crossed into the oncoming lane and crashed head-on into another vehicle near 306 Union St. in Randolph," police said.

Berg was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead. The male driver of the other vehicle was taken to an area hospital. He is expected to survive.
