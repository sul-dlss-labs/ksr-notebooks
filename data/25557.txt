Court records show a history of charges for Randy Pierson.

Pierson was identified as the man who allegedly shot himself to death Wednesday during a traffic stop at Bypass 20 and Montague. Police say he showed a gun during a traffic stop and died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

According to Minnesota court records, Pierson was indicted on 15 charges related to theft between Dec. 2015 and Nov. 2016. The Stearns County Attorney's Office says Pierson was scheduled for a sentencing hearing on Oct. 5, 2017, but failed to appear in court.

The attorneyâ€™s office says Pierson had been wanted on warrant since skipping the Oct. 5 hearing. Pierson pled guilty to 10 theft-by-swindling charges in 2017.

Pierson formerly owned Avon Marine, a Minnesota boating business, in central Minnesota. He had 14 open cases against him for crimes he allegedly committed between 2011 and 2016.

The death is being investigated by the Winnebago County Integrity Task Force. A spokesperson from the Winnebago County Integrity Task Force says they are familiar with Pierson's past charges.
