Authorities today identified the suspected bank robber shot Friday by Loxley police as Raymond Schaefer, 48, of Dulac, La.

Officers shot and killed Schaefer on Friday morning off the grassy shoulder of eastbound Interstate 10. Less than a half-hour earlier, Schaefer allegedly used a handgun to rob the Regions Bank across from the Eastern Shore Centre in Spanish Fort.

Officials with the Baldwin County Sheriff's Office, which is handling the investigation, have said Schaefer forced the officers to shoot him by threatening them with his handgun after leaping from his truck after police stopped it on I-10 east of Loxley.
