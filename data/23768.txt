Surveillance video evidence was released at a news conference Tuesday, as the district attorney said police were justified when they shot and killed a man in Homewood.Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen Zappala said Mark Daniels, 39, fired three shots before being fatally shot by Pittsburgh police early on the morning of Feb. 11.Daniels was illegally carrying a gun that had been purchased by someone else, said Zappala. He added that it remains unclear why Daniels decided to fire the weapon, but "a reasonable conclusion" might be that Daniels didn't know they were police officers.Tap the video player above to watch the full video of the DA's news conference.Below is a recap of the news conference from Pittsburgh's Action News 4 reporter Jim Madalinsky: - District Attorney’s office showing the video that led to the shooting of Mark Daniels. This is one video from outside Betts Market that shows Daniels leaving the area. Police said he looked agitated and angry.- The Pittsburgh police officer that fired the shots that killed Mark Daniels identified as Ofc. Gino Maciocie. He’s been with the department 5 and a half years. Zappala says evidence shows Daniels fired his weapon three times at the officers at the scene. Maciocie fired 3 shots.- 3 bullet holes were found in a downspout at a nearby church. Zappala says Ofc Maciocie was in the line of fire but the shots were high. Forensics shows those 3 shots were fired in less than half a second.- Zappala: After Daniels and Maciocie exchanged three shots each, Ofc. Maciocie fires his weapon 4 more times according to forensics.- The second four shots were fired about a block away from where the initial gunfire was exchanged.- Zappala says this is the glock 40 Daniels used. It was purchased in December by a woman. Zappala says it was a straw purchase and that woman will be charged.- Zappala says Daniels was initially shot in the forearm, severing his brachial artery and he was losing blood fast. One element of gun powder was found on Daniels right hand.- Zappala says Daniels was tracked to Bennett Street. Disagreement there on what happened next. Officers claimed they were starting CPR. The resident on Bennett Street did not report that, only saying officers were asking for the gun, which Daniels had dropped earlier.- Zappala ultimately says that by law the shooting of Mark Daniels was justified because he fired upon officers first and was a continued threat, even though he was shot in the second round of gunfire a block away from the initial confrontation.- Daniels was shot in the back of his left forearm as he ran away. Zappala says "the community should be concerned about that" but legally he was a still a threat to police.- Wanted to clarify this before I posted it. This is when Mark Daniels was shot. This video shows the second round of gunfire from Ofc. Maciocie as Daniels fled across the street. Top right corner of the screen.Click here to read a detailed timeline of the incident from police.
