OAKLAND â€” A man fatally shot Tuesday night by California Highway Patrol officers who said he ran from an SUV and pointed a gun at them, has been identified as Jose Munguia, 21, of Oakland, authorities said Friday.

Police said they believe they have recovered the Toyota SUV that Munguia ran from, whose driver drove off after the shooting.

Police have not confirmed yet if it is the same vehicle, which was found on fire about 5:30 a.m. Thursday in the 1500 block of 67th Avenue. If it turns out to be the same SUV, it was stolen in San Jose sometime before the shooting, police said.

Two CHP officers in a marked patrol car stopped the vehicle about 9 p.m. Tuesday in the 5200 block of Wentworth Avenue in East Oakland for not having license plates.

Munguia ran from the vehicle holding a loaded pistol, that police said had an extended magazine.

A dog with the officers started chasing him and had engaged Munguia who was shot after the officers said he pointed the gun at them, police said. The dog was wounded in its paw by one of the CHP gunshots.

While the officers were giving Munguia first aid, the driver of the SUV drove off, possibly with other passengers. Munguia died at the scene and police are still seeking whoever else was in the SUV.

About 3 a.m. Tuesday 19-year-old Antonio Mestas of Oakland was also fatally shot by two CHP officers after running from a stolen SUV and pointing a gun at them, authorities said. The shooting happened on a cul-de-sac in the 5700 block of East 15th Street at the end of a chase that started on High Street near Interstate 580 after the officers tried to stop the SUV for not having license plates.
