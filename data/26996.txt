The man who was tased by Mobile Police resisting arrest after attempting to break into a home has died.

According to Mobile police Christopher McCorvey, 36, passed away Wednesday morning after suffering a cardiac arrest while being apprehended by police Monday afternoon.

Police responded to a home on Old Pascagoula Road and Johnston Road Monday afternoon in reference to McCorvey allegedly breaking into vehicles and attempting to break into a couple of homes. After officers found McCorvey and tried to apprehend him, he resisted arrest and was tased by officers in efforts to subdue him.

The initial shot from the taser was unsuccessful as McCorvey fled on foot and jumped a fence. He was apprehended within a short distance, MPD says. As officers attempted to arrest him a second time with the assistance of two Mobile County deputies, he continued to resist arrest. An officer then touch tased him, bringing McCorvey into full compliance.

In the process of the arrest, McCorvey went into cardiac arrest and was transported to the hospital where he died less than 48 hours later.

Authorities are currently awaiting autopsy results before they release anymore information on the case.
