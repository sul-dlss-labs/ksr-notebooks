A Newaygo County man died last Saturday after he refused a police request to go outside and talk, and instead armed himself with what police later found was a bb/pellet gun.

According to Michigan State Police Public Information Officer Spl/Lt. Michelle Robinson, two troopers from the Hart Post were dispatched to a domestic assault in Beaver Township, Newaygo County, on Saturday, May 22 about 8:50 a.m.

A 63-year-old man named Johnny Owen King had been living at the address near the intersection of West 10 Mile Road and Comstock Avenue in Beaver Township, between Hesperia and Bitely. According to a report by WOODTV-8, the man had been living on the property with his uncle and his uncle’s ex-wife, and the assault allegedly occurred between King and his uncle’s ex-wife.

MSP said that the troopers were inside of a travel trailer on the property when they requested that King come outside to talk with them. King refused and armed himself with what appeared to be a rifle, at which time he was shot.

Despite life-saving efforts, the subject was declared deceased on scene.

The weapon that the man had has been examined by the MSP Grand Rapids forensic laboratory and has been identified as a .177 caliber pneumatic gun.

The troopers were not injured and have been placed on critical incident leave per Department policy pending investigation.
