According to police, Friday's chase ended when Logan cut across four lanes in an attempt to exit and veered out of control, striking a sand barrel and a semi-trailer truck, police said.

Logan stepped out of the vehicle and opened fire with a semi-automatic weapon on the officer who had been chasing him. Logan was killed by two officers who responded to calls for backup, officials say.
