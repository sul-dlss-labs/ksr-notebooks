CARTER , JEREMY WILLIAM -- Memorial services for Jeremy William Carter , 31, of Madera will be at 10 a.m. July 16 at Cornerstone Church in Fresno. Mr. Carter , who was employed in telemarketing sales, died Sunday. Arrangements are by Cremation Society of Central California in Fresno.



Jeremy Carter: Armed man killed by police was parolee who immediately caught police officers' attention when he walked by.



Carter, 31, matched the description of the murder suspect for whom they were searching in a central Fresno neighborhood. When police told him to stop, he ran. And when a police dog caught him, he pulled a handgun from his pocket, according to authorities.



Carter was not the murder suspect, but he died Sunday night when an officer shot him. He was killed during a struggle with officers after being knocked to the ground by the police dog.



Carter grabbed the semiautomatic handgun, which had been jarred from his grip during his fall, an instant before he was fatally shot, Fresno police officials said Tuesday.



Carter, a parolee, used methamphetamine for most of his life, his family said Tuesday, but he was also a caring man who became "lost" when those closest to him died tragically.



"There's more to it than a body on the street," said his aunt, Deborah Konkle. "I don't want people to read this and say, 'Oh yeah, another tweaker gone.' "



Police were searching the 1400 block of Sussex Way at Glenn Avenue on Sunday when they saw Carter.



Investigators were looking for a man who on Thursday had killed David Dewayne Smith. Smith, a homeless man, was shot while rummaging for aluminum cans at a bus stop outside a Tulare health center.



Tulare police believe the suspect was in Fresno by Friday. Officers from the Tulare and Fresno police departments were in the Sussex Way neighborhood Sunday looking for the shooter, described as a white man in his 30s with a shaved head and tattoos.



When Carter walked by, officers thought they had their man. His age, height, weight and tattoos resembled those of the murder suspect.



Carter ran, ignoring orders to stop, and officers' suspicions that he was the suspect were reinforced, Fresno police Lt. Randy Dobbins said.



A police dog chased Carter. When it caught him, biting and holding him by one of his legs, Carter grabbed his gun, Dobbins said. Carter soon fell to the ground, and the semiautomatic handgun was knocked from his hand.



Two officers were quickly on top of Carter, and one attempted to stun him with a Taser, which discharges an electrical shock meant to immobilize a suspect.



But Carter was unfazed, Dobbins said, and reached for the handgun. Officers yelled, "Gun! Gun! Gun!" and when Carter grabbed the gun, he was shot.



The officer, whose identity was not released, fired because he believed Carter would have shot him or the other officer who was attempting to restrain him, Dobbins said. The officer who fired the fatal shot is on paid administrative leave pending the investigation.



An autopsy was being performed on Carter's body Tuesday afternoon, and authorities would not say how many times he was shot. Toxicology tests also will be conducted.



It was the seventh officer-involved shooting by a Fresno police officer this year. Three people have died this year after being shot by Fresno police.



Carter had a long criminal history, and most of his arrests involved drugs.



By 2002, he had five felony convictions, including, ranging from drug sales and possession offenses, auto theft and receiving stolen property, according to state parole records.



In May 2002, he was charged with selling and possessing drugs, battery on a police officer, driving without a license and possessing a firearm.



Two months later he pleaded not contest to the firearm charge, and the others were dropped. Carter served a prison term from July 29, 2002, to June 13, 2003, and was placed on parole for three years.



While on parole, he was arrested Sept. 3, 2003, for absconding from parole supervision and resisting arrest. He was returned to prison for nine months and released May 30, 2004.



Carter was arrested again Aug. 10, 2004, on a parole violation for possession of burglary tools and possession of methamphetamine. He returned to state prison for 10 months and was released June 6.



"Jeremy had been on drugs on and off most of his life," said Konkle, whom Carter called Auntie Debbie.



Konkle described her nephew as a troubled young man, struck by tragedy. His mother killed herself 14 years ago, Konkle said, and three years ago his brother died in a car crash.



He once told Konkle that he had no one left. "He was just sort of lost," she said.



Carter kept in touch with relatives while in prison and often wrote to a 15-year-old cousin who was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor.



After his most recent release, Konkle said, Carter did not visited the family -- something she took to be a sign of more trouble. Often in the past, when he did come by, his drug use would be evident.



"He'd come over and be all hopped up on meth or something," she said.



Konkle would offer him money to buy something "to put in his stomach, not in his nose," but she said she despaired over being unable to rescue him from his self-destructive habits.
