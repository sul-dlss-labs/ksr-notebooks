A man was killed and a deputy was injured Tuesday afternoon during a pursuit near Iva, Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper said.

Alexander Chance Partain, 31, of Iva died as the result of a gunshot wound that he suffered in the chase, said Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore. The deputy, whose name had not been disclosed by authorities Tuesday night, suffered a head injury and is being treated at AnMed Health Medical Center, Shore said. The deputy's injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, officials said.

The pursuit started shortly before 1 p.m. on Bascomb Drive. Skipper said the deputy got behind a vehicle that then sped up dramatically.

Lt. Sheila Cole of the Sheriff's Office said the deputy had pulled the vehicle over on Bascomb Drive just outside Iva city limits when a man in the car jumped out and ran into a wooded area. The man was later identified as Partain.
