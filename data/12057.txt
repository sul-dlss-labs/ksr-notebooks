The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office is committed to transparency with our community. This includes sharing our policies so residents understand how our employees do the difficult work of keeping the community safe.

We review and update our policies regularly to ensure that we are in line with the best practices within the industry as well as are consistent with Colorado and federal law.

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office is currently undergoing an assessment through the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies (CALEA). CALEA ® is considered the “Gold Standard in Public Safety”. CALEA ® hosts a public portal to accept comments regarding the agency’s compliance with the accreditation process.

The purpose of this public portal is to receive comments regarding the agency’s ability to comply with the CALEA ® standards, engagement within the service community, delivery of public safety services, and overall candidacy for accredited status. These comments can be in the form of commendations or concerns. The overall intent of the accreditation process is to provide the participating agency with information to support continuous improvement, as well as foster the pursuit of professional excellence.
