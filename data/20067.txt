Man barricades himself in Dick's Sporting Goods bathroom and shoots himself after demanding to see shotgun

An armed man who demanded a shotgun from a sporting goods store near Philadelphia, then barricaded himself inside the bathroom and killed himself has been named.



Bucks County Coroner Joseph Campbell said Sunday that 58-year-old Mark McCarty of Levittown died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the chest.

The shop and n earby businesses were evacuated during a four-hour-long stand-off with dozens of police and SWAT teams. Authorities then sent a robot into the store that found McCarty deceased. No one else was hurt.



Standoff: The unidentified man walked into the sporting goods store and demanded a shotgun. When he didn't receive one, he barricaded himself in a bathroom and committed suicide

Authorities say he entered Dick's Sporting Goods in Fairless Hills after 7 p.m. Saturday and asked to see a shotgun and ammunition.



McCarty pulled out a handgun - later found to be unloaded - and ordered the worker to undo the shotgun's gun lock. The employee did so and McCarty ordered him to leave the store.

McCarty also came into the possession of shotgun shells. The man then barricaded himself inside a bathroom with the loaded gun.

Falls Police Lt. Henry Ward says McCarty had also been involved in a standoff with Middletown officers in 2002. Phillyburbs.com reports that he was involuntarily committed for mental health treatment in 2010.

'He had ample opportunity to do some bad things, but he didnâ€™t,' Lt. Ward said.



'This could have been a nightmare with people that were still in the store at the time going around having no idea what was going on at the time,' Ward added.
