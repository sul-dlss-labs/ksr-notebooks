The Tillamook County District Attorney today identified the man shot by sheriff's deputies in Garibaldi on Friday as Michael Elmo Shepherd, 68.

Shepherd, who has no known address, died during a confrontation with deputies after they received reports that someone had broken into a motor home in Garibaldi, about 10 miles north of Tillamook, authorities said. Relatives were located and notified in Clark County.

When deputies responded to the motor home in the 300 block of Sixth Street, they found Shepherd armed with a hatchet, authorities said. He then began advancing on the deputies, who warned him to put down the hatchet. When he continued to come at them, they shot him.

Shepherd was pronounced dead at the scene.
