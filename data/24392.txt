LAWRENCE COUNTY, Mo. – A 20-year-old Aurora man who was charged with multiple felonies in the death of Savannah Hill has accepted a plea bargain and been sentenced.

Mason Farris was originally charged with 2nd degree murder, 1st degree assault, armed criminal action and resisting arrest. Through the plea bargain Farris pleaded guilty to resisting arrest while all other charges were dropped. He was sentenced to seven years in prison.

In addition, Farris pleaded guilty to resisting arrest from an unrelated incident and was sentenced to three years in prison. The two sentences will run consecutive which will place Farris behind bars for 10 years.

The charge stems from an incident last year when Farris was wanted by police.

A probable cause statement filed in the case against Farris states that Hill had called police from a rest room in a convenience store in Aurora, telling them that Farris was a passenger in her car but that he would attempt to run if they tried to arrest him at that location.

She suggested an officer stop her car after she left the store. She said Farris was riding in the back seat and would not be able to get out because of child safety locks on the car.

When police conducted the traffic stop as it left the store on US 60, Farris climbed over seats to get out of the car and “the vehicle accelerated at a high rate of speed in reverse,” striking one of two arresting officers. A second officer fired on the vehicle, striking Hill as she sat in the driver’s seat. She later died from those injuries.

A second passenger in the car told officers that Farris ordered Hill to not to stop when police initiated the traffic stop and that he “was trying to push Hill’s leg down forcing it onto the accelerator and trying to get into the driver’s seat.”

Farris then tried to flee on foot but was apprehended.
