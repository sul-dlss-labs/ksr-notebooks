KRQE News 13 is learning more about the officer-involved shooting that left a man dead. Police say that man was also involved in the kidnapping of an Albuquerque Police dispatcher this summer.

Police say Anthony Chavez did not give up when officers cornered him at an apartment complex near Louisiana and Gibson last month.

Officers fired their guns after they say Chavez pointed his gun at them.

During a news conference Friday, police say it started after getting calls about a man who shot his gun in that apartment complex.

When they got to the scene, they found Chavez in the parking lot with the gun.

Police say Chavez did not shoot at the officers, but he did point his gun at them.

He died on scene.

APD says Chavez is the same man who was involved in the kidnapping of one of their dispatchers back in June.

“He was with other individuals who were involved in a pursuit with us, crashed that vehicle, and they barricaded themselves inside; actually one of our dispatcher’s houses, and she called back out, if you remember, with a 10-code saying I’m being held hostage,” said APD Officer Simon Drobik.

Also during Friday’s update, police gave more details on the officer involved shooting that injured a man last month in a neighborhood near Ladera and St. Josephs.

It started as a domestic dispute. When police go to the house, they found Anthony Juarez with a rifle.

Officers shot at Juarez after they say he refused to put down the gun and pointed it at them.

Juarez shot at officers 26 times before getting hit in the shoulder.

Thursday, Judge Richard Brown signed papers to release Juarez, but he’s still behind bars pending pre-trial services.

Police say they are frustrated with the judge’s decision.
