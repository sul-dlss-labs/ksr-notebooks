Cortland, N.Y. — A motorcyclist involved in a police pursuit with members of two law enforcement agencies was killed when the motorcycle he was riding crashed in the city of Cortland early Sunday morning, state police said.

Casey Stockton, 26, of Harford, was being chased by members of the Cortland Police Department and the Cortland County Sheriff’s Office at the time of the crash, according to Trooper Aga Dembinska, a state police spokesperson.

The motorcycle crashed near the Port Watson bridge in Cortland just before 1 a.m. Sunday, Dembinska said. The area was shut down for most of the morning so state police could investigate, she said.

Dembinska said state police had taken over the case but were not involved in the pursuit, so at this time were not releasing further details on the reason for the pursuit.

Officials from the two departments involved were not immediately available to comment.

The investigation is ongoing, Dembinska said.
