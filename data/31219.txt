HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — An armed suspect was shot and killed after an overnight SWAT standoff that went on for six hours in a northwest Houston neighborhood, according to the Harris County Sheriff's Office.

HCSO Maj. Susan Cotter said officers responded to multiple calls about 6:20 p.m. Saturday about a man armed with a 12-guage shotgun in the 11700 block of Moonglow Drive. Deputies were told the suspect was walking down the street and threatening people with the weapon, she said.

Investigators are awaiting a toxicology report to determine whether drugs were a factor. They said it doesn't seem the suspect fired his weapon at any residents.
