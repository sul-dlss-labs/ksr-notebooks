A 23-year-old South Carolina man died at a Shreveport hospital Wednesday afternoon, after reportedly running from sheriff's deputies at the scene of a traffic stop. Two Caddo Parish Sheriff's deputies stopped two vehicles with South Carolina tags Wednesday morning, eastbound on Interstate 20 in Shreveport. Two men were in each vehicle. Deputies say they received permission to search one of the vehicles and a K-9 alerted to possible drugs in the vehicle. At that point, deputies say two of the suspects ran into nearby woods. About 30 minutes later, deputies say they found 23-year-old Letim Harris of Columbia, SC under a tree - about a half mile from the scene of the traffic stop. Deputies say Harris told them he was hot and tired and could not run any longer. Paramedics transported Harris to a Shreveport hospital where he died several hours later. Sheriff Steve Prator called a news conference to address the death. Prator says there was no struggle involved and he believes Harris either had drugs in his system or simply died of natural causes. The sheriff says toxicology tests are being conducted to determine what, if anything, Harris had in his system.

Deputies say they recovered nearly a million dollars worth of marijuana ($896,000) in the vehicle that the dog alerted them to. The other vehicle did not contain drugs. The second man who fled, identified as 26-year-old Kenneth Davis of Columbia, SC is still at large. Police arrested the two men who did not flee: 22-year-old Johnathan Holley of Columbia, SC and 23-year-old Trenton Simpson of Chesnee, SC. Both were booked on charges of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess marijuana. Prator says the two suspects in custody told investigators they were returning from El Paso, Texas where they had purchased the marijuana with a "large amount of cash". Prator says he believes the men were attempting to return to South Carolina with the drugs.
