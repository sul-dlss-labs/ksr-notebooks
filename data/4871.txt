At no time did Officer Hernandez identify himself as a policeman, the official said, and one of the arriving officers, apparently believing the gunman was about to shoot the prone man, fired three times, striking Officer Hernandez in the abdomen and both thighs.

His police shield was found in his pocket.

A young man who said he was the person who had lain prone under the kneeling officer -- looking up into the barrel of his gun -- said after talking to the police that he had been mistaken by Officer Hernandez for one of the attackers and had been taken down when he offered to help. That young man and a friend said they did not hear arriving officers order Officer Hernandez to drop his gun before they shot him.

At St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, where Officer Hernandez was taken by ambulance and listed in extremely critical condition after four hours of surgery, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly described a tangle of events that ended in what both said was apparently a tragic accident.

"He had his shield in his pocket," the grim-faced mayor said of Officer Hernandez. He added: "The evidence is not clear that the officer that fired the bullets had any knowledge that he was a police officer. He was in plain clothes."

In a sketchy account of the predawn events, Commissioner Kelly said that the officer who shot Officer Hernandez "apparently thought that the officer was about to shoot another individual being held at gunpoint."
