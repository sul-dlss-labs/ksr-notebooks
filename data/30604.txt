STANDISH TWP, MI — A nearly 12-hour police standoff in Arenac County has ended in a murder-suicide.

About 4 a.m. on Thursday, July 15, sheriff’s deputies responded to a residence in the 2100 block of Whites Beach Road in Standish Township for a domestic violence situation, said Arenac County Sheriff James Mosciski.

Two adult males were inside the house, Mosciski said. Early on, deputies learned one of the two men was deceased while the other remained inside and would not come out.

“It wasn’t really a hostage situation,” the sheriff said. “We had a victim who was deceased and a gentleman, a suspect who was holding us off.”

A Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team and officers of the Saginaw-Chippewa Tribal Police Department also responded to the scene.

Around 3:30 p.m., the standoff ended with the suspect killing himself via a gunshot, Mosciski said.

The other deceased man apparently was killed by at least one stab wound, he added.

No other persons were injured.

The sheriff did not disclose the ages or names of either deceased man. He did not divulge which, if either, man lived at the residence where the standoff occurred.

Mosciski declined to describe the two men’s association. He did say the suspect had been involved in a police pursuit earlier in the week, but did not give additional details.

Deputies had blocked off traffic on area roads for several hours Thursday.

MSP Crime Lab personnel were processing the scene late Thursday afternoon.
