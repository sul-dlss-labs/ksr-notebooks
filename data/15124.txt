ANAHEIM – Authorities on Tuesday identified a Corona man who was killed in a shootout with police following an armed robbery at an electronics store.

Steen Parker III, 43, was the man killed by gunfire at the end of an hourlong standoff with officers on Friday afternoon in which he holed up in a vehicle at an auto lot in the 1300 block of North Tustin Avenue, according to the Orange County Coroner’s Office.

Police allege that Parker and another man – who they identified as Paul Brian Marval III, 39, of Lake Elsinore – robbed a Fry’s Electronics Store in the 3300 block of East La Palma Avenue at gunpoint shortly before 2 p.m. Friday.

As officers drove to the scene of the robbery, an SUV matching the description of the vehicle the robbers escaped in collided with a pickup near North Tustin and East Miraloma avenues. Two men were seen running from the vehicle, which police say had been stolen from the Corona area and was inoperable after the crash.

A California Highway Patrol officer in the area took Marval into custody, while police allege that Parker brandished a handgun at bystanders and attempted to hide at the auto lot on Tustin, north of Miraloma.

A police tactical response team spent about an hour trying to persuade Parker to come out of a vehicle he was hiding in and surrender, Anaheim police Lt. Bob Dunn said.

Shortly after 5:40 p.m., Dunn said Parker began firing at the officers “without warning.” Officers returned fire, police said, and Parker was struck and killed.

The Orange County District Attorney’s Office is investigating Parker’s death, as is routine for fatal shootings involving police officers.

Marval was arrested on suspicion of robbery, attempted burglary, possession of a stolen vehicle and a probation violation, police said. He is being held at the Central Men’s Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, according to Orange County Sheriff’s records.
