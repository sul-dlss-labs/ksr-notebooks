Gretna, La. - Gretna Police Chief Arthur Lawson says four or five of his officers were involved in a pursuit that ended with the deaths of two convicted felons.

According to Chief Lawson, it all began at 3:27 a.m. with an armed robbery at the Circle K at 929 Lafayette Street. Police say 21-year-old Tyre Leone of New Orleans walked into the store with a gun, demanded money and threatened the female cashier.

"At that point he demanded more money, continued with the weapon in the face of the victim in the convenience store, began counting down threatening to kill her," explained Chief Lawson.

When the suspect fled the scene, the cashier immediately called 911. In about one minute, police responded and spotted the suspect's vehicle.

A chase began on the Westbank Expressway with speeds exceeding 100 miles an hour. According to police, 25-year-old Terrence Ellis was behind the wheel of the 1996 Ford Thunderbird.

The chase ended in Marrero when the Thunderbird hit the guard rail. Police say Leone jumped from the vehicle with a semi-automatic handgun and started shooting at police.

"It all happened so quickly, that they were unable to even got out of their vehicle. So they shot from within their vehicle to return gunshots," explained Col. John Fortunato with the JPSO.

Terrence Ellis died from a single gunshot wound. Tyre Leone jumped from the expressway, falling 34 feet to his death. Chief Lawson says both men were convicted felons on probation or parole.

No officers were hurt. The JPSO is handling the investigation.
