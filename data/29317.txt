GREENFIELD, Ind. (WISH) — A man died Tuesday after being struck with a taser and falling during a chase with Greenfield police, Indiana State Police said.

The man was pronounced dead at a hospital, state police said.

Greenfield Police Chief Jeff Rasche requested that the Indiana State Police investigate the man’s death. That investigation was ongoing on Tuesday.
