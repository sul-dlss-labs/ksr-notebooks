Michael Cravey, a 28-year-old Gainesville man, was allegedly wielding a hatchet when officers found and opened fire on him, The Gainesville Sun reports.

Officers pursued the vehicle but were unsuccessful in catching him, according to HNGN. Cravey was allegedly running red lights and driving the wrong way on roads, and eventually crashed his car near a Best Buy parking lot.

A Gainesville Police Department officer saw the suspect, identified himself, and ordered Cravey to drop the hatchet in his hand, according to WCJB.

GPD spokesman Officer Ben Tobias said Cravey charged the officer with the hatchet raised above his head, leaving the officer no choice but to fire multiple rounds into the suspect, killing him.
