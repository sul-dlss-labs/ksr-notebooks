Drinking Water Warning



Boil Your Water Before Using

Due to a water main break in the Borough of Ashland, we are issuing this warning to boil your drinking water. After repairs have been made, we will chlorinate and flush the system. The affected area includes all customers of the Ashland Area Municipal Authority. Bacterial contamination can occur due to breaks in the distribution system (pipes). We will inform you when tests show no bacteria and you no longer have to boil your water.

What should I do?

DO NOT DRINK THE WATER WITHOUT BOILING IT FIRST.

Bring all water to a boil for one minute, and let it cool before using, or use bottled water. Boiled or bottled water should be used for drinking, making ice, brushing teeth, washing dishes, and food preparation UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE. Boiling kills bacteria and

other organisms in the water.
