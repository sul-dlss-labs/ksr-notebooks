Meet the DA

I am the District Attorney for the Twenty-First Judicial District, Colorado. In 1996, I began as a Deputy District Attorney in Mesa County, Colorado. Other than a short period from 2002 to 2005, I have spent my career as a prosecutor in this office, including being the Chief Deputy District Attorney over the Drug division, and the Crime Against Children Division. On October 16, 2015, I was appointed District Attorney and remain in that role today.

The Colorado District Attorney's Council recognized me as the Colorado Prosecutor of the Year for 2009, and I am the current President of the Colorado District Attorney's Council. I have been appointed or elected to serve on several boards or committees by the Governor of Colorado, the Attorney General of Colorado, and local groups. I have chaired the Community Corrections Board, am on the Mesa County Drug Threat Oversight Committee, the State Meth Task Force, and the District Attorney's Legislative Committee and Governing Board and am the current Secretary of the Board, and the Colorado Commission of Criminal and Juvenile Justice Sentencing Task Force. I am also a statewide trainer in all areas of criminal law, and assist in crafting and drafting legislation which promotes public safety.

It is my honor and privilege to serve the citizens of Mesa County, and to be the lawyer for each and every one of them, fighting for justice.
