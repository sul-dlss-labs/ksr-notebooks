Escambia County Judge Pat Kinsey is in trouble again.

This time, she botched the case of 22-year-old Curtis Ross III, community leaders and legal observers say.

The black, learning disabled man spent seven weeks in jail thanks to Kinsey, who threw him behind bars April 30 to begin serving 12 years for allegedly writing 12 worthless checks. She imposed the jail term, despite a Florida Highway Patrol investigator reporting to the judge that Ross was the victim of identity theft and despite a public defender raising the question about Ross’ mental competency.

Ross spent seven weeks in jail, before the local civil rights group Movement For Change focused attention on the injustice.

Ever since, the case has ignited a firestorm in the legal and black communities. The Pensacola Voice, a black weekly newspaper, devoted half of its front page to the story in its July 7 issue.

Leroy Boyd, speaking on behalf of the Ross family for this story, finds Kinsey guilty of being a bad judge.

“She had the information in front of her,” the Movement For Change president says. “She didn’t show compassion for the mentally handicapped. She didn’t show concern for justice. Instead, it was lock him up at almost any cost. She’s not suited to be a judge.”

JUST THE FACTS

Despite Kinsey’s recent claims that she didn’t know about the identity theft or learning disability, Earl D. Loveless says letters from the State Attorney’s Office and FHP, a motion by Ross’ attorney Patrece Cashwell and court transcripts all show otherwise.

“Contrary what she stated in court that evidence, as well as the competency issue, was brought to her several weeks earlier in court,” says the 28-year public defender. “I believe the judge made a decision that was incorrect. And she made a decision that she did not have to make and should not have made.”

It’s not the first time that Kinsey finds herself in the hot seat on the bench. In December, the Florida Supreme Court reprimanded Kinsey and imposed a $50,000 fineâ€”one of the stiffest penalties for violations of judicial conduct in state history. The seven Florida justices found Kinsey misrepresented then-incumbent Escambia County Judge William Green’s record and went overboard in presenting herself as a pro-law enforcement judge in flyers and on radio shows during her 1998 political campaign.

In fact, one flyer shows the former assistant state attorney posing with 10-gun toting, menacing S.W.A.T. members dressed in black. A caption on the grainy black and white photo asks, “Who do these guys count on to back them up?”

Kinsey maintains during a June 29 hearing that she didn’t know about Ross’ learning disability, which prevented him from ever opening a checking account and led him to lose his job at a fast-food restaurant because he couldn’t read the orders.

Instead, she blames Public Defender Juan Moreno for ineffective assistance, even though, the state prosecutor and her defense attorney, who took over Ross’ case in May, point to the new evidence brought by the FHP. They also note the fact that Ross did not understand the charges Oct. 29, when he originally pleaded no contest to the worthless checks.

Although she allowed Ross to withdraw his plea June 29, Kinsey ordered Ross to undergo a psychological evaluation and to return to court Sept. 8.

KINSEY QUESTIONED

In a June 23 transcript of a meeting in her chambers with Assistant State Attorney John Simon and Cashwell, Kinsey says she “would not tolerate anyone indicting the mentally retarded.” She also alludes to ineffective assistance saying, “I don’t think we would be here, if the previous council had informed us of these things.”

Kinsey could not be reached for comment but she tells The Pensacola Voice, “I do a lot of homework. I don’t think of people with preconceived ideas. My goal is to always treat everybody with dignity and respect.”

Cashwell disputes Kinsey’s version of events. She points out that court transcripts show Moreno did raise the competency and victim ID theft on April 30 before Kinsey sentenced Ross to 12 yearsâ€”one year for each worthless check.

“Frankly, Judge Kinsey, once the two issues were brought to her attention, should have stopped the proceeding at that point and did what needed to be done,” Cashwell says. “She made a mistake. But she did in the end rectify that mistake.”

Cashwell and Loveless both defend Moreno’s defense of Ross, pointing out he never showed up to talk about his case to the assistant public defender before or after he plead no contest on Oct. 29.

“He doesn’t understand what happened or why,” Cashwell says of her 22-year-old client. “What he does understand is part of the blame lies with him. Curtis doesn’t like to admit he suffers mental deficiencies.”

Loveless, the chief assistant in the Public Defender’s Office, adds: “Quite frankly, there was no reasonable way for Mr. Moreno or any attorney to know he was incompetent or didn’t understand what he was saying. This man apparently is retarded but it’s a condition that’s not easy to discover.”

KINSEY VS. ROSS

Ross still tried to stand up to Kinsey before being sentenced to jail April 30. At the court hearing, FHP investigator Lt. Sonya Karasek’s April 9 letter was brought up. Karasek writes that her investigation found that Broderick Cooper obtained a driver’s license in Ross’ name and opened a checking account at Sun Trust Bank. An ATM surveillance camera captures Cooper making a transaction in Ross’ name and a bank manager identifies Cooper as Ross, the investigator reports.

But Kinsey lays into Ross during the April 30 hearing: “What’s going on here?”

Ross: “Nothing really.”

Kinsey: “Nothing really. Well, that’s what I see, nothing really.”

Ross: “I’m trying to get everything closed up soâ€”I didn’t write the checks. The dude stole my ID and Social Security cards.”

Kinsey: “Well, why did you take responsibility for them?”

Ross: “I didn’t.”

Kinsey: “Oh yes sir, you didâ€¦Well, you know, I don’t see anything I can do right here, right now at this time.”

Kinsey ends the hearing by sentencing Ross to 12 years and saying, “He’s had six months to investigate thisâ€¦right now you’re going to have to start the timeâ€¦You entered the plea, you had counsel and we don’t go back and second guess six months later, OK.”

Loveless contends that Kinsey’s April 30 sentence was illegal. That’s because Judge Kinsey imposed the conditions. She did not impose the jail sentence and then suspend it, if he met the conditions, Loveless explains.

Already Escambia County Circuit Judge Frank Bell overruled one of her decisions because of an improperly made sentence. Another similar case is currently being appealed.

BAD PRESS

Besides criticizing Kinsey, Cashwell, Loveless, Assistant State Attorney Tiffany Sims and others blast the Pensacola News Journal for portraying Kinsey favorably by failing to get the facts straight in June 25 and June 30 articles on the case.

Criminal defense attorney Mike Rollo sent a letter correcting the record to all the media outlets. Only the Independent News ran the letter. The News Journal has yet to run a correction.

“It’s disturbing because the information they got, I gave to them,” Loveless says.

Cashwell plastered handwritten notes throughout the judicial building saying the PNJ “misrepresented the truth” when it wrongly reported that she filed a motion alleging ineffective assistance by Moreno.

“If someone was guilty of ineffective counsel, I would put it in a motion,” she says. “I have no problem firing the gun. I believe you have to tell the truth at the end of the day. (The PNJ) refuses to correct its story.”

Meanwhile the case is still pending. Boyd says Ross is fearful of returning to jail.

“I’ve talked to him and he’ll be happy when it’s all over,” Boyd says.

Loveless says he doesn’t understand why Kinsey, who faces reelection this year and has drawn opposition from Clint Couch, won’t drop the case. Couch declines to comment on Ross’ case, since it’s still under investigation.

“There isn’t any reason for taxpayers to pay hundreds of dollars for an evaluation by the state,” Loveless says. “All charges ought to be dropped. He shouldn’t have served time in the first place.”

Boyd vows to work to defeat Kinsey in November. He also points to the Ronald Walker case. Kinsey ordered the terminally ill man, who was in Hospice care, to be taken into custody. Court records show that doctors and Walker’s wife, Rena, alerted Kinsey to his condition back in 2002. The judge later dismissed the charges.

“If worthless checks are worth 12 years in jail then she should be serving life in prison for her judicial code violations, instead of paying a $50,000 fine,” Boyd says. “She has shown she does not have the temperament to be a judge. I’ll be very disappointed if our majority community continues to support her. She’s part of the problem.”
