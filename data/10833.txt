Oklahoma City Police released the name of the man who shot three police officers before being killed Thursday night outside the Valley Brook Municipal Building.

Around 10:45 p.m. on December 8, Oklahoma City Police received a call for assistance from the Valley Brook Police Department. The small department, which consists of only six officers, reported a man was attempting to break into the City Hall building, which is attached to the police department in the 1600 block of S.E. 59th Street. That's just east of Crossroads Mall.

Police say 36-year-old Damien Jefferson Muncie broke into the building and ransacked the offices. When police arrived, they confronted Muncie on the east side of the building and tried to arrest him. Oklahoma City Police say that's when Muncie shot three officers.

Valley Brook Officer D. Johnson, and Oklahoma city officers Chris Grimes and Roy Mitchell were wounded. Police returned fire and killed Muncie.

At some point, Muncie wrote in blood on the outside of the building. Police aren't saying if Muncie used his own blood at some point before the shooting. Investigators are still trying to determine exactly what happened.

" There's some damage to some east side of the building. There's a window that's busted out," said Oklahoma City Police Capt. Dexter Nelson. "We're not sure exactly if the suspect was breaking into the building or what exactly was going on, but when they got here he did confront them with a firearm."

All three police officers received non-life threatening wounds. They were treated and released from hospitals Friday morning. The Oklahoma City police officers are on routine administrative leave while the shooting is being investigated.



The Oklahoma City Police Department's Homicide Unit and the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation are investigating the shooting.
