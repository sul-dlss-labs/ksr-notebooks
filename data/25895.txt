Deputies responding to a domestic disturbance Friday night in Buckeye fatally shot a man who threw a large wrench at them and then approached with a hammer.

The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office got a 911 call shortly before midnight about the disturbance near 209th Avenue and Narramore Road, in the Rainbow Valley area, according to a Sheriff's Office news release.

At the location, deputies made contact with a man identified as 39-year-old Juan Torres in the backyard of a home. He threw a large wrench and struck one of the deputies, according to the release.

Torres then approached deputies with a hammer, and both deputies fired their guns and shot Torres, the release stated.

Torres was taken to a hospital, where he died, the release said.

The investigation is ongoing, sheriff's officials said.
