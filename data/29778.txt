One person was killed Wednesday evening in a single-vehicle crash after leading Mansfield police on a high-speed chase that ended north of Shelby.

Three Mansfield police officers — Sgt. Toneli Webb, Cameron Shepherd and Carson Frase — have been placed on administrative leave, per department policy, pending the outcome of an investigation.

The driver killed in the crash was identified as Randy Heater, 37, of Mansfield, according to a news release Thursday morning from the Ohio Highway Patrol.

The incident began at 8:21 p.m. Wednesday when Mansfield police responded to a report of three men fighting, with a woman potentially being held against her will, in the area of 251 Sycamore St., according to a news release.

While en route, officers learned a man had been struck in the face with a tire iron and a possible suspect had fled the area in a pickup.

Police found the 2005 Chevy Silverado pickup on Bowman Street, traveling north at a "high rate of speed." The driver refused to stop, the release said.

While in pursuit, Heater traveled off the road and "rammed" a police cruiser, according to the release.

Leading police through rural Richland County, the driver ultimately crashed on Plymouth Springmill Road, north of London East Road, and was pronounced dead at the scene, the patrol said.

"When they got up to the S-curve, the driver lost control, dropped off the right side of the road, struck a guardrail, overturned several times and ejected," said Sgt. Tyler Carr of the Ohio Highway Patrol at the scene of the crash.

Heater was not wearing a seatbelt, the patrol said.

The highway patrol was assisted by the Mansfield Police Department, Shelby Police Department, Richland County Sheriff’s Office, Shelby Fire Department, Shiloh Fire Department, and the Richland County Coroner's Office.

The crash remains under investigation, the patrol said.
