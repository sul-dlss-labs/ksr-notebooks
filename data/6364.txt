Goshen resident Terrell Williamson killed in weekend accident in Dothan Published 12:00 am Saturday, July 28, 2007

James Terrell Williamson, 66, was driving through Dothan this past Saturday, July 21, when a truck that was speeding away from police cars struck his vehicle.

Williamson, a resident of Goshen, was killed in the accident.

Phillip Lutz, 19, of Maylene has been charged with murder in Williamson's death, according to The Associated Press. He is being held without bond in the Houston County jail.

The Troy Messenger reported that the car chase began in Jackson County, Fla., after a sheriff's deputy noticed Lutz's Ford Ranger speeding away from a convenience store around 11 a.m.

Lutz was then chased by the Florida authorities until he crossed into Alabama, where Dothan Police and Houston County Sheriff's deputies took over the pursuit.

Lutz then collided with Williamson's vehicle at the intersection of Saunders Road and Cottonwood Road in Dothan.

Both opened and closed containers of alcohol were found in Lutz's truck.

The Troy Messenger reported that Williamson had worked for many years at Troy Auto Parts.

Pike County Sheriff Russell Thomas, also a Goshen resident, said he'd known Williamson for many years.

“He was a good man and an easy-going person,” Thomas said. “They are a good family, and we are all saddened by this.”

He is survived by his wife, two sons, five grandchildren, three sisters, a brother and his mother.
