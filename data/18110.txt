William Charbonneau had a black shotgun in the backyard of his Avalon Park home when deputies encountered him Wednesday night — a day before his 44th birthday.

A family member led the Orange County sheriff’s deputies to the quaint white home on Marsh Lilly Drive, saying Charbonneau was planning to kill himself.

He had a history of suicide attempts, the Sheriff’s Office said.

Deputy Richard Nye, a nearly nine-year veteran on the force, caught the family member speeding and driving recklessly on the way to check on Charbonneau.

When Nye and other two deputies got there, Charbonneau denied multiple commands, leaving Nye no choice but to open fire, sheriff’s officials said.

Charbonneau died at Florida Hospital East.

The Sheriff’s Office said Nye first spotted Charbonneau’s family member just after 9:30 p.m. driving toward the house in southeast Orange County. Nye stopped the family member, who explained he or she needed to check on the 43-year-old.

Nye and the other deputies, Nathan Alequin and trainee Kathleen Perez-Thomas, then followed.

When they got to Charbonneau’s home, they called out for him, but didn’t get a response. Deputies quickly searched the 2,200-square-foot house and found Charbonneau in the backyard with the gun.

A spokesperson for Aetna Specialty Pharmacy confirmed on Thursday that Charbonneau was recently an employee at the health care company. Details about his employment weren’t released, and the company, which has a facility in Orlando, did not comment on his death. Florida Department of Health Records show Charbonneau had an active pharmacist license, which he first received in 1998.

None of the deputies involved were injured. All three were put on administrative leave, which is protocol after an officer-involved shooting.
