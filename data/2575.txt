A man died yesterday after falling from a fourth-floor apartment in Upper Manhattan that the police were investigating for drugs, the authorities said. About 4:15 p.m., an officer at 470 West 150th Street in Sugar Hill saw a man leave and re-enter an apartment that the police said was a known drug location. As the officer arrested the man, Andres Abando, 37, another man in the apartment fled through a rear window. That man, Juan Carlos Sanchez Vasquez, 30, of Manhattan, was pronounced dead at the scene. The police said they found drugs and paraphernalia at the apartment. Mr. Abando was charged with criminal possession of a controlled substance. Tina Kelley (NYT)
