Police have identified the suspect and victims in an early morning pursuit that ended in a deadly crash in downtown Topeka on Tuesday.

According to the Topeka Police Dept., an officer tried to stop a vehicle at the NW St. John and Kansas Ave. intersection around 5:00 a.m. The driver, whom they identified as 62-year-old Sherman N. Jenkins, reportedly took off and led police on a "low-speed chase" through north Topeka.

After taking the Kansas Ave. Bridge across the river, police used spike strips to flatten his tires. Jenkins' vehicle then struck two cars in the intersection of 6th St. and Topeka Blvd., police say. The wreck shut down the intersection until 1:00 p.m.

The driver of the first car that was hit was identified as 28-year-old Danny Williams Jr.

Jenkins was also taken to a local hospital. TPD expects him to be booked on Murder in the first degree, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, 2 counts of Aggravated Battery, Driving with a revoked license and other traffic violations.
