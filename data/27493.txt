A man was killed Tuesday in a trooper-involved shooting after he barricaded himself inside a home in Allen, Oklahoma.

According to the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, Shawn Michael Taylor, 33, fled into the home on South 4th Street after leading local police on a pursuit around 11 a.m. when he threatened to shoot officers.

When an OHP tactical team arrived about an hour later at the request of Allen Police, they made contact with Taylor, but he refused to reply with requests.

OHP said during the incident Taylor pointed a long gun at officers, and a member of the tactical team opened fire, striking Taylor. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

OHP said the trooper who fired the shots will be placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.
