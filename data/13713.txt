Wayne Courtright, a 59-year-old former St. Helena man, was shot and killed in Guerneville on Monday after reportedly firing shots at Sonoma County sheriff’s deputies.

According to the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office, police responded to the Riverlane Resort in Guerneville after the resort’s manager, Benita Courtright, reported that her husband was threatening to kill her. The couple lived at the resort.

Benita Courtright and her 30-year-old daughter left the property and went to a police substation, where she told police her husband was intoxicated, suicidal and armed with a rifle.

Deputies formed a perimeter around the property’s main house, and about 20 minutes after they arrived they reported that shots were being fired inside the house, according to police. At about midnight, Courtright exited the front of the house armed with a high-powered rifle and started shooting at deputies, police said.

Deputies returned fire and Courtright went down, having been shot at least once, police said. Police haven’t determined whether any of his wounds were self-inflicted.

Medical personnel attended to Courtright, who died at the scene. In accordance with protocol, the Petaluma Police Department and Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office are conducting an investigation of the shooting, and the deputies who were involved have been placed on administrative leave.

For about seven years the Courtrights lived on a Spring Mountain Road property owned by Jo Ann Popplewell.

Wayne Courtright managed some rental properties owned by Popplewell. The couple moved to Guerneville about a year ago when Benita Courtright got a job managing the Riverlane Resort, Popplewell said.

“He was a wonderfully mild-mannered person, absolutely a great guy,” Popplewell said. “I cannot imagine what in the world happened. He was excellent with my renters. He was very religious and very mild."
