The suspect in a police shooting this week was determined to have died by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the Knox County Sheriff's Office.

Jacob Lane Morgan, 21, died during an encounter with Knoxville Police Department officers on Lowe Road near Broadway on Thursday evening.

According to KCSO, which investigated the incident per an agreement between the agencies, KPD officers were investigating a shooting from Dec. 16 that had multiple victims when they spotted a vehicle that they believed belonged to one of the suspects.

The vehicle, a newer model Toyota Tacoma, was reported to be at a house on Lowe Road. Officers determined that the truck's tags were registered to Morgan. After a failed traffic stop, the truck was found in the parking lot of a restaurant adjacent to the house.

When officers went to the home to serve three warrants for aggravated assault from the Dec. 16 shooting, there was an exchange of gunfire, according to KCSO.

KCSO reported Morgan's death was caused by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to the medical examiner.

An investigation into the shooting is still being led by KCSO, and further updates are expected to come as information emerges.

A previous version of this report misidentified Jacob Lane Morgan's city of residence. Official records list Morgan as homeless.
