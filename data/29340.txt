State police are investigating the death of a woman authorities say shot herself while sitting alone in a police car.

The woman was sitting in the police car while officers were investigating a Grant County traffic accident in which she was believed to be the passenger.

The investigation was requested by the Grant County Sheriff’s Department, according to a statement from the Indiana State Police, which identified the victim as Amanda Elbert, 32, of Alexandria.

The incident in which Elbert died began about 8:15 a.m. Saturday, when officers from the Gas City Police Department, the Upland Police Department and the Grant County Sheriff’s Department responded to a single vehicle crash near 4598 South County Road 600 East, according to the ISP statement. The site is about 14 miles northwest of Marion.

Preliminary investigation by Indiana State Police Detective Wendell Beachy revealed that when officers arrived at the crash scene, they found a 2007 Chevrolet Impala that crashed into a utility pole. Officers found Elbert in the passenger seat, but the driver had allegedly fled the scene on foot.

Elbert, who indicated she was not injured in the crash, according to the ISP statement, was placed in the cruiser of an Upland Police officer to stay warm while the investigation was conducted.

As officers were taking an inventory of the Chevrolet in preparation for it to be towed from the scene, they heard a gunshot, according to the ISP statement. It said Elbert allegedly shot herself with a handgun she had retrieved from her purse.

Medics were summoned to the scene, and Elbert was pronounced dead.

The investigation is ongoing.
