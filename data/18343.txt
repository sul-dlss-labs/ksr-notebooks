A Rochester police officer was justified in using deadly force when he shot a rural Lanesboro man armed with a pellet gun, according to the review of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigation by the Mower County Attorney’s office.

On Oct. 23, 2016, Sgt. Steve Thompson shot and killed Kristofer Daniel Youngquist, 45, during an armed standoff at Youngquist’s rural Lanesboro residence.

According to police accounts of the incident, Youngquest was sought in connection with an earlier domestic assault. When police arrived at his residence, he refused to cooperate and retreated into his residence.

Because he had a prior history of violent behavior and was known to have access to weapons, local authorities requested assistance from the Rochester Police Department’s tactical squad. Law enforcement negotiated with Youngquist for more than three hours, during which time he was seen be in possession of what appeared to be a rifle, but was later determined to be a pellet gun.

When Youngquist leveled the weapon at police, Thompson fired, killing Youngquist.
