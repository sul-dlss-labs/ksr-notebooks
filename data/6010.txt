Arnold resident Clarence Leroy Johnson Jr. would have turned 39 on Saturday but died in a shootout with police Wednesday.

Anne County Police identified him Thursday as the man who engaged them in a shootout in a quiet Severna Park neighborhood after robbing a bank on Baltimore Annapolis Boulevard.

Anne Arundel County police Officer Doyle Holquist, 32, was shot in the upper leg.

It?s unclear which of two officers killed Johnson, but he was struck "multiple times" when police returned fire, a spokesman said.

An Anne Arundel County homicide detective will be investigating Johnson?s death, Lt. David Waltemeyer said, adding that the State?s Attorney?s Office will make the final determination on whether the officers acted properly.

"At this point, we believe it was a justifiable use of force," Waltemeyer said.

Holquist and the other officer involved in the shooting were placed on administrative leave with pay, Waltemeyer said. Two other officers involved in Wednesday?s incident were also placed on administrative leave with pay.

Johnson?s death represents the first police-involved shooting death in 2007, according to agency records. Last year, Anne Arundel police shot six people, three of whom were killed. There was one police-involved shooting, which resulted in a fatality, in 2005.

Maryland court records do not indicate that Johnson was a violent person. He was found notguilty of assault and false imprisonment in 2003, and received probation for a drinking and driving charge in 2005.
