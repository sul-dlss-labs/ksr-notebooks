A Montgomery County grand jury this week cleared six police officers of any wrongdoing for the fatal shooting of a bank robber during a dramatic hostage standoff broadcast by news media nationwide in January.

The grand jurors determined the officers’ use of force in the Jan. 28 incident was justified. The six fired at the robber as he chased a hostage and pointed his gun at her back. The robber, Carlos Rudolfo Espinoza Arcia, 43, was killed. The hostage, a bank teller who was taken out of the bank by Arcia at gunpoint, survived.

The three Takoma Park officers who fired their guns — acting Lt. Tyrone Collington, Cpl. Thomas E. Black and Pfc. David M. Quante — returned to work Friday, officials said.

Takoma Park Police Chief Ronald A. Ricucci said there were 11 Takoma Park officers on the scene. Those who fired had to account for the location of the hostage and other officers. “They avoided crossfire. They had the proper shots to take,” Ricucci said.

The three officers from the Prince George’s County Police Department who also fired their guns — acting Sgt. Robbie Loveday, Cpl. Bryan Medina and police officer Osiris Lopez Jr. — are expected to return to full duty in the coming weeks, officials said.

“This was an unfortunate and dangerous situation our officers were placed in,” said Prince George’s acting Police Chief Mark Magaw.

On the morning of Jan. 28, Arcia walked into the Capital One Bank in Takoma Park and pulled out a 9mm handgun.

Police were called to the bank and responded within minutes. Arcia eventually exited the bank holding a gun to the head of the teller. As he tried to back away from the officers, he slipped, allowing the hostage to break free and run. Arcia pursued her with his gun pointed at her, and police shot him.
