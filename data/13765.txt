STRASBURG, Colo. (CBS4) â€” Deputies shot and killed a suspect who witnesses say was carrying a shotgun. It happened near Rookies Saloon on North Monroe Street in Strasburg, which is a local hang out.

Wednesday night when a man from out-of-town stopped in, people say everyone knew something about him wasn't quite right.

"It's too bad he got shot and killed, but it's Thanksgiving. I'm fortunate I'm alive," said John Powell.

Powell really counts his blessings this Thanksgiving. Wednesday he said a strange man, identified as Scott Pfeffer, 48, of Agate, came into his usual hang out.

"He was a little more than friendly, making hints of killing people and talking about owning a shotgun," Powell said. "Everybody in the bar had a problem with him. Everybody tried to stay away from him."

Powell said he got a bad feeling and left. Shortly after owner Barb Valley said the man snapped.

"He left and came back with a gun. At that time the doors were locked and the police had been called," Valley said.

The Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office called for backup from Adams County. When deputies arrived things started to escalate across the road at the KOA Campground where deputies said Pfeffer was staying.

"As deputies were pursuing him on foot he turned around and pointed the shotgun at the deputies. The deputies fired at the suspect and he was deceased on scene," Louie Perea with the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office said.

Investigators still don't know the Pfeffer's motive, but Powell said that he's thankful.

"I guess I kind of took what he said for granted because there are a lot of loons out there. It's kind of creepy to think about. I'm happy I left," Powell said.

Deputies impounded the Pfeffer's pickup truck from a KOA Campground.
