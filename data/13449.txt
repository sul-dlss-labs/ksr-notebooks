TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - Police say a man has died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound following an officer-involved shooting and vehicle pursuit in San Tan Valley.

A woman called police on September 24 to say her husband forced entry into her residence, despite the Order of Protection she said she had on him.

Police said her husband, 34-year-old Arciano Corona, broke windows and threatened her with a gun at the scene in the 34000 block of N. Jackpot Street around 2:15 p.m.

Corona stood by a Dodge Dakota truck when a deputy arrived on scene. Corona pointed a sawed off shotgun at the deputy and fired, according to a news release.

Corona drove away in his vehicle and a pursuit was initiated. Police said Corona hit a parked car and kept shooting at deputies, which prompted a Pinal County Sheriff's Deputy to fire a round back to keep him from shooting.

Corona drove into a nearby desert area and stopped. He did not respond to police when asked to surrender. Deputies approached the vehicle and saw Corona appeared to have a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head and he was pronounced dead at the scene.

No deputies reported injuries.

Investigators determined Corona had arrest warrants for probation violations from a prior aggravated assault charge and failure to appear on an aggravated assault domestic violence case.
