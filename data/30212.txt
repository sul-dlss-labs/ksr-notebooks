Ryan Daniel Gonzalez, a 26-year-old Latino man, was shot by an off-duty deputy U.S. marshal behind 7315 Melrose Ave. in Hollywood just before midnight Wednesday, March 5.

According to police, the marshal was arguing with his wife in an alley near the intersection of Poinsettia Street and Melrose Avenue when Gonzalez intervened. After arguing with the marshal, Gonzalez allegedly brandished a gun at him. Police said Gonzalez then grabbed the marshal and began punching him in the head several times.

The marshal broke free and identified himself as a law enforcement officer, but Gonzalez allegedly continued to point the gun at him. Fearing for his life, the marshal pulled out a sidearm and fired several shots. Gonzalez was hit multiple times and was taken to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:26 a.m. the next day.

The marshal, whose name was withheld pending an investigation, was later arrested on suspicion of domestic battery.
