KNOXVILLE — The robbery suspect shot by deputies Friday morning has died.

At least two shots were fired Friday after officers stopped the man, who was on parole for murder and wanted in last month’s stabbing at the Farragut Market.

He was pronounced dead at the University of Tennessee Medical Center on Friday afternoon, officials said.

Knox County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Martha Dooley said officers had seen Elijah Chase Jackson, 33, in the Powell area and had been following him.

At least three officers stopped the gold SUV that Jackson was driving at the intersection of East Beaver Creek Drive and Mountain Mist Lane about 10:30 a.m.

Dooley said while Jackson initially stopped the SUV, he then rammed at least three Sheriff’s Office vehicles and barreled into Clearview subdivison on Mountain Mist Lane.

Dooley said Jackson drove to the end of the drive and then through the back yard of a home where he was cornered and could go no farther.

“They said he ran out of real estate,” Dooley said.

Officers fired repeated shots at Jackson after he rammed the vehicles and attempted to run over them, Dooley said.

All the shots were fired on East Beaver Creek Drive.

Authorities are questioning a woman who was in the SUV with Jackson, Dooley said.

Authorities had sought Jackson since he was accused of the Aug. 16 stabbing of John Scoggins, 46, of Hughlan Drive, about 8 a.m. at the Farragut Market.

Jackson, of Concord Woods Drive, would have faced charges of aggravated assault and violation of probation.

Scoggins, who was stabbed in the leg, told detectives he was in the parking lot when he encountered the apparently intoxicated Jackson, authorities said.

Scoggins said Jackson made an obscene comment to him, but Scoggins opted to walk away.

Scoggins said Jackson approached him from behind and punched him in the head. A scuffle erupted with the two men exchanging blows, according to the Sheriff’s Office.

“Jackson went to his car and came back with a knife and stabbed Scoggins once in the leg,” according to the Sheriff’s Office.

Jackson apparently wasn’t finished with the assault, but Farragut Market clerk Norman Chobot, 68, “came out of the store armed with a pistol and ordered Jackson to back away from the victim,” according to the Sheriff’s Office.

Jackson fled in a silver, four-door Mitsubishi, as Chobot fired three rounds trying to hit the tires. Authorities later recovered the car.

Jackson in 2002 pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 20 years’ imprisonment, according to court records.

Jackson and four other men were accused of the 6 a.m. Sept. 26, 1999, slaying of Keith S. Jackson, 30, in the parking lot of a McCalla Avenue pool hall. There is no relation between Elijah and Keith Jackson.

The group of men robbed Keith Jackson and his friend after a night of celebrating the friend’s birthday, police said. Keith Jackson was a New Jersey resident who had been in Knoxville a few months.

Keith Jackson and his friend surrendered their belongings to the group of robbers. When Keith Jackson refused to relinquish an item that had sentimental value, he was killed with a shotgun blast to the head.
