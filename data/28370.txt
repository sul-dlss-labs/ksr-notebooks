A Sandy police officer who shot and killed a Tualatin man experiencing a mental health crisis also shot and injured a Clackamas County sheriff’s deputy during an attempted arrest in Welches, the sheriff’s office said Thursday.

Sandy Police Officer Michael Boyes shot and killed Doug Diamond, 58, after police and deputies responded to a report about an armed and suicidal person at the Mt. Hood Village RV Resort.

Hours after the shooting, the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office reported Diamond had shot Collinson. Now, the sheriff’s office says that Diamond never fired his gun.

The shooting occurred after officers arrived to the RV park and found Diamond outside of his RV. Deputies and a crisis negotiator tried to talk to Diamond for several minutes.

Family members told the sheriff’s office at the time that Diamond was going through a mental health crisis.

According to the Clackamas County Sheriff’s Office, Diamond refused to comply with orders. They used a less-than-lethal shotgun and a stun gun, but neither subdued Diamond. When officers tried to arrest Diamond, he then took out a handgun and pointed it at Clackamas County Sgt. Sean Collinson, according to the sheriff’s office. Then, Boyes fired at Diamond. The bullets struck and killed Diamond and hit Collinson in the arm and finger.

The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to questions about why officers used less-than-lethal rounds and a stun gun on Diamond before he had taken out a weapon. They said they had reported Diamond had fired his gun “based on information initially available from the scene.”
