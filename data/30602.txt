NORFOLK, Va. - At least two people have been detained after leading Chesapeake Police on a chase that ended in a crash that killed two people early Thursday evening.

Around 6:07 p.m., a Chesapeake Police officer was driving on I-64 westbound just before the Greenbrier Parkway exit when a dark-colored, two-door coupe sped past the officer and took the southbound Greenbrier Parkway exit.

The officer activated his emergency equipment and tried to stop the driver of the vehicle for reckless driving. The suspect ignored the police lights and siren and continued southbound on Greenbrier Parkway, making evasive movements as it continued.

As the suspect came to the intersection of Greenbrier Parkway and Crossways Boulevard, they made a sharp right turn onto Crossways Boulevard. The driver continued ignoring and evading the officer.

The driver then sped through the intersection of Crossways Boulevard and Jarman Road, where they hit a four-door Honda sedan in the intersection.

The driver of the vehicle Seymore struck was killed on impact, and the vehicle's passenger died at the hospital, police said. The victims have been identified as 65-year-old David Jones and 54-year-old Jennifer O'Connell, both from Chesapeake.

Responding officers detained the suspects at the scene for questioning. As of now, no one has been formally charged.

News 3 spoke with the aunt of the suspect in the two-door coupe. She said it was her 23-year-old nephew and that he was the only person in the car. She also said he has PTSD and has had a phobia of the police since he was a child, which is why she thinks he was speeding and didn't pull over.

The Chesapeake Police Crash Reconstruction Team and Criminal Investigations responded to the incident, which is under investigation.
