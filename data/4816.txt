A Zion murder suspect was fatally shot late Tuesday by police after he pointed a gun at them in a Springfield apartment, authorities said.

Jarrell Schofield, 21, who had lived in the 2700 block of Gilead Avenue, was wanted on first-degree murder charges in the Oct. 1 shooting of Willie White, 42, in his garage in Zion, authorities said.

Authorities were unable to find Schofield until Tuesday, when Springfield police got a tip that he was in a first-floor apartment in the 600 block of West Capitol Avenue.

Springfield police, aware of the arrest warrant for Schofield, had information that he was armed and dangerous and got a warrant that allowed them to kick in the door without warning, said Sgt. Kevin Keen. When police entered the apartment, Schofield confronted officers with a weapon drawn, Keen said.

It is unclear whether Schofield shot at police before they fatally wounded him, Keen said. No police officers were injured, he said. State police are investigating the shooting to determine whether it was justifiable, Keen said.

Schofield was the son of White's former live-in girlfriend, Zion police have said. He had a history of problems with White, police said.
