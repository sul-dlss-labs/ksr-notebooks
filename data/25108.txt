A suspect in the murder of a woman found dead in her Leeds home early Monday morning has taken his own life.

It all began about 7:30 a.m. when St. Clair County authorities received a call from a concerned citizen. Assistant Sheriff Billy Murray said the caller reported a possible shooting at 252 Trails End Lane in Leeds.

Once on the scene, lawmen found 36-year-old Barbara Posey dead inside the residence. St. Clair County investigators, Moody police and Jacksonville State Forensics responded to the home.

After an extensive investigation, St. Clair County investigators issued an arrest warrant for her boyfriend George Darrell Heath, 39. The two lived together and shared children, though the children were not home at the time of the shooting. Authorities said neighbors told them the couple had a volatile relationship.

Authorities said they developed information on the possible whereabouts of Heath. St. Clair County Investigators, along with Haralson County Georgia Sheriff’s Office and the Cleburne County Alabama Sheriff’s Office, located Heath at the Alabama state line.

After an attempted traffic stop by authorities, Heath committed suicide by shooting himself.
