FLINT, MI -- Authorities have determined that the suspect at the center of an 11-hour police standoff and shootout earlier this month died as the result of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Flint spokesman Jason Lorenz confirmed Daron Raymond Gaylor Jr.'s cause of death.

Gaylor was found dead July 10 in the upstairs of a home at 422 E. Sherman Ave. following the standoff.

The standoff began at 10:30 a.m. near the corner of Sherman and Fulton Street. Around 5 p.m., Michigan State Police troopers entered the home and Gaylor opened fire on them, authorities have said. One trooper was hit, but suffered non-life threatening injuries.

The home near Fulton and Sherman was completely destroyed when police brought in heavy equipment to remove the home's roof.

Arrest warrants were issued for Gaylor for charges of first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder and three other gun charges after police claim his involvement in a June 2 double shooting that killed 28-year-old Ali McZick and critically injured 19-year-old Tyrell Gaylor near Martin Luther King Avenue and Welch Boulevard.

Police also wanted to talk with him in regard to a July 5 shooting that resulted in the death of previously injured Tyrell Gaylor -- Daron Gaylor's cousin -- and left an 8-year-old boy critically injured.

A woman identified by police as Gaylor's girlfriend, April Marie Abare, who lived at the Sherman Avenue home, was arraigned July 12 on charges of harboring a felon and lying to police during a violent crime investigation after she allegedly provided him with support while he was wanted in connection with the killings.

A preliminary exam hearing for Abare is set for Aug. 5.
