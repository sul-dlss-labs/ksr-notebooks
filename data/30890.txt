At that point, troopers with the West Virginia State Police, deputies with theLewis County Sheriff’s Department and Division of Natural Resources officers joined the pursuit, according to Gosa.

The chase continued through Jane Lew before stop sticks laid out near the Walmart in Weston caused the suspect to stop his vehicle and flee on foot, Gosa said.
