A Riverside man was sentenced Friday to 35 years to life in prison for the death of a passenger in a Long Beach crash at the end of a police chase that started in Westminster.

A Santa Ana jury earlier this year convicted Javier Homero Montoya, 44, of second degree murderwith sentencing enhancements for assault with a deadly weapon on a police officer for his role in a pair of 2014 pursuits that led to the death of 43-year-old Alberto Marquez.

Orange County Superior Court Judge Gary S. Paer said Montoya, in an effort to evade police, engaged in “ultra-hazardous activity” that presented a “high-risk to public safety,” including jumping a median and driving on the wrong side of the roadway and blowing through red lights. The judge also noted that Montoya has three prior DUI convictions on his record.
