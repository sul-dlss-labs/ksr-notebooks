CASPER, Wyo. — A man died Monday night following a police pursuit, a spokesman for the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation said Tuesday morning.

Special Agent Ryan Cox said when police arrived at the stopped vehicle, the man appeared to have been shot. Cox said an autopsy would determine with certainty whether the man died from the gunshot wound.

DCI is still investigating whether pursuing officers from agencies led by the Evansville Police Department fired their weapons. He said DCI has not yet determined whether the man fired at police.

The agency has not yet determined whether the man shot himself or whether police shot him, Cox said.

Investigators recovered a handgun at the scene, Cox said.

DCI is a statewide law enforcement agency that — among other duties — typically investigates shootings involving police officers.

The pursuit began Monday night, Cox said, following a citizen's call reporting a stolen vehicle. Police spotted the white Dodge pickup that had been reported stolen and took chase, following the truck north on Interstate 25. When the chase ended between the Center and Poplar Street exits, the man was found to be suffering from an apparent gunshot wound, Cox said.

The Natrona County Coroner's Office will perform an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of the man's death.

The Wyoming Highway Patrol, Natrona County Sheriff's Office and Casper Police Department were also involved in the pursuit, Cox said.

Although parts of the highway were closed Monday night, by 8 a.m. Tuesday, the scene had been cleared.

DCI is expected to release further details Tuesday.
