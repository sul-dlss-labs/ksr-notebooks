Vince "Vinny" DeMers, 22, Died when he was struck as he attempted to cross interstate 90 on foot.

He had been the driver of a vehicle who fled a traffic stop just hours before.

A deputy made a traffic stop at 9:42 p.m. Friday and the male driver fled on foot.

At 2:30 a.m. Saturday, a call came into dispatch reporting an individual walking westbound on Interstate 90. A Jefferson County Sheriffâ€™s Department deputy made contact with the pedestrian and identified him as the individual who had fled during the earlier traffic stop.

The man then ran from the deputy, crossed the median strip and was struck by an eastbound vehicle near mile marker 248.

Vince DeMers died at the scene.
