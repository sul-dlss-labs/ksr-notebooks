A police shooting occurred in a busy parking lot in Kalihi around 11:30 am Monday morning. Witnesses say they were terrified as they scrambled for safety.

It happened outside the New City Nissan car dealership on North King Street. The man police shot was taken to the hospital in critical condition, and was later pronounced dead.

Cell phone video from one of the workers inside shows the terrifying moments as police fired shots at a suspect trying to get away.

It appears some of the bullets had been fired through the glass windows at Nissan. Witnesses say they first heard a couple of shots from a distance, and then saw the HPD helicopter flying overhead.

“Next thing you know I see the guy in black pants black shirt come limping out through the parking lot at Nissan and I see everybody started to scatter running for cover,” said witness Jendsen Tengan Lumlung.

Witnesses say it appeared that the man had been shot in the leg, and was still trying to get away as police officers in plain clothes were chasing him. They say he tried running in between the parked cars, but police soon surrounded him.

“In the back of him we see like five or six cops kind of dodging, moving behind him and then he moved halfway down the parking lot and went through between the cars and they went up and around and caught him on the other end. And then five or six more shots went off and he didn’t get up,” said witness Kawehi Clifft.
