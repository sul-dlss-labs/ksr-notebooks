CROWLEY, LA (KPLC) - Authorities are investigating after an armed robbery suspect's body was found in a Crowley field on Monday morning.

Acadia Parish Sheriff Wayne A. Melancon said Slye Mier, 18, was found facedown.

"At this time, the cause of death is unknown," Melancon said in a news release. "We are treating this as a suspicious death, pending the outcome of the autopsy. His body is being taken to the Calcasieu Parish Coroner's Office."

Mire, of Eunice and Crowley, was wanted on charges of armed robbery, false imprisonment and unauthorized use of a moveable in connection with an incident Sunday night in Crowley.

Melancon said the Rayne Police Department stopped a vehicle connected to the robbery Sunday night.

"The officers attempted to initiate a traffic stop," Melancon said. "But the Silver Camero fled, and two occupants jumped out of the vehicle and fled on foot."

Melancon said one of the suspects, a juvenile, was arrested, but Mier escaped and warrants were issued for his arrest.
