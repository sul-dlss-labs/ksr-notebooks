A teenager who was among two people hospitalized Monday night after their reportedly stolen sedan crashed in Des Moines has died, authorities said.

The 16-year-old Des Moines boy was a passenger in the sedan; he died as a result of injuries from the crash, police said. Police identified him as Emilio Esteban Garcia.

The driver of the sedan, 17, of Des Moines, remained hospitalized Tuesday morning in critical condition.

The two were hospitalized Monday after the crash on the city's northwest side. Police said the injured were tied to an earlier drive-by shooting.

Officers received a report of a car stolen shortly after 8:10 p.m. Monday in the 1800 block of Jefferson Avenue in the city's Mondamin Presidential neighborhood. The victim said the sedan had been left unattended and running.

About 30 minutes later, officers responded to shots fired in the 4100 block of Rosehedge Drive in the city's Lower Beaver neighborhood. The gold sedan involved matched the description of the stolen car, Des Moines police spokesman Sgt. Paul Parizek said.

Officers believe the shots fired on Rosehedge Drive were aimed at other vehicles.

An officer then saw what appeared to be the gold sedan at 30th Street and Hickman Road, Parizek said. The sedan fled south on 30th at a high rate of speed when the officer tried to pull it over, authorities said.

A minute later, the sedan crashed into a U.S. Postal Service van at 30th Street and Jefferson Avenue — striking trees and fencing — just blocks northwest of Drake University, police said. The postal worker was not injured.

The teenagers found in the sedan were then transported to the hospitalized. Officers found a firearm in the sedan, police said.

Authorities said the series of incidents remained under investigation.
