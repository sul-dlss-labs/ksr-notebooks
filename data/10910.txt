A man has died after being shot by a Miami Beach Police officer in an early morning confrontation near South Beach nightclub Mansion.

A patrolling officer spotted 22-year-old Marvin Pognon wielding a gun in the midst of an argument between two large groups of people around 4:41 a.m. Friday outside a pizza shop at 1240 Washington Avenue, according to MBPD spokesman Deborah Doty, at the same time calls were being made to 911. Pognon refused orders to drop the weapon, she said, prompting the officer to open fire, striking him twice in the abdomen.

"The officer asked the subject to drop the weapon and he refused," Doty said. In a statement later Friday morning, she said witnesses confirmed the officer gave numerous commands to put down the gun before firing.

Pognon was rushed to Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Memorial Hospital, but did not survive. Investigators are still trying to determine if he was local or visiting Miami Beach, Doty explained, but she said detectives have determined the incident was unrelated to Mansion and began inside the pizza shop before spilling into the street.

Pognon's firearm was recovered on scene, and MBPD confirmed that as with all officer-involved shootings, its Criminal Investigations and Internal Affairs units will investigate along with the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâ€™s Office. The officer was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.

According to the Miami Herald, police may have a security video from inside the pizza parlor where the argument began.
