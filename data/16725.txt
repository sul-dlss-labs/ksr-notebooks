A sheriff's deputy shot and killed a Duluth man who was punching her in the head outside a home in east-central Minnesota, authorities said Thursday.

The confrontation occurred in the 500 block of Watkins Street in Mora about 9 p.m. Wednesday, according to the Kanabec County Sheriff's Office.

Thursday afternoon, the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the man as Robert Sullivan Christen, 37, and the deputy as Shanna McIalwain.

A few minutes before the shooting, Christen called 911 and said he "intended to kill someone" at the home, according to a statement from BCA, which is investigating the case.

A woman was in the home at the time, BCA spokeswoman Jill Oliveira said. Sheriff Brian Smith said the woman's two children were removed from the residence before the man arrived.

Soon after McIalwain arrived, Christen sped up to the home in a vehicle and crashed into a tree on the front lawn. The deputy exited the front door, and the man "immediately charged" at her, the BCA statement said.

She drew her gun and ordered the man to the ground, but "he ignored the orders and attacked the deputy, repeatedly punching her in the head."

McIalwain shot and fatally wounded Christen, who was pronounced dead moments later. The Ramsey County medical examiner's office conducted an autopsy and said Christen died of multiple gunshot wounds. McIalwain was treated at the scene for injuries to her forehead and an arm.

As is standard, McIalwain, a 1 Â½-year veteran, was placed on administrative leave.
