THORNTON | A man was pronounced dead Sunday at a hospital after Thornton police used a Taser to subdue him during an arrest, officials said.

Mark Koves, 28, of Crown Point, was pronounced dead at 5:44 p.m. at Franciscan St. James Health hospital in Chicago Heights, a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said.

The spokesman confirmed the death occurred after the man was hit with a Taser in Thornton. The official cause and manner of death was undetermined Monday night because of pending further tests, the medical examiner's office said.

According to a press release issued by Thornton police Sunday night, officers were called at 4:30 p.m. to a call of a naked man in the street near the Hubbard Park pavilion just west of Wolcott School.

When officers arrived, they found a man naked in the street. Police said the man became "very erratic and combative" when officers approached him.

The news release said officers were "able to subdue the man and paramedics transported him to the hospital for treatment."

Thornton Police Chief Douglas Beckman on Sunday night would not confirm the use of a Taser against the man or whether the man died shortly thereafter. They did not identify the man in the release.

Calls to Beckman's office on Monday were referred to the release issued Sunday night.

Illinois State Police on Sunday confirmed they were called out on a case in Thornton but did not confirm the circumstances. State police investigate police-involved deaths as a matter of protocol.
