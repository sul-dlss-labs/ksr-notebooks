A suspect was shot and killed by West Metro SWAT officers Tuesday after a nine-hour standoff in a Wheat Ridge hotel.

Around 1 p.m. Wheat Ridge police responded to the Ramada Inn at 4700 Kipling St. to assist Westminster officers in contacting a suspect with two nation-wide warrants for identity theft, criminal impersonation and forgery, said Lisa Spinder, spokeswoman for Wheat Ridge police.

The suspect, Gary Haney, 40, told police he was armed and said the only way he would be leaving the hotel would be in a body bag, Spinder said.

“The hotel was evacuated and guests were offered the option to stay at a different location following the incident,” Spinder said.

Police said that throughout the standoff, Haney repeatedly told officers he had a gun. Investigators said Wednesday afternoon Haney instead had “fashioned a metal Leatherman-type tool to simulate a handgun” and raised it “in a threatening manner,” which prompted three officers to shoot him with five rounds.

Haney was rushed to St. Anthony’s Central in Lakewood but was pronounced dead a short time later.

Court records show Haney has an extensive criminal history. He was arrested by Denver police on forgery and identity theft charges in April and failed to show up for a May court hearing, records indicate. Haney was arrested on similar charges in Denver in November and had ab arrest warrant in that case, as well.

He was sentenced to two years in state prison in 2005 after Denver police arrested him on robbery and assault charges.
