One man died following an officer-involved shooting in Laclede County on Thanksgiving Day.

According to the Laclede County Sheriffâ€™s Office, deputies and the Missouri Highway Patrol were dispatched to the 32000 block of Delta Road at 4:39 p.m. Thursday in reference to an intoxicated male in possession of a firearm threatening to commit suicide. The 911 caller, the mother of the suspect, was outside the residence hiding when the call was made.

Deputies arrived on the scene and attempted to negotiate with the suspect, Nikolas Wanner, 32, who was inside the home. Deputies set up a perimeter around the house and attempted to negotiate with Wanner. At approximately 7:00 p.m., Wanner exited the back door of the home armed with two rifles and a handgun.

A deputy covering the door demanded Wanner to drop the weapon. Wanner then pointed the rifle at the deputy. The deputy fired one round from a 12 gauge shotgun striking Wanner, who later died at the hospital.

The Missouri Highway Patrol Division of Drug and Crime Control are investigating. The deputy who fired the fatal shot was placed on administrative leave.
