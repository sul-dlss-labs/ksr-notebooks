Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by an off-duty Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy Wednesday, June 9, in the 1800 block of Morningside Court in Azusa, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The deputy, assigned to the West Hollywood Station, was driving through a condominium complex early Wednesday morning when he witnessed a male and female near some parked cars acting suspiciously, according to a news release from the Sheriff's Department.

The deputy pulled up in his vehicle beside the two, identified himself as a deputy sheriff, and asked what they were doing in the area, authorities said.

The male, later identified by the coroner's office as Anthony Aguilar, then allegedly reached for his waistband, investigators said. Fearing Aguilar was arming himself, the deputy fired one round from his duty weapon, striking him, according to sheriff's officials.

Authorities were called and Aguilar was pronounced dead at the scene, according to coroner's records. The female was detained and is being interviewed by homicide investigators, the department said.

Investigators said they did not immediately locate a weapon near Aguilar.
