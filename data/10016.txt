Three family members died after their car was struck by an SUV driver on parole who fled police in a high-speed chase to avoid being cited for a traffic violation, authorities said Friday.

The crash Thursday night in Visalia took the lives of Ruben Mendoza, 52, Gloria Mendoza, 54, and Ruben Mendoza, Jr., 17.

Police said Erick Joel Head, 32, was arrested on suspicion of evading a police officer and violating parole for a crime authorities declined to disclose. Police said they did not know whether he had retained a lawyer yet.

A Tulare County deputy tried to pull over the SUV for an unspecified traffic violation on Highway 99 when the driver took an exit and fled. The SUV crashed into a Chevrolet sedan about 2 miles later with the deputy in pursuit. The deputy was not involved in the crash.

The deputy, who was not identified, was placed on paid administrative leave, sheriffâ€™s Lt. Keith Douglass said. Authorities are investigating whether department policy was followed in the high-speed chase.

The three victims were all occupants of the Chevrolet. A female passenger in the SUV was transported to the Kaweah Delta Medical Center with a head injury. Her name was not released.

A third vehicle was also struck. The driver and passenger of that car suffered minor injuries and were released from the hospital.

Head tried to flee the scene on foot, Douglass said, but was caught by the deputy.
