CUYAHOGA FALLS — A man was found dead in a home after a long standoff with SWAT officers, which started when he shot at Cuyahoga Falls officers Sunday.

Police Chief Jack Davis said Cuyahoga Falls officers responded to an apartment on Pleasant Meadow Boulevard at about 4 p.m. Sunday. Stow police had asked for assistance after someone at the residence was involved in an incident in Stow.

Davis said officers knocked on the door to speak with a man inside, but no contact was made. Then shots were fired from inside the apartment at officers.

He said the officers were not injured, but that rounds went through the door.

“It just shows what they do every day, and how dangerous it is,” Davis said.

A perimeter was set up, and the Cuyahoga Falls SWAT team was called.

SWAT attempted to make contact with the man inside for several hours. Summit Metro SWAT was called in for mutual aid.

At about midnight, officers entered the home and found a man deceased. Davis said no one else was in the home.

The Summit County Medical Examiner’s Office is investigating the death as a suspected suicide. The man’s identity will not be released until family members are notified.

Davis said the department is still investigating the incident.
