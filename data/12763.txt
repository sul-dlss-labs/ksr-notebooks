San Bernardino County sheriff’s officials have identified a Central California man suspected of killing a Beaumont man, who died in a shootout with police in San Bernardino.

Bryan Snyder Valle and Jose Eduardo Guzman, both 19 of Earlimart, near Bakersfield, led police on a high speed pursuit Thursday, May 9, from Yucca Valley to San Bernardino, according to a sheriff’s statement.

The two men are accused of killing Obette Lacap, 33, of Beaumont in either an attempted robbery or carjacking Thursday morning as he sat in a mall parking lot in Yucca Valley.

Sheriff’s deputies and California Highway Patrol officers spotted the car following the shooting and chased the two men down Interstate 10 until they exited off Hospitality Lane in San Bernardino.

When the car crashed into an embankment at the end of a business park, authorities said both men jumped out of the car and opened fire, shooting a CHP officer in the leg.

Authorities returned fire in the gunbattle killing Valle at the scene and injuring Guzman.

The CHP officer was treated for his injuries and released. Guzman remains hospitalized and has not been booked into jail or charged.

Authorities have not said what either men were doing in Yucca Valley or why Lacap was targeted.
