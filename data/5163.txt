DUNKLIN COUNTY, MO -- A short police chase in Dunklin County ends with a Region 8 man dead. Kennett resident Darrin Morrow died Sunday after a self-inflected gunshot to the head.

As rumors and speculation swirl through the Kennett community, the Dunklin County Sheriff sets the record straight.

Morrow, 33, had been probation for stealing since the first of the year. Wanted for felony warrants, he was spotted on Highway "Y" just outside of Kennett on Saturday evening. A Dunklin County deputy attempted to stop Morrow around 7:00 p.m.

"He turned around and got behind him and activated his lights and siren. Mr. Morrow did not pull over at that time and drove a little further," said Sheriff Bob Holder.

Morrow finally stopped when he saw another police vehicle in front of him. He got out of his truck holding a .22 cal pistol.

"He was asked to drop the weapon, he did not," said Holder.

Morrow then shot himself in the head. Originally brought to Twin Rivers Regional Medical Center, he was transported to St. Francis Hospital in Cape Girardeau where he died 24 hours later.

"He was a nice guy. He had never given us any problems before, he was a good individual," said Holder, "We have no idea why he shot himself. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, we just hate that things like this happen."

The incident is still under investigation with the Dunklin County Sheriff's Department and the Missouri Highway Patrol's Division of Drug and Crime Control. Morrow's felony warrants were for probation violation.
