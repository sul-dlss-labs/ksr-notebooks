A 20-year-old Pomona man, who’s accused of killing a friend during a crash that occurred while the defendant was allegedly fleeing from Riverside County sheriff’s deputies trying to stop him for reckless driving in Jurupa Valley, made his first court appearance Monday.

Christian Pinon is charged with second-degree murder, felony evading and three counts of assault on a peace officer for the Sept. 29, 2018, wreck.

Pinon appeared before Superior Court Judge David Gunn, who appointed him a public defender and scheduled his arraignment for June 10 at the Riverside Hall of Justice.

The defendant is being held in lieu of $2 million bail at the Robert Presley Jail in Riverside.

According to sheriff’s investigators, Pinon allegedly caused the death of Jose Parra near the intersection of Agua Mansa Road and Brown Avenue.

Deputy Gerardo Medina wrote in an arrest warrant affidavit that about midnight, Pinon was involved in a so-called “sideshow,” which involves speeding and automotive stunts in vacant lots. intersections and freeways.

Patrol deputies spotted the defendant’s 2006 Pontiac GTO in the middle of an illegal maneuver and signaled him to pull over, according to Medina.

“During the traffic stop, (Pinon) was slowing down to pull his vehicle over alongside the curb, when Parra said, `Keep on going,”’ the affidavit alleges. “Parra encouraged him not to stop. Pinon said, `(expletive) it,’ and he accelerated his vehicle, made a U-turn, drove toward and in between the police cars and subsequently crashed his vehicle against a utility pole.”

Parra suffered catastrophic injuries in the crash and died at the scene. Pinon suffered minor injuries and was arrested but posted bail and was released that weekend.

No deputies were injured.

According to detectives, the ensuing investigation lasted nearly a year. Pinon, who has no documented prior felony convictions, was arrested without incident last Thursday in Dana Point.
