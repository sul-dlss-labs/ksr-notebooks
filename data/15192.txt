Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 5900 Bonhomme

October 8, 2014 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed kidnapping suspect at 5900 Bonhomme about 3 a.m. on Tuesday (Oct. 7).



The suspect, Armondo Ochoa, 36, was pronounced dead at the scene.



The female victim, Ochoa's estranged wife, 34, was pulled to safety and not injured.



Two Tactical Operations Division officers, Senior Officers M. Campbell, sworn in as an officer in August 1999, and K. Arntz, sworn in as an officer in December 1992, discharged their weapons. Neither officer was injured.



HPD Homicide Division Officers K. Winningham and S. Overstreet reported:



The suspect hid inside the victim's vehicle and, when she got off work, he forced her at gunpoint to drive to a hotel. Once at the hotel, the victim attempted to get the attention of others to get help. Hotel workers called 911. The suspect again forced the victim at gunpoint to return to her vehicle and to drive to an area on Bonhomme. The vehicle was parked and located by officers. The suspect barricaded himself and the female inside the vehicle and refused to come out. SWAT officers arrived at the scene and, after some time, the suspect got out of the vehicle armed with a gun. At that time, two officers discharged weapons, striking the suspect.



As is customary in HPD officer-involved shooting incidents in the city limits, the case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions as well as the Harris County District Attorney's Office.
