A Fairfield man died while in police custody after he engaged in a struggle with Solano County Jail staff, police said.

At approximately 9:20 p.m. Tuesday, Fairfield police received a 911 call from a citizen at a motel in the 2100 Block of North Texas Street reporting a man was acting strange and attempting to get into a nearby office. The caller added that the man had blood in his mouth and was walking back and forth yelling.

According to police, when two officers arrived, Fred Barlow, 61, of Fairfield, allegedly charged at them and engaged the officers in a physical confrontation. As a result, two more officers arrived, and following a short struggle, Barlow was handcuffed, police said.

Police noted that Barlow appeared to be intoxicated. He was later arrested on suspicion of public intoxication and resisting, obstructing, or delaying a peace officer, police said. Once handcuffed, Barlow allegedly started kicking at the officers, leading them to apply a RIPP Restraint to Barlow’s ankles. Police said that Barlow walked to the police car under his own power before he was transported to Solano County Jail.

A statement from police reported that Barlow was “awake, alert and talking” during the short drive to the jail.

While inside the jail, a struggle ensued between Barlow and the correctional staff. According to police, during the struggle, Barlow suffered an unknown type of medical emergency. After correctional staff began CPR and called for paramedics, Barlow was taken to a local hospital immediately. Despite undergoing treatment at the hospital, Barlow passed away Thursday morning.

The Fairfield Police Department has since requested the Solano County Fatal Incident Protocol be invoked. The incident is being investigated by the Fairfield Police Department, Solano County Sheriff’s Office, and the Solano County District Attorney’s Office.
