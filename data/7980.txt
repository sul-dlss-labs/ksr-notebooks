A 50-year-old parolee who had been out of prison for five months was shot dead by a parole officer in Queens on Tuesday after he grabbed another officer and threatened her with a knife, the authorities said.

The parolee, identified by the police as Eric van Reid, of Sunnyside, was at the State Division of Parole office at 92-36 Merrick Boulevard in Jamaica for an appointment, the authorities said. He was released from prison in November after serving 19 years for rape and burglary. He had spent more than half his life in prison.

Officers asked to search Mr. van Reid’s backpack about 9:30 a.m., said the Police Department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne.

They saw him take something out of his bag and try to hide it in his chair, Mr. Browne said. A parole officer approached him and “he grabbed her,” said Mr. Browne.
