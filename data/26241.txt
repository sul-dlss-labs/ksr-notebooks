The Rutherford County District Attorney's Office has cleared Smyrna police officers after their involvement in the shooting death of William Lamb.

Authorities responded to the 100 block of Chestnut Street in Smyrna after receiving a domestic violence call. There they discovered that Lamb and shot twice at his wife with a gun, a news release says. Smyrna Officer Kevin Byers ordered Lamb to drop his weapon, but instead Lamb shot at Byers, missing the officer by approximately a foot. Byers returned fire and shot Lamb three times.

After firing at the man, Byers and fellow officer Robert Cash began to render first aid to Lamb before he was transported to StoneCrest Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation investigated the officer-involved shooting. District Attorney Jennings Jones cleared Byers of any criminal wrongdoing Wednesday. Additionally, the Smryna Police Department cleared Byers and Cash of any policy violations.

This is the second incident in 2019 of officers fatally shooting suspects in Rutherford County. In February, Rutherford County deputies fatally shot Allon Jones five times at his home in Walter Hill.
