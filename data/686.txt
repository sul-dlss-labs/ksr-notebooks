Four Pomona police officers will not face charges in connection with the January shooting death of an unarmed man, the San Bernardino County district attorney’s office announced Tuesday.

George Hernandez, 30, was shot in the parking lot of the Ontario Red Roof Inn in the 1800 block of East Holt Boulevard at 1:30 a.m. Jan. 16, after a 10-minute chase in which Hernandez sideswiped parked cars and nearly hit a pedestrian. Officers said he reached for his waistband and said he had a gun. Witnesses contradicted the officers’ account, said Gregory Moreno, the Hernandez family lawyer.

Officers Bert Sanchez, Robert Devee, Anthony Luna and Dennis Cooper opened fire because they feared for their lives, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Maxwell said in the case report. Hernandez was shot 22 times.
