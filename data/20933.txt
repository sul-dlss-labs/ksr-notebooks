A Detroit man has been charged with murder after he allegedly fled from a traffic stop Tuesday in Wyandotte, lost control of his car and crashed, killing his front-seat passenger.

Eric Lamont-Allen Turnipseed, 33, faces charges of second-degree murder, first-degree fleeing and eluding reckless driving causing death and driving with a suspended license, causing a death. He is expected to be arraigned Thursday in Wyandotte’s 27th District Court.

Turnipseed’s passenger, Joshua Nance, was partially ejected and sustained fatal head injuries during the crash, which occurred around 8:30 p.m. Tuesday near Fort and Ford, police said. Nance’s age and hometown remained unclear Thursday.

Wyandotte officers initially attempted to stop Turnipseed after he allegedly disregarded a red light at Fort and Ford, police said. Turnipseed fled through a second red light, came to a brief stop and sped off again when officers approached.

Turnipseed then lost control of his vehicle, ran off the road and struck a large sign. The vehicle overturned before coming to a stop, police said. Turnipseed was taken into custody at the scene.
