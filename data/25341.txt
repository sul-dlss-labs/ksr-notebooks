FLINT, MI – A Flint Township man has been charged with second-degree murder in the earlymorning Christmas Eve crash that killed two people.

Lorenzo Jackson, 23, was arraigned on Friday, Dec. 28, in Genesee District Court on charges that include two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of first-degree fleeing and eluding police.

He is being held in the Genesee County Jail without bail.

Flint police responded at 12:42 a.m. on Monday, Dec. 24, to the intersection of South Saginaw and Twelfth streets and found two people dead at the scene inside a Pontiac Grand Am, according to a statement.

Investigators allege Jackson was driving a white Ford south on South Saginaw Street at a high rate of speed, ran the traffic light at Twelfth Street and crashed into the Grand Am, Flint police said.

Officers allegedly saw Jackson swerving in traffic, activated their emergency lights and sirens to try and stop his pickup, but Jackson ran the red light and caused the fatal crash, according to a statement from Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton.

A man and a woman inside the Grand Am were pronounced dead at the scene.

Jackson was initially listed in serious condition at Hurley Medical Center, according to the statement.

Drugs and the Ford Ranger’s high rate of speed are believed to be factors in the crash, Flint police said.

Investigators did not release the names of those involved in the crash.

“At a time when many people are celebrating the joys of the holidays with friends and family, a terrible tragedy has unexpectedly taken two lives,” Leyton said. “My heart goes out to their families as they deal with tragic losses.”
