The Bordentown Township Police Department reported that a 41-year-old male died after a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police officials reported an incident, which originated at approximately 10:15 a.m. on July 3, where a male’s girlfriend informed police that the subject committed several acts of domestic violence against her during a recent stay at the Holiday Inn Express located at 195 Route 130 in Bordentown Township.

Officials said they then responded to the hotel to investigate and encountered the male subject standing outside. A responding Bordentown Township officer then attempted to speak with the male, but he took off running and produced a handgun from his waistband, according to police officials.

The officer followed the male into a wooded area behind the hotel where at this point, the male took his own life with the handgun he possessed, officials said.

Police officials reported that no officers fired their weapons during this incident.

The Burlington County Prosecutor’s Office responded to the scene and assisted with the investigation as well as the Bordentown City Police Department and the Mansfield Township Police Department.

Police officials said the subject’s name is not being released at this time.
