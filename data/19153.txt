NEWARK - Preliminary autopsy results indicate a Licking County Sheriff's Office deputy shot his wife multiple times before turning the gun on himself.

Mickey Lymon, an investigator with the Licking County Coroner's Office, said Elizabeth Barnhart Lewandoski died from multiple gunshot wounds. David Lewandoski died of a single gunshot wound to the head.

Lymon said the manner of death has not been determined and remains under investigation.

It is unclear how long the couple was dead before their bodies were discovered shortly after 8 p.m. Thursday night at their Price Road home. The results are consistent with Elizabeth Barnhart Lewandowski being killed by David before he committed suicide.

David Lewandoski, 34, was a 10-year veteran of the Licking County Sheriff's Office and had been working in the patrol division. Elizabeth Barnhart Lewandoski, 24, was a registered nurse working at Licking Memorial Hospital.

David had worked at the sheriff's office since August 2006. Sheriff Randy Thorp previously said he was a good police officer who did his job and never had any significant issues. He had worked in the Licking County Justice Center for about eight years and had worked in the patrol division on the midnight shift for about two years.

The Bureau of Criminal Investigation is conducting the investigation in part for transparency in the investigation and to help with the emotional toll of the case on the deputies and detectives involved, he said.

A celebration of life service for Elizabeth will be held at 4 p.m. Saturday at Brucker-Kishler Funeral Home in Newark. Friends and family may call from noon to 4 p.m. Saturday.

An online fundraiser has been started to help raise money for her family to cover the funeral expenses and other costs. Nearly $5,000 had been raised in less than 24 hours.
