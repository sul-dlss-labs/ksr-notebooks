A Chamblee Police Department officer fired shots, killing a man, while responding to a domestic violence incident on Wednesday morning.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said at least one Chamblee officer shot and killed 40-year-old Chamblee resident Irlin Paz while he attacked a woman with a knife. The GBI said both Paz and the woman died at the scene.

Police said the incident occurred at Chamblee Heights Apartment Homes at 136 Wiggins Way. Police said the call "escalated into an officer-involved shooting."

Police said officers responding to the domestic disturbance immediately intervened to stop Paz from attacking the woman with a knife.

Police said another man inside the apartment was badly injured by multiple stab wounds while trying to stop the attack. Police said he was transported to Grady Memorial Hospital and underwent surgery.

Once the GBI investigation is complete, investigators will release their findings to the DeKalb County District Attorney's Office. This is the 72nd officer-involved shooting investigation the GBI conducted this year.
