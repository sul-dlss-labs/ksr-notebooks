Glendale police are releasing more information about a deadly officer-involved shooting on April 20.

Around 7 p.m., a Fugitive Task Force based in the East Valley responded to the area of Northern and 53rd avenues, after receiving reports about an “armed and dangerous” suspect in the area.

According to authorities, 25-year-old Brandon Pequeno was wanted for multiple felony charges, including kidnapping, domestic violence and aggravated assault.

The Fugitive Task Force — comprised of officers from local and federal agencies — was attempting to arrest Pequeno, who was believed to be driving a stolen car, Glendale police said.

During their attempt to take Pequeno into custody, the suspect began ramming other cars in an attempt to flee, officials said. He was also ignoring officers’ commands during the incident.

Three members of the task force, who are also Mesa police officers, feared for their safety and shot at the car Pequeno was driving with two passengers also inside.

Pequeno was taken to the hospital for a gunshot wound and died shortly after, police said. A 17-year-old girl, who was also in the vehicle at the time of the shooting, was critically hurt from being shot and later died from her injuries.

The third person, a 25-year-old man, did not suffer injuries and was detained for questioning by police.

Officials are still trying to determine the relationship of the three but it appears they all know one another.

No officers were injured during the incident.
