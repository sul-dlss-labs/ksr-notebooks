An East Feliciana Parish sheriff's deputy who fatally shot a fleeing man suspected of stealing raw chicken from an Ethel business will soon go before a grand jury that will weigh whether to bring criminal charges.

Deputy Glenn Sims Sr. shot Christopher Whitfield, a 31-year-old who had broken into a cooler in the early morning hours of Oct. 14 at the Texaco gas station and convenience store.

According to investigators, Sims fired a warning shot into the ground in an effort to stop Whitfield from running. Sims caught up to Whitfield and grabbed the back of his hoodie, which led to a struggle on the ground behind the gas station. During their scuffle, Whitfield hit Sims' gun, causing it to fire and strike him in his lower back. Whitfield died at the scene.
