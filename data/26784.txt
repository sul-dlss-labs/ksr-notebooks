A Worcester man died and two Rutland cops were injured after a police chase ended in a three-car crash, Friday night.

The man, identified as 63-year-old Kevin St. Peters, allegedly drove away from a traffic stop in Paxton and was killed when his car crossed the double middle line on Route 122, hitting a Rutland K9 Police cruiser head-on, the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office said.

Around 6 p.m. several 911 callers in Paxton had reported that St. Peters was driving erratically. Paxton and Rutland police were responding to the call when St. Peters took off, according to the DA.

At 6:35 p.m., near 225 Barre Paxton Road, St. Peter’s Ford Fusion crossed the double center line into the southbound lane, struck the Rutland cruiser and veered off into the woods. Attempting to avoid the crash, the Paxton cruiser went off the road and rolled over.

Rutland Police Officer Matthew Fenuccio, Rutland K9 Cooney and Paxton Police Officer Edward Santiago all sustained non-life threatening injuries.

The crash is under investigation by the Rutland Police, the State Police Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Section and the State police Detectives assigned to the Worcester County District Attorney’s Office.
