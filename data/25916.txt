An Upstate police officer fatally shot a motorist Tuesday morning, according to Thom Berry, with the State Law Enforcement Division.From Sky 4, multiple law enforcement and fire vehicles could be seen responding to the area of the shooting, which is on Wall Street near McCarter Road. Coroner Kent Dill later identified the motorist as 24-year-old Chadwick Dale Martin Jr., of Fountain Inn.Berry said a Fountain Inn police officer ran a tag on a car just after 10 a.m. and found that it was stolen. When the officer tried to pull the car over, Martin pulled into a space in a parking lot, Berry said. Berry said the officer and Martin got out of their vehicles and there was a confrontation and a scuffle.Martin got back in the car and tried to drive over the curb in the parking lot, Berry said. He said after Martin pulled forward, the driver put the car in reverse and hit a second Fountain Inn police car that had just arrived at the scene.Berry said Martin then tried to pull away with the officer holding onto the car. The officer fired his weapon, hitting Martin, Berry said.The white car crashed into a chain-link fence across from a Bojangles restaurant.Martin was taken to Prisma Health Hospital where he died a short time later, the coroner said.The officer who was dragged by the suspect car and the officer whose patrol car was hit were taken to the hospital with minor injuries, Berry said.Video sent to WYFF 4 from Kevin Grubb shows the moments after the shooting as officers approached the suspect's car with guns drawn. A dog was recovered from the car. WYFF 4 is working to find out what happened to the dog. WYFF News 4's Madeleine Hackett said the driver's side window of the car was shattered and bullet holes were visible in the back door. She said the area around the crashed vehicle was surrounded by crime tape, and there is also crime tape around a nearby business that has a Maillis Strapping Systems sign. A witness who lives nearby told Hackett she heard what sounded like three or four shots and people who ran screaming from the Bojangles.State Law Enforcement Division agents have taken over the investigation, which is typical protocol for officer-involved shootings.
