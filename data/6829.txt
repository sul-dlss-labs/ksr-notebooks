A Joliet man died Sunday night on Interstate Highway 55 after he lost control of his pickup truck while fleeing police and struck a tractor-trailer truck head-on, injuring the other driver.

At about 10:20 p.m., a Crest Hill police officer tried to stop Eugene Gatewood, 33, after his pickup was clocked at nearly 20 m.p.h. over the speed limit near Plainfield Road and Sycamore Street, according to a news release from the Crest Hill Police Department.

Gatewood slowed and appeared to be pulling over several times, only to speed away from the officer, the release stated. The officer abandoned the pursuit when Gatewood entered northbound I-55 at Plainfield Road.

Witnesses told investigators that Gatewood was driving recklessly and then lost control while trying to pass another car on the left shoulder near Renwick Road, according to Illinois State Police Trooper Mark Dorencz. The truck careened into the median, began to overturn and then struck a tractor-trailer truck in the southbound lanes.

Gatewood was pronounced dead at the scene, and the truck driver, Michael Quartuccio, 44, of LaPorte, Ind., was taken to Provena St. Joseph Medical Center in Joliet. His injuries were not considered life-threatening, Dorencz said.

Gatewood had an outstanding warrant for a 2004 arrest in Bolingbrook for drug possession, according to court records. He also failed to appear in court after he was arrested in 2005 for driving on a revoked license, the records show.

In 1996, he pleaded guilty to driving under the influence and was sentenced to court supervision.

State police are investigating Sunday's crash.
