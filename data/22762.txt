WEST SPRINGFIELD - An armed male, fleeing police Thursday night following a domestic dispute with his girlfriend, shot himself in the head on the traffic island near the Memorial Avenue Dunkin' Donuts, killing himself instantly, police said.

Police Chief Ronald P Campurciani, speaking Friday morning, said the incident remains under investigation. Police have not released the name of the male.

Campurciani said the incident began at a local restaurant. The girlfriend told police that her boyfriend, who had access to a handgun, was upset and wanted to harm her and himself.

While police were talking with her, the suspect, still at the scene, took off in his vehicle at a high rate of speed.

Police pursued the male south on Route 5. He then drove through a construction site on Memorial Bridge, causing two of his tires to blow out.

Campurciani said the suspect continued to drive, eventually stopping at Bresnahan Street and Memorial Avenue.

The male got out of the vehicle and ran back towards the Memorial Bridge rotary. When he reached the traffic island across from the Dunkin' Donuts, he took out a handgun and fired one shot, killing himself instantly, Campurciani said.

The incident, according to police radio reports, began about 10:20 p.m. A police officer reported a gunshot at about 10:47 p.m.

The incident is being investigated by the West Springfield Police Detective Bureau and the Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Hampden County District Attorney's office.
