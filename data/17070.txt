A pedestrian was killed after being struck by an unmarked emergency vehicle driven by a sheriff's deputy responding to a burglary in progress on Saturday in Hesperia, officials said.

The 35-year-old victim was walking south, across the eastbound lanes of Main Street at Fifth Avenue when she was struck by Deputy Jeromy Snyder with the San Bernardino County Sheriff-Coroner's Department as he drove through the intersection around 5:40 p.m., according to the Hesperia Police Department.

Snyder's partner, Officer Monique Garcia, was also in the vehicle.

The victim, identified by police as Monica Duboise of Hesperia, died at the scene.

Police said Snyder stopped his vehicle immediately and Snyder and Garcia began to render aid to Duboise. Police also added that east and west bound traffic on Main Street does not stop for cross traffic at the intersection.

Main Street was shut down from First Avenue to Seventh Avenue for about seven hours.

The collision is still under investigation. Police said speed was not believed to be a factor.

Any witnesses to this collision are urged to contact Deputies Jason Grantham or Travis James at (760) 240-7400.
