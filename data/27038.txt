A Kewaunee County sheriff's deputy will not be charged in the November 19th death of an armed kidnapping suspect. The victim, Luis Cardona, kidnapped Babette Carabollo from her workplace in Green Bay and was stopped by Kewaunee County Sheriff's Deputies near the county ATV park. Deputies, with help from a special weapons and tactics team, surrounded the vehicle Cordona and Carabollo had been riding in. Cardona fired several shots from a 45-caliber pistol at Carabollo, who opened a door and fell outside the vehicle. SWAT Officer Aaron Schley then fired several rounds from his rifle but did not hit Cardona or Carabollo. Cardona then turned his gun on himself. He died at the scene while Carabollo was treated for her wounds and survived. Kewaunee County District Attorney Andrew Naze's decision not to file charges against Deputy Schley came after reviewing a Wisconsin Department of Criminal Investigation report on the matter. Naze says while Deputy Schley did not strike Cardona his actions likely saved lives.
