Detectives with the Stanislaus County Sheriff’s Office are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting which took place Sunday morning in the 800 block of Business Park Drive directly north of the Mitchell Road bridge.



Patrol deputies were dispatched to a business in the industrial park at approximately 4:57 a.m. for reports of a silent burglary alarm. Once they arrived, deputies located a Hispanic man in his 40’s outside of the business.

Deputies made contact with the suspect who was armed with a hatchet, and while attempting to take him into custody, a struggle ensued which resulted in the suspect being killed by a deputy’s bullet. It’s unknown how many officers fired and how many times the man was hit. Two deputies, whose identities were not released, were injured. Deputies rendered emergency first aid on the scene and called for an ambulance for treatment. They were treated and released from a Modesto hospital emergency room.

The suspect was pronounced deceased at the hospital.

Both deputies will be assigned to administrative duties while the criminal and internal investigations are conducted. Representatives of the District Attorney’s Office will also be handling their own parallel investigation to review all facts and circumstances.

The criminal case is being handled by Detective Esquivez with the Crimes Against Persons Unit. She may be reached at 567-4466 should the public have any additional details to provide.
