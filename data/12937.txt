An officer tried to stop the biker about 12:30 a.m. on Miller Road near Jupiter Road, but instead of pulling over, the man fled west on Miller at speeds around 100 mph, leaving the officer far behind, a police spokesman said.

At the Plano Road intersection, the suspect slammed into a southbound Cadillac, spinning the full-size sedan and destroying the motorcycle. The suspect was thrown off the motorcycle, which burst into flames.
