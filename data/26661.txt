WILKES-BARRE — A man from Bear Creek Township died Saturday more than a week after he was struck by a vehicle during a pursuit with state police.

Luzerne County Coroner Dan Hughes said Gerald Mosley, 72, died at Geisinger Wyoming Valley Medical Center in Plains Township. An autopsy is pending an investigation, Hughes said.

Mosley was operating a 2013 Toyota on East Main Street, Wilkes-Barre, when he was struck by a 2004 Acura TSX, allegedly driven by Jose Mariano Crespo Mendez, 21, of Lehigh Street, Wilkes-Barre.

According to the criminal complaint:

A trooper on Interstate 81 in Hanover Township attempted to stop Mendez for driving a vehicle with a broken rear bumper, a broken rear window that was covered with plastic and an inoperable taillight at about 1 p.m. on May 24.

Mendez failed to stop and initiated a pursuit, weaving in and out of traffic and passing vehicles in the berm reaching speeds of 100 mph.

Mendez avoided stop sticks that were deployed by another trooper and turned onto state Route 115 toward Bear Creek.

State police allege Mendez continued to drive at a high rate of speed driving in the center no passing lane to pass other vehicles. Mendez allegedly turned around on Route 115 and nearly collided with a dump truck and turned onto East Mountain Boulevard.

Mendez turned onto Jumper Road and passed through a red traffic signal at Route 315 and continued onto East Main Street where he struck Mosley’s vehicle, the complaint says.

State police said the license plate on Mendez’s Acura was registered to a Cadillac owned by a woman in Hanover Township. There was no current registration and no insurance for the Acura.

Mendez told troopers he ran because “he was scared and admitted he was a “little high” from “smoking a bud” laced with cocaine, the complaint says.

Mendez is facing charges of aggravated assault, aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI, accidents involving death or personal injury, reckless endangerment, fleeing or attempting to elude police, and multiple traffic and vehicle code violations. He remained jailed Monday for lack of $50,000 bail.
