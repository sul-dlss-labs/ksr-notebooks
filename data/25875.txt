A man armed with a gun fatally shot himself Saturday after holing up inside a vehicle for more than three hours in a residential area of unincorporated Whittier.

The man was suspected of firing gunshots in the 7000 block of Norwalk Boulevard at about 3:30 p.m., said Lt. Robert Westphal of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. Though it was confirmed that there were shots fired in the area, it was not immediately clear who or what the man was firing at.

Once deputies arrived, the man got into the vehicle, Westphal said. After authorities tried to get the man to leave the vehicle, which was parked in an alley along the road, the man committed suicide at around 7 p.m. It was unclear what prompted the man to shoot himself.

For hours, a crisis negotiator spoke with the suspect, Westphal said. The negotiator was flanked by a heavy presence of deputies and a SWAT team with the sheriff’s department, as sheriff’s helicopters swirled overhead.

At 7:19 p.m., Los Angeles County Fire Department paramedics transported the man to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries, said County Fire Dispatch Supervisor Jeremy Stafford. The man’s identity was not immediately released.

Some residents in the area were taken aback by the heavy law enforcement presence throughout the incident.

A 66-year-old woman and former educator who lives nearby said she was driving along Norwalk Boulevard when she came across a barrier of patrol cars and sirens.

“Over here, the only time you see an ambulance is when someone is sick, and I’ve been here for 17 years,” she said.
