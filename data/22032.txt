EAST ORANGE — A man charged with carjacking a sport utility vehicle, then leading police on a chase that ended when he jumped a curb and struck a pedestrian outside a church, pleaded not guilty to murder today.

Jamal Abdul Silvera’s brief appearance in Superior Court in Newark came a day before his 22nd birthday, the same day his victim, James Callaway Sr., is to be buried.

Callaway, 63 and a Vietnam War veteran, had just stepped out of Saint Mark AME Church in East Orange on Friday morning, when the black Ford Explorer police say Silvera was driving struck him. Callaway died an hour later. The Maplewood resident was a church trustee who sang in the choir and a longtime employee of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Since Friday, authorities have reported close to a dozen carjackings in Essex County, most in Newark.

Silvera, of East Orange, stood quietly in court as his attorney, John McMahon, entered not guilty pleas to felony murder, carjacking, conspiracy to commit carjacking, aggravated manslaughter, eluding, two counts of aggravated assault and resisting arrest. Authorities say Silvera stole the SUV from a West Orange employee at a municipal garage there.

Minutes later, Silvera drove the truck into East Orange and, pursued by police, jumped the sidewalk on Glenwood Avenue and slammed into Callaway. The Explorer also struck two other vehicles.

Judge Peter Vazquez continued bail at $1 million.

In a statement, Callaway’s family called him "a very loving and caring man who could not do enough for his family, church and community."
