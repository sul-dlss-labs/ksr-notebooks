A Wyoming Highway Patrol trooper attempted to stop and briefly pursued a car that crashed into a truck Thursday night in Casper, killing two people and injuring three.

Late Friday afternoon, Natrona County Coroner Connie Jacobson identified the two Casper men who died in the crash: 39-year-old Douglas W. Arthur and 34-year-old Lyle Tsinnijinnie. Arthur was driving the car at the time of the crash and Tsinnijinnie was riding in the passenger’s seat.

The trooper attempted to stop the car just after 9 p.m. Thursday, because it was allegedly traveling south at 68 miles per hour on Salt Creek Highway, where the speed limit is 40 miles per hour. The man driving the car refused to stop, turned left onto West Yellowstone Highway and accelerated to a “high rate of speed” to elude the trooper, according to a news release from the highway patrol.

The trooper soon discontinued the pursuit, because “he realized he was in close proximity to the city limits of Casper,” according to the release. The trooper then turned around and traveled in the opposite direction of where the car had gone.

The car then collided with a truck at the intersection of First and Poplar streets, which were closed for a time.

Both men in the car died at the scene. The three people inside the truck, including two children, were taken to Wyoming Medical Center. Authorities declined Friday morning to say how the three were faring.

Casper police continued to investigate the crash Friday afternoon.
