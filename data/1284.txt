Illinois State Police Tuesday were investigating the death of a man shot by a Dolton police officer after he allegedly threatened police with a steak knife.

While the state police public integrity task force investigates the Monday shooting death of 27-year-old Myron Goodall, Patrol Officer Raymon Webb will perform administrative duties, said Dolton Police Assistant to the Chief Guy Lindsay.

Goodall, of the 15100 block of South Oak Street, allegedly chased his mother out of the home at knifepoint, Lindsay said. Goodall refused commands to drop the steak knife, then lunged at Webb, who fired his gun three times, police said.
