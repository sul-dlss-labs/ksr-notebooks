Police say they recovered a firearm at the scene.

“It’s a young couple, and there’s children there. I’ve never seen cop cars in front of their house, ever,” a neighbor told FOX 4.

The investigation into the shooting will be led by the ‘Johnson County Multi-Jurisdictional Officer-Involved Shooting Investigation Team.’ When their investigation is finished, they’ll hand over their findings to the Johnson County District Attorney’s Office for review.
