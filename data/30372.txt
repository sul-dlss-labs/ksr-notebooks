A Carroll County man is dead following an officer involved shooting in Green Forest today. Green Forest law enforcement authorities have asked the Arkansas State Police to investigate the incident.

Shortly before 8 AM a Green Forest police officer was dispatched to an apartment at 408 South Thorne Avenue. Three roommates of Maung Tway, 34, of Green Forest, reported to police that Tway was creating a disturbance and asked police to remove him from the apartment.

As a police officer asked Tway to step-out of his bedroom, Tway opened the door wielding a large knife. The officer ordered Tway to drop the knife, but Tway continued to approach the police officer brandishing the knife. Despite the officerâ€™s continued commands for Tway to drop the knife and stop, Tway still moved toward the officer who then fired his pistol wounding Tway.

Tway was transported to a Berryville hospital where he died. His body has been transported to the Arkansas State Crime Laboratory where the state medical examiner will confirm the manner and cause of death.

Special Agents of the state police Criminal Investigation Division will prepare an investigative case file to the Carroll County prosecuting attorney who will decide if the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer was consistent with Arkansas laws.

Any questions about the identity of the Green Forest police officer or the administrative status of the officer should be directed to the Green Forest Police Department.
