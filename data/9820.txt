Earl Rhodes, a 48-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police Monday, Jan. 24, in the 900 block of East 107th Street in Green Meadows, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Rhodes was slain after he was initially knocked to the ground with a bean-bag shotgun and struck with a Taser, Los Angeles Police Department officials said.

Two officers in a patrol car had arrived after receiving a call that Rhodes had refused to take medication and was verbally aggressive. Rhodes charged the officers after they tried to speak to him and calm him down, according to the LAPD.

The 240-pound Rhodes allegedly tried to grab the shotgun and a firearm from one of the officers.

"Both officers shot the suspect to stop his attack," the LAPD said in a statement.

Fire Department responders pronounced Rose dead at the scene.

Since January 2007, at least 153 homicides involving officer-involved shootings have been reported in Los Angeles County, according to a database compiled by The Times' Homicide Report.

An investigation into Rose's shooting is ongoing. Anyone with information is asked to call Det. Robert Solarza at (213) 486-5230. Tipsters who'd like to remain anonymous can contact Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800-222-8477).
