NEWARK — The teenager who died after attempting to carjack an off-duty Newark police officer Saturday was killed by a gunshot wound, not the injuries he sustained when he was ejected from a getaway car a short time later, autopsy results revealed today.

Vincent Owens, 17, died of a bullet wound to the chest after he was shot by the unidentified officer around 5:15 a.m. Saturday, according to Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray.

The teen approached the officer while brandishing a gun in the 100 block of Kerrigan Avenue, Murray said, but the two exchanged gunfire before Owens could steal the vehicle. Owens was shot once and fled with several others in a waiting getaway car, which Murray said was also stolen.

The car carrying Owens and the others crashed a short time later, and the teen was flung from the vehicle, according to Murray. Owens was pronounced dead at University Hospital in Newark at 7:30 a.m., she said.

It was not clear how many other people were in the vehicle, but police did recover a gun from the wreck.

The officer was also treated for shock at University Hospital, Murray said, and the shooting remains under investigation by Newark’s Internal Affairs bureau and the Prosecutor’s Office of Professional Standards.
