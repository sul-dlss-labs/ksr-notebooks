The Boulder County Coronerâ€™s Office has identified a 28-year-old Erie man as the person police shot after he allegedly pointed a gun at them.

Police shot Bryson Fischer near the Boulder Creek in the area of 13th Street and Arapahoe Avenue in Boulder on Sunday.

Two officers fired on Fischer when they confronted him about 2:15 p.m. Sunday at Boulder Creek under the Broadway bridge, where he had been firing a gun into the creek.

Police say preliminary information indicates Fischer pointed a gun at the officers before they fired at him.

Fischer was taken to Boulder Community Health, where he later died.

In 2007, Broomfield police arrested Fischer for the stabbing of a 25-year-old man at a party. He received 36 months in community corrections after pleading guilty to first-degree assault and felony menacing, according to Colorado Bureau of Investigations records.

His lengthy criminal record includes numerous drug charges.
