THOMASVILLE, N.C. – Officials said a Thomasville man was taken to the hospital after an exchange of gunfire with police on Monday night.

Police said officers responded to a home on Noah’s Trail around 6:30 p.m.after receiving reports of gunshots and a man threatening to harm himself.

After responding to the scene, officers say they attempted to make contact with the suspect, identified as 41-year-old Scott William Muntz, when he fired multiple shots from inside the home.

The special response team then responded and a negotiator attempted to make contact with the suspect again by telephone. However, police said there was another exchange of gunfire between the suspect and officers.

Police say the man was taken to Thomasville Medical Center and later transported to Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center where he is being treated in the Intensive Care Unit.

Per the department’s protocol, the four officers involved in the shooting have been place on administrative leave pending an investigation by the NC State Bureau of Investigation.

Authorities say no other information will be released until the SBI’s investigation is complete.
