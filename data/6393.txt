In the news: Colleen Tramontozzi of Norwich has sold a body of work in a gallery in St. Croix, Virgin Islands.

About her: Tramontozzi works at Hart’s Greenhouse in Norwich and has also taught as an art teacher at St. Patrick Cathedral School in Norwich, as well as at Connecticut College’s Multicultural Resource Center. She is a freelance studio artist with a passion for gardening. Painting and gardening, she finds, share a creative spirit in that she approaches both with a sense of color scheme. Tramontozzi also paints murals for private homes as well as businesses.

Education: She graduated from Norwich Free Academy and attended Southern Connecticut State University, where she studied studio art. She also was affiliated with Yale University’s Art Co-op, taking classes with renowned artist Foster Caldwell.

Family: Tramontozzi lives with her husband, Dan Tramontozzi, and has three children — Cara, Maura and James.

About the paintings: The seven paintings that sold were portraits of people who live on the island, landscapes and historic buildings. Tramontozzi said they were all painted with bright colors found in the Caribbean, such as bright yellow, hot orange and turquoise green, which she stuccoes onto the canvas. Some of her work is done en plein air, but much is done from photos so she can work in her studio at home. The paintings had been sitting for a while in the gallery, and Tramontozzi worried if they would ever sell. So she sent a friend, who lives in St. Croix, to collect them only to find an interior designer had purchased all of them for a client.

Quotable: “I paint because it’s my passion and something I love to do,” she said. “It’s in my heart and soul — the real joy is when other people enjoy it as much as I do.”
