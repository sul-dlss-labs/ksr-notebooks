Korey Mayfield is scheduled to stand trial next week on a charge of reckless homicide in a car crash that killed an Iva man in 2008.

Mayfield is scheduled to be in court in Anderson County on Tuesday. He is accused in the death of Christopher Adam Timms.

Timms died of multiple injuries he received when a car driven by Mayfield went off the road and hit trees on Leatherdale Road near Starr. The crash happened on July 11, 2008, two days before Timms' 26th birthday.

In a 2008 account of the accident, Anderson County Deputy Coroner Don McCown told the Independent Mail that alcohol and speed were factors in the crash that killed Timms and injured three others in the car, including Mayfield. McCown said then that several open, half-full cans of beer were found in the crashed car.

That same account says a trooper from the S.C. Highway Patrol had attempted to stop Mayfield for speeding before the crash, but ultimately had to stop a chase along S.C. 81 because of heavy traffic.

Moments later, the trooper came upon the crash.

A brief remembrance of Timms is posted on a memorial website associated with the State Highway Patrol.

Mayfield was originally scheduled to stand trial in mid-July. But his trial date had to be moved because he is being represented by defense attorney Chuck Allen, the same lawyer who represented former Anderson County deputy Tim Busha in his securities-fraud trial last month.
