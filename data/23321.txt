Phoenix police said a man is dead in an officer-involved shooting that happened Friday afternoon.

The shooting occurred in a northern alley by Third Avenue and Culver Street, near Margaret T. Hance Park in downtown Phoenix.

Police received a call at around 1:15 pm from a resident saying there was a male and female yelling near her home, Phoenix Sgt. Alan Pfohl said.

Once police arrived, they found "an adult male sitting with his back against a garage and he had his arms wrapped around an adult female with a knife to her neck," Pfohl said in an email.

While police tried to negotiate with the man to let go of the 57-year-old woman, he told officers he was sitting on a bomb, Pfohl said.

"The suspect charged at one of the officers with the knife, one officer fired his weapon and ended the threat," Pfohl said.

When officers attempted to move the woman away from the suspect, they realized he had wrapped a chain around her waist so that she was unable to get away.

Pfohl said it appears the man and woman knew each other, but investigators are still uncertain on the specifics of their relationship.

Police said the woman and the officer were not harmed.

Becky White of Phoenix said she was at the park when the shooting occurred.

"We were just sitting here, and we heard it. We thought it was a gunshot or a backfire of a car or something,'' she said.
