The knife-wielding man shot by Phillipsburg police on Monday morning has died, according to the Lehigh County Coroner.

Thomas Read, 36, of the 400 block of South Main Street in Phillipsburg, was pronounced dead at 3:10 p.m. Monday at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Fountain Hill, Coroner Scott Grim said. The cause of death was attributed to multiple gunshot wounds, he said.

The manner of death is pending the conclusion of the investigation by the Warren County Prosecutor’s office.

Read was shot just before 9:30 a.m. inside his home, authorities said. A police officer was also injured during the confrontation and was treated and released at St. Luke’s Hospital in Warren County.

According to the prosecutor’s office, police were called to the home to investigate a man who had sent threatening messages.

When officers arrived at the home, they found Read on the first floor holding a knife in a “threatening manner” and refusing to come outside. Police entered the home and confronted Read, who refused to drop the knife and was shot by police.

Three Phillipsburg police officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave, according to the prosecutor’s office.
