KEYSER, W.Va. — West Virginia state police shot and killed an armed man overnight after a 90-minute standoff.

Police identified the victim as Harvey E. Oates, 42.

Troopers said the incident began Friday night near Keyser upon receiving a call concerning a distraught man in possession of a gun. Police were familiar with Oates, who had outstanding warrants for trespassing and driving on a license that had been revoked for DUI.

Oates fled the scene in a vehicle a short distance before running off the road, state police said. He left the vehicle, threatening to shoot officers and himself. After negotiating with him for about 90 minutes, police said he became “extremely agitated” and began moving toward a trooper, aiming his weapon.

The trooper was forced to fire at Oates, who was killed, according to a state police news release.
