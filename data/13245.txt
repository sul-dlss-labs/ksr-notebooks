GLOSTER, Mississippi -- A police officer who was investigated and cleared in the stun-gun death of a suspect has been reinstated to service in Gloster.

The Enterprise-Journal reports the town's Aldermen voted 3-2 to reinstate Officer Terry Boss.

Boss had been on leave with pay during an investigation into the Aug. 13 death of 33-year-old Lucious Gaultney of Gloster.

Boss shot Gaultney when he fled after allegedly stabbing his wife.

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation investigated the incident and cleared Boss of wrongdoing, town officials said.

The town board spent 30 minutes in executive session Tuesday night before rendering its decision.

Supporting the reinstatement were board members Keisha Norwood, Joyce Perkins and Fannie Tobias. Voting against it were Eldon Hopf and Betty Ravencraft.

Aldermen took the vote with no discussion in open session.

Autopsy results have not come back from the state crime lab, and a cause of death has not been reported, Amite County Coroner Cam Sharp said.

According to police reports at the time, Boss responded to a report of a stabbing around 10 p.m. on Aug. 13 at a travel trailer on Mississippi Highway 24 West. Gaultney had allegedly stabbed his wife, Lakendra Gaultney, several times with a knife and fled west on foot.

Boss drove around and intercepted him. Gaultney allegedly disobeyed Boss' order to raise his hands and came at Boss, who shot him with a stun gun from a distance of nine or 10 feet, police said.
