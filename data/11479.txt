Juan Serna, a 30-year-old Latino, died Monday, June 25, a day after he was shot by law enforcement personnel near Bullis Road and Orchard Avenue in Compton, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

A deputy attempted to stop Serna at an intersection June 24 about 12:42 p.m., according to a sheriff's department news release.

Soon after, Serna fled on foot from the deputy and ran into the nearby Compton Fashion Center.

Officials said Serna was armed with a handgun.

While in the shopping center, the deputy contacted security and they went looking for Serna, authorities said.

Serna was seen exiting the mall and as the deputy and security guard followed, they were allegedly shot at by Serna several times.

Officials said both security and the deputy fired at Serna, who was struck in the head.

Paramedics were called and Serna was taken to a hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

Anyone with additional information about the officer-involved shooting is asked to contact the sheriffâ€™s homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
