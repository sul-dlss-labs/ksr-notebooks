As police tried to take the man into custody, the suspect pulled out a handgun and shot himself. An officer was injured from what officials believe may have been shrapnel from the bullet the suspect fired at himself.

The officer was taken to a hospital for treatment of his non-life threatening injury.

Police did not discharge any firearms during this incident. The man's identity has not been released yet. Police continue to investigate the incident.
