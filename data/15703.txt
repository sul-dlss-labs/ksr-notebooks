A La Quinta man was killed and three other people injured, after a police chase ended in a fiery four-car collision around 1 p.m. Friday on Washington Street north of Avenue of the States in Palm Desert, according to the California Highway Patrol.

Dario Colin, 33, had to be pulled from the burning 2003 Ford Focus he was driving and was pronounced dead at the scene around 1:15 p.m. by medical personnel, authorities said.

Colin was not wearing a seat belt and is suspected of driving drunk or on drugs, CHP said

Lori Polin, 58, from La Jolla — a passenger in a 2014 BMW 335i the Ford ran into the back of — was transported to Eisenhower Medical Center with minor injuries. Maria Mendoza, 34, from Grand Terrace — the driver of a 2014 Chevrolet Cruze rear-ended by the BMW in the resulting chain-reaction — was transported to Desert Regional Medical Center along with her juvenile passenger also with minor injuries.

Colin was reported around 12:45 p.m. to police for possible drunk driving heading east on Interstate 10 east of Cook Street, authorities said. A CHP officer found the Ford heading south on Washington Street north of Country Club Drive, and tried to stop Colin near Harris Lane.

The ensuing one-mile chase ended with the front of the Ford hitting the rear of the BMW — driven by Kenneth Polin, 60, from La Jolla — stopped at a red light at Avenue of the States, authorities said. Both cars sustained major damage, and the front of the BMW hit the rear of the Chevrolet.

Mendoza's car proceeded to rear-end a 2013 Dodge Ram 2500 driven by Eldon Hamrick, 47, from Soldotna, Alaska with his passenger Terri McQuiston, 31, from Salt Lake City.

None of the other cars caught fire, and southbound Washington Street remained shut down from 42nd Avenue to Avenue of the States for several hours.
