PENNSBORO, W.Va. – A man is dead after a long standoff with officers in Ritchie County.

According to state police, officers responded Wednesday evening to a domestic disturbance call to the residence of Stephen Wilson, 45, of Pennsboro, and found two victims had been maliciously wounded by Wilson.

Before arriving to the residence on Buck Run road, Wilson had maliciously assaulted the victims and fired multiple shots, one of which struck a male victim in the hand, according to state police. After police arrived on scene, the two victims were able to flee from the residence, and Wilson barricaded himself in the house, according to state police.

A standoff lasting approximately nine hours ensued, wherein Wilson and negotiators were in contact via telephone, and Wilson threatened multiple times to commit “suicide by cop,” according to state police. After negotiations fell through, tear gas was deployed and the state police high-risk injury team made its way into the residence, according to state police.

As the team entered the home early Thursday morning, they heard a gunshot and found Wilson deceased by an apparent gunshot wound, according to state police.

As of now, the victims of the incident have not reported any life-threatening injuries.
