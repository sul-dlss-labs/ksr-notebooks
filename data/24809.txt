PAWTUCKET, R.I. (AP) — A grand jury has found that police officers were justified in fatally shooting a 28-year-old man in Pawtucket last month.

The state attorney general’s office said Wednesday that the Providence County Grand Jury completed its investigation into the Sept. 7 fatal shooting of DaShawn Cole and determined that the actions by the three officers involved were lawful and legally justified.

Pawtucket Police say Officer Ana Vertentes tried to make contact with Cole after police received a call about a man with a gun. Police say Cole, who was armed, then attacked Vertentes and the officer fired her gun.

Officers William Briggs and Dianne Rittman-McLaughlin arrived during the struggle. Police say Cole then confronted the two officers and each of them discharged their firearms.

Cole was pronounced dead at the hospital.
