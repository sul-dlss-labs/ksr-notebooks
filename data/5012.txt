A jury has awarded $150,000 in punitive damages to the family of a man killed in a confrontation with a park ranger, according to a report on northjersey.com.

The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the family of Emil Mann, a Ramapough Indian, was awarded nearly $2.2 million in compensatory damages by a jury, which found the ranger had used unreasonable force.

Retired park ranger Chad Walder, who was accused of shooting Mann, was found not guilty on charges of reckless manslaughter in a 2009 criminal case. But a civil court jury found his actions "malicious or wanton," awarding the family the compensatory damages Tuesday and additional punitive charges Wednesday.

Because Walder acted in his capacity as a park ranger, the state is responsible for the $2.2 million. However, the state may not be responsible for the additional $150,000 in punitive damages.

The case stems from a 2006 incident in which park rangers approached several Ramapough men who were riding ATVs near Stag Hill Road in Mahwah. A confrontation occurred, and Walder drew his gun and shot Mann, who died nine days later.

The incident was the subject of a lengthy story published in The New Yorker magazine in March of 2010.
