Edgar Gonzalez, a 19-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, Dec. 21, near Vermont Avenue and Washington Boulevard in Pico-Union, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The shooting occurred shortly after 7 p.m., when officers began following a vehicle reported stolen from Long Beach, the Los Angeles Police Department said.

As the vehicle neared Washington Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, it struck a van. A man, later identified as Gonzalez, exited the first vehicle with a revolver and began firing at officers, police said.

The bullets struck at least two police cruisers, Officer Norma Eisenman said. Officers returned fire and hit Gonzalez.

Gonzalez was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. No officers were injured.

Investigators gathered evidence at the scene and recovered the revolver, police said. No other details were immediately available.
