Justin Ford, a 23-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy Saturday, March 12, in the 700 block of West El Segundo Boulevard in Harbor Gateway, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Ford, who was suspected of brandishing a gun at motorists on El Segundo Boulevard in Willowbrook, led Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on a chase about 3 a.m., according to Sgt. Diane Hecht.

After several minutes, he abandoned his motorcycle in the middle of El Segundo Boulevard just west of the 110 Freeway, removed his helmet and challenged deputies to a fight, she said.

Hecht said deputies fatally shot Ford after he removed what they thought was a handgun from his waist and pointed it at them.

The deputies were not injured, she said. A replica pistol was recovered at the scene.
