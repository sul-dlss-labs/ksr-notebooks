Oscar Morales, a 21-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Los Angeles police Thursday, May 27, in the 8300 block of Burnet Avenue in North Hills, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers responded to "a call for service involving a man with a history of suicide threats" at a house about 12:30 p.m., according to an LAPD news release.

When officers arrived, family members directed them to Morales, who was in the living room, police said.

The officers approached Morales, who they described as initially cooperative. According to the LAPD account, he then suddenly grabbed a fireplace poker and came at them, allegedly refusing to drop the poker. At that point, Officer Davis Giron, a 10-year LAPD veteran, shot Morales several times, according to an LAPD news release about the shooting.

Morales sustained several gunshot wounds and was taken to a hospital, where he died at 4:10 p.m., according to coronerâ€™s records.

The LAPD Force Investigation Division responded to the shooting location and are conducting an inquiry into the officer-involved shooting.
