An armed man who was shot during a confrontation with campus police near UC Riverside died at a hospital Monday afternoon.

Juan Garcia, 38, was mortally wounded shortly before 1 a.m. Sunday after he allegedly pulled a handgun on UCR police officers in the 3100 block of Watkins Drive, just east of Blaine Street.

According to Officer Ryan Railsback of the Riverside Police Department, 911 dispatchers received a flurry of calls about shots fired in the 600 block of Blaine Street, just outside the north boundary of UCR, and both campus police and Riverside police units raced to the area to investigate.

Railsback said UCR patrol units were the first to arrive, and officers confronted Garcia as he walked along Watkins.

“As they went to contact the male, he produced a firearm, and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Railsback said.

No officers or bystanders were hurt.

Railsback said a search of the suspect revealed he was in possession of two pistols, as well as an “improvised firearm” that the officer didn’t describe.

Garcia underwent surgery at Riverside Community Hospital, where he died of his injuries at 2:20 p.m.

No information was available regarding his city of residence or background.
