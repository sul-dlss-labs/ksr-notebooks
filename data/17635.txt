A Sapulpa man died early Sunday after the pickup he was driving crashed on Interstate 40 during a high-speed pursuit by an Oklahoma Highway Patrol trooper.

Alexander Larmon, 44, died after his vehicle was driving at a high rate of speed and the trooper used a tactical vehicle intervention maneuver, causing the pickup to lose control, run off the road and overturn multiple times, OHP said in a report.

The trooper, Jonathan Earls, 26, of Okemah, who was driving a 2012 Dodge Charger OHP cruiser, was not injured.

The crash occurred about 12:13 a.m. at mile marker 212.5, just east of Cromwell in the eastbound lanes of I-40.

The TVI maneuver is typically used by law enforcement in an attempt to cause a fleeing vehicle to turn sideways and come to a stop.

The 1990 GMC pickup Larmon was driving went off the interstate to the right, rolled several times and came to rest on its top, the report said.

Larmon was ejected about 10 feet from the vehicle. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

He had an odor of alcohol and was not wearing a seat belt, the report said.

The OHP report did not indicate estimated speeds during the pursuit.

Earls was not placed on administrative leave following the crash, OHP Capt. Paul Timmons said.

“This is typical in situations like this, unless there’s some kind of unusual circumstance,” he said. “And there’s nothing unusual, other than the fact the guy crashed and was killed.”

Timmons said it is unlike an officer-involved shooting situation, which normally results in the law enforcement agent being placed on administrative leave while authorities investigate whether the use of force was justified.

In this case, he added the driver died in part because he wasn’t wearing a seat belt.

The crash occurred about 70 miles southwest of Tulsa.
