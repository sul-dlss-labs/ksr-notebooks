YOUNGSVILLE, N.C. — A Raleigh man was killed Sunday night after he led police on a high-speed chase that ended in a crash in Franklin County, Wake Forest police said.

Authorities said Wake Forest police were chasing Marcus Richardson, 34, on White Street near Youngsville around 8:45 p.m. when the crash occurred near Thompson Circle.

According to officials, Richardson, who was driving a Chevy Impala, was stopped by officers after they ran the tag number of the car and learned the owner’s driver’s license had expired.

Officers ran Richardson's ID and learned that he was not the owner of the car, did not have a valid driver's license and had two outstanding warrants, one for felony fleeing to elude and the other for misdemeanor resisting a public officer.

As officers went back to the car to arrest Richardson, he sped off, they said. During the chase, officers lost sight of Richardson. He was located after losing control of the vehicle and striking an oncoming minivan head on.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

Richardson died at the scene.

The driver of the van, Alexander Castellon, 26, of Youngsville, was transported to WakeMed with minor injuries.

"It was real scary. I thought I was going to die, but I'm so thankful that I'm alive," he said. "There's nothing I could have done, nothing anyone could do, nothing the police could do to avoid something like that."

Two of Richardson's sons visited the crash sight on Monday in an effort to make sense of what happened.

"I want answers. I care about my daddy even though he's not here with me. He's still here with me. He ain't going nowhere," said Tyzaviel Jeffreys.

The State Highway Patrol is investigating the incident.
