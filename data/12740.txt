An Oregon State Police trooper has been cleared of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a St. Helens man after a high-speed chase near Scappoose earlier this month.

Columbia County District Attorney R. Stephen Atchison announced Wednesday that Trooper Justin Oxenrider, 32, a six-year veteran, was justified in shooting 27-year-old Josiah M. Fischer May 3 after he brandished a firearm.

Fischer's car was forced into a ditch by Oxenrider and Senior Trooper Robin May, 40, a 16-year veteran, on Hazen Road near Stone Road in Warren after they chased him from U.S. 30 near Wikstrom Road, the Columbia County Sheriff’s Office said. Fischer initially fled from the troopers when they tried pulling him over for speeding.

Oxenrider later fired nine rounds at Fischer after telling him to show his hands but he displayed a handgun instead, the sheriff’s office said. Fischer died at the scene.

Atchison said Oxenrider and May, who did not fire, are scheduled to return to regular duty this week.
