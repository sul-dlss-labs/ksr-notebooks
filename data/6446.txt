Peter Rodriguez, 23, a Latino man, died just before 5 p.m. Tuesday, Aug. 14, after being shot by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies during a shootout near the intersection of North Herbert Avenue and Whiteside Street in the vicinity of the 10 Freeway just after midnight.

Sheriff's deputies gave this account: Rodriguez was writing graffiti when two deputies surprised him. They ordered him to stop. He turned, dropped his spraypaint can and pulled out a gun in one motion, they said. He fired, blasting a hole in the back window of the patrol car, and the deputies shot back. Rodriguez was struck once; he was taken to a hospital, where he was listed in critical condition. He later died.
