Coal County Pursuit Turns Fatal, Kills Suspect, Injures Trooper

COAL CO., OK -- A fatal collision in Coal County, involves an Oklahoma state trooper.

It took authorities more than six hours to complete their preliminary investigation at the crash site on Highway 3 between Tupelo and Coalgate. Nearly a dozen law enforcement officers rushed to the scene whey they got word of the crash around 3 o'clock this afternoon.

"As it is with the general public when they hear about their family members, that's the same feeling we have because these guys are our family."

Trooper Mark Benedict with the OPH Division in Coalgate is back at home with family, he was able to walk away from the crash with only a few bumps and bruises.

But, by looking at the crash scene - that's a miracle. An 18-wheeler involved is totaled, and a Ford Explorer is unrecognizable. Authorities say Benedict went to pull over a man driving that SUV for a broken tail-light, but he didn't stop. He sped up, heading east down Highway 3. With his lights and sirens flashing, Benedict began the pursuit. About four miles into the pursuit, troopers say the suspect swerved across traffic and slammed head-on into an oncoming Braum's truck - killing the suspect on impact.

"Unfortunately we may never know why this suspect, this driver did this we may never have that answer, but that looks like what our investigation is pointing to, along with some witness statements."

We're told dash-cam video taken from the troopers car shows the suspect swerving right into the semi-truck. The suspect has been identified as 42-year-old Michael Allen Penny. The Braum's driver, 60-year-old Joseph Reyor, is okay. He was taken to the hospital in Coalgate to be checked out.

Troopers did most of the accident reconstruction Thursday night, but say this investigation is still ongoing. At this time, they do not know why Penny chose to run from the officer.
