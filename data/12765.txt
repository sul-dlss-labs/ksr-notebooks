The officer involved in a fatal crash with a motorcyclist south of downtown Minneapolis in May will not face criminal charges or discipline, Police Chief Janee Harteau said Thursday.

Ivan Romero Olivares, 24, of Minneapolis died when his motorcycle hit the rear of officer Joshua Young’s SUV at 26th Street and Blaisdell Avenue in Minneapolis’ Whittier neighborhood shortly after 4 p.m. May 10, according to police.

“This is not an example of an officer out of line,” Harteau said. “This is a traffic accident with a tragic outcome.”

Young was delivering bottled water to police at the scene of an officer-involved shooting — without his sirens activated — when another officer broadcast a request for additional officers to secure the shooting scene, according to a report from the Hennepin County attorney’s office.

Young turned on his sirens and emergency equipment after responding and began weaving through traffic. At the Blaisdell Avenue intersection, he slowed the SUV to 16 to 17 mph and was hit by Olivares’ motorcycle just before he cleared the intersection, the report said.

Olivares was traveling 32 to 34 mph before he collided with the SUV, investigators estimate. Video shows the motorcycle sliding on its side. Police said it’s likely the bike’s front wheel locked as Olivares tried to avoid a collision.

Olivares did not have a motorcycle endorsement on his license, according to police.

The investigation cited failing to follow speed limits and Olivares’ inexperience as factors in the crash. Both streets have a speed limit of 30 mph.

Young’s “failure to use due care” played a role in the crash, according to the report, but Harteau said an internal investigation did not find negligence.

“This is not a case of an officer carelessly running a red light,” she said.
