A Knoxville man who died during a confrontation with sheriff's deputies last week was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound as authorities opened fire on his vehicle, investigators have determined.

Knox County Sheriff's Office deputies had tracked Norman Lowell Vandergriff Jr., 42, to a Sevier County address on Happy Creek Road in Seymour on Aug. 8.

Vandergriff was wanted on several outstanding charges, including auto burglary, simple drug possession and theft, according to court records.

He was ordered out of his vehicle, but would not comply.

"At some point during the confrontation, the subject displayed a gun, which resulted in the deputies firing shots at the vehicle," according to a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation news release. "He was pronounced dead at the scene."

A TBI investigation has since determined Vandergriff shot himself, Fourth Judicial District Attorney General Jimmy Dunn announced in a news release Thursday.

"Vandergriff died as a result of a self-inflicted gunshot," the DA's release states, "and was not the result of shots fired by Knox County Sheriff's deputies."
