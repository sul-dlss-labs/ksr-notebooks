A Seminole police officer hit and killed an Immokalee man on Interstate 75 who had been let out of a car when an argument became heated early Saturday, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

Yvens Seide, 33, died at the scene of the 5:58 a.m. crash at Mile Marker 27, located along the Big Cypress Preserve in Broward County.

Officer Gary Paul Evelyn, 51, of Big Cypress struck Seide as he drove westbound in his marked Seminole police pick-up truck.

Evelyn was driving along the inner westbound lane when he came upon Seide, who was also in the inside westbound lane, the Florida Highway Patrol report said. Seide was hit with the truck’s left front, according to the Florida Highway Patrol.

The car that Seide had been let out of returned to the scene to find Seide dead, according to the Florida Highway Patrol’s report.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.
