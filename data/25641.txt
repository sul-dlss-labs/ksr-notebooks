Two Vancouver police officers who shot and killed a 29-year-old mentally ill homeless man brandishing realistic replica handguns Feb. 28 were legally justified in using deadly force, according to a review by the Clark County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office.

Officers Christopher Douville and Andrew Dunbar fatally shot Michael Eugene Pierce west of downtown Vancouver. Pierce, whose family said he was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia as a teenager, was reportedly pointing two replica firearms at himself, passersby and police.

Pierce’s actions would lead any reasonable police officer to believe he posed an imminent danger to himself and others, Senior Deputy Prosecutor James Smith wrote in his use-of-force report.

“In particular, Pierce had pointed his replica pistols at multiple people and vehicles and refused to drop them when ordered to do so. Though Pierce was not armed with an actual firearm, the officers had no possible way to know this,” Smith wrote.

Officers responded about 4:45 p.m. to West 12th and Jefferson streets for a report of an armed person. Shortly after, officers yelled shots had been fired and a man was down, with a firearm by his feet, according to emergency radio traffic monitored at The Columbian.
