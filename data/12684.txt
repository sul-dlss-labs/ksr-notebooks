PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) â€“ Grand jurors have cleared three Pleasantville police officers who shot and killed an armed man outside his home.

Approximately 10 officers in April responded to a 911 call from 19-year-old Alexis Perez, who told a dispatcher he felt like killing somebody.

The Press of Atlantic City (http://bit.ly/1atPWmO ) reports acting Atlantic County Prosecutor Jim McClain says officers did everything not to shoot Perez, including allowing him to get within 6 feet of them even though he was armed with a knife.

Three officers opened fire when Perez refused to drop the weapon. Seven bullets struck Perez in the head, neck, chest, shoulder and abdomen. He died at the scene.
