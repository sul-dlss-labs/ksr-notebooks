The district attorney's office has cleared a Seven Devils police officer of wrongdoing in a fatal shooting.

"After reviewing a report of the SBI investigation it is my opinion that the officer acted at all times in a legal and appropriate manner," Jerry Wilson, a prosecutor for 24th Judicial District, which includes Watauga County, said in a news release.

Walter Garland Steele III, 38, died Jan. 22 at Johnson City Medical Center in Johnson City, Tenn., nearly two weeks after he was shot by Seven Devils police officer Jonathan Harris.

Harris was responding to a complaint about loud music and shots being fired. He arrived at Steele's home off N.C. 105 near the Avery-Watauga County line about 10 p.m. Jan. 9.

Wilson said Steele came to the front door holding a semi-automatic handgun. Investigators said the officer ordered Steele to drop the gun three times, but that Steele pointed the gun at the officer.

Wilson said the officer shot him twice, including a wound to the abdomen that eventually led to his death.

"It is always a tragedy when someone dies under these circumstances," Wilson said. "It is also a tragedy that the officer, no matter how justified in his actions, will live the rest of his life with the memory of these events."
