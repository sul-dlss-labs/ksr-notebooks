North Little Rock police shot and wounded a man on Saturday night after a report of a disturbance shortly before 10:30 p.m. at the Rose City Police Substation located at 4609 E. Broadway, according to a news release from the Police Department sent early Sunday morning.

Also, the department reported that a man who was shot by officers on May 28 died on June 1.

The Saturday night encounter with the man resulted in officers firing their weapons, the release said.

The man was hit and officers provided medical attention before an ambulance transported the man to the hospital.

An officer fired at Smith, wounding him.

The Police Department reported the following day that Smith was in critical condition at the hospital.
