One person is dead and a Kentucky State Police trooper is injured following an overnight altercation in Bath County.

Dwayne Martin, 34, of Sharpsburg, died, according to the Bath County Coroner. A preliminary investigation indicates he died of a gunshot wound.

It happened around 10:30 Sunday night on Bethel Ridge Road, north of Sharpsburg. Kentucky State Police say when Trooper Jason Brown spotted 34-year-old Dwayne Martin, Martin charged him with a knife. They say Brown shot Martin, and Martin stabbed the trooper in the arm. A second trooper, Thurman Paige, fired his gun, killing Martin.

A neighbor said he saw a trooper in his backyard with a flashlight, and then saw him chasing after someone. Soon after, the man says he heard gunshots.

"By the time I got almost to the window I heard two shots, and when I looked out and seen the flashlight over there, the officer fired a third shot and that's when I seen the person fall," said neighbor Douglas Martin.

Trooper Scott Ferrell told WKYT that a trooper was taken to the University of Kentucky Chandler Hospital to be treated for cuts to the head and an arm.

Martin's family was on the scene shortly after the shooting. His father says his son wasn't a violent person.

"I've seen him sit in my house and put his arms out to handcuff him, to come and get him; never to bother nobody in his life. He was no criminal towards fighting and killing people, stabbing people. I don't know where that come from. I don't know if it's true," Irvine Martin said of his son.

The KSP Critical Response Team is investigating the shooting.
