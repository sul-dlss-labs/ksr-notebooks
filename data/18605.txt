Zhonghua Li, a 48-year-old Chinese man, died on Saturday, Dec. 24, after he was shot by deputies in the 3400 block of Greenglade Avenue in Pico Rivera, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Deputies were called to Li's residence about 4:45 p.m., according to L.A. County Sheriff’s Lt. Steve Jauch.

Family members had called 911 to report that Li had a history of mental illness and was arguing with family members and attacking them with a sharp object, Jauch said.

Li stabbed one of his family members in the hand, Jauch said, but the victim refused treatment. Others in the house included Li’s father, sister and brother-in-law, he said.

When deputies arrived, Li was standing in the street, holding the object in his hand, Jauch said. Li “walked aggressively” toward the deputies, one of whom tried to stop him by shooting him with a bean bag shotgun, Jauch said.

The bean bags hit Li in the torso, but he did not stop advancing, Jauch said. At that point, two deputies opened fire, striking Li. He was pronounced dead at the scene at 5:06 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

Investigators said they found threading scissors near Li’s body after the shooting, Jauch said. Threading scissors are a special kind of scissors with short, sharp blades.
