NEW CASTLE, Ind. -- A New Castle man was shot and killed by police early Sunday morning after he shot an officer in the chest during a chase.

The incident started around 4:13 a.m. Sunday when New Castle police received a report of a man breaking into cars near K Avenue and Columbus Street.

Officers arrived and located the suspect, later identified as 24-year-old Jarred Burke. Police said Burke refused to stop and attempted to flee from police on a bicycle.

Burke was apprehended by a police K-9 behind a church in the 1700 block of Columbus Street.

New Castle police said as their officers ran up to call off the dog, Burke pulled a handgun and fired a shot at close range into the chest of one of the officers.

The officer then returned fire, striking Burke.

Both Burke and the officer were transported to Henry Community Health Hospital, where Burke later succumbed to his injuries.

The officer was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. Police said they believe the officer's protective vest prevented a possible fatal wound.
