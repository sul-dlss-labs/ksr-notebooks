MULLINS, SC (WMBF) Authorities have identified the man killed during an exchange of bullets with police in Mullins Friday afternoon.

City of Mullins administrator Kenneth Davis tells WMBF News that one individual is deceased after an exchange of gunfire with several City of Mullins police officers. Davis says Police first responded to an incident on Gause Street shortly after lunch time Friday where the suspect began firing shots at the officers.

Officers fired back, and the suspect fled the residence on Gause Street toward Mullins Street where he was shot and killed.

None of the four or five officers involved were injured, and Davis says the State Law Enforcement Division is investigating the incident.

SLED's crime scene and investigative units were on the scene to uncover the details about what lead to the exchange of gunfire, Davis said.

Marion County Coroner Jerry Richardson has identified man killed as Malcolm Smith. Richardson said that his body has been sent to Charleston for an autopsy.

Gause Street resident Peggy Lewis says bullets barely missed her son playing outside during the exchange of gunfire.

"My son held his head down and a bullet went across," Lewis said. "There was shooting everywhere."

Smith's grandmother, Patricia Jackson says she and her family watched Smith die in the street right in front of their home on Mullins Street, and now hopes SLED will take a hard look at the events leading to her grandsons death.

"I'm all torn up inside, it's hard for me to talk about it," Jackson said. "It didn't have to be this way."

Davis says he believes police acted properly when they shot and killed Smith Friday, and he believes SLED's investigation into the incident will prove it.
