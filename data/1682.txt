Alcohol was involved in Troy Mills teen’s death

An autopsy reveals a Troy Mills teenager was very drunk when he drown in the Wapsipinicon River in Linn County last week. The body of 17-year-old Jason Limkemann was found by family members near the roller dam outside town. Authorities searched the same area earlier but the search was called off after nothing was found. Limkemann was missing since May 10th when he fled from sheriff’s deputies after being confronted outside a Troy Mills bar. A medical examiner says Limkemann had a blood-alcohol level of point-262, which is more than two-and-a-half times over the legal limit.
