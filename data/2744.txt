Authorities have identified the man killed Sunday in a high-speed pursuit on La Palma Avenue as Omar Medina Mendez, 25, of Santa Ana.

Police said Mendez was a parolee and the subject of a no-bail warrant in connection with several drug violations and resisting arrest and probably would have been returned to prison immediately if caught.

Police tried to pull Mendez over for driving 20 mph in a 50 mph zone. Instead, he accelerated and fled. After running several red lights at speeds up to 100 mph, he struck another vehicle and then a pole, police said. He died at the scene.
