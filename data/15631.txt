MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- A St. Paul man died Sunday after sustaining a head injury in Brooklyn Center, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's office.

Sinthanouxay Khottavongsa, 57, sustained the injury on the night of Jan. 16 near a Pizza Hut in Brooklyn Center.

Police were dispatched to the 5900 block of Xerxes Avenue North at about 9:12 p.m. on a report of a group fighting with weapons in a parking lot.

Officers arrived to find several people in front of the Pizza Hut, and Khottavongsa was holding a crowbar.

Police say they used a Taser on Khottavongsa after he refused to drop the weapon, which caused him to fall and hit his head on the ground.

He was taken to North Memorial Medical Center where he later died of complications from blunt force head injury, according to the medical examiner.

The Hennepin County Sheriff's Office is investigating.
