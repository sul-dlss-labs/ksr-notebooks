KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The FBI confirms a man took his life when he showed up at a Northland home on Tuesday and saw that agents were there.

The FBI was conducting an investigation at the home in the 6000 block of North Cosby Court, where a woman was found dead and a man injured on Monday, July 18.

On that day, police were called out at about 1:00 p.m., and found the victims. The female was declared dead and it initially appeared she took her own life. The male was taken to the hospital with an unknown medical condition.

On Tuesday, Aug. 2, two weeks after the incident, neighbors say FBI agents showed up at the house at about 7:45 a.m. A man reportedly showed up at the house during the FBI raid.

“The homeowner returned to the area and upon seeing a law enforcement presence inflicted himself with a gunshot wound,” said Eric Jackson, Special Agent in Charge, in a news release.

He was later indentified as Mark S. Sellers, 64.

The man was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but died from his injury.

This is a developing story and FOX 4’s coverage of it will continue unless we discover there is no criminal element to it and that both the man and woman took their lives. FOX 4 called the FBI to understand their involvement, but has not received an explanation on the reason for the investigation.
