A man was shot by a Jefferson County sheriff's deputy Saturday after lawmen were called to a home on a domestic assault.

The man, who was conscious and talking when he left the scene en route to UAB Hospital, died shortly after arrival at the hospital.

Sheriff's officials on Saturday night identified him as Jackie Harlan Roberts. He was 62 and had been staying at his sister's home where the incident occurred and the 911 call originated.

Deputies responded just after 12:30 p.m. to a home in the 4800 block of Vernon Parkway near Grayson Valley. Chief Deputy Randy Christian said they received a report that a 62-year-old man had assaulted his sister and husband at their home.

Roberts then went outside to his car and armed himself with a handgun.

Deputies arrived to find him sitting in the car with a gun in his hand. Roberts ignored commands to drop the weapon and began waiving it around. A deputy fired a single shot which struck the suspect in the shoulder.

Roberts was taken to the hospital with what authorities believed to be non-life-threatening injuries, but he died shortly after arrival at UAB Hospital.

"We are sad to report that we have received notification that the suspect in this case has died. He was awake and talking when transported from the scene,'' Christian said. "It is unknown if his death was a direct result of the gunshot injury or other health related issues."

He said the cause of death is pending the medical examiners report. "Our prayers are with the family as they deal with this loss and also with our involved personnel,'' he said.

The deputy wasn't injured. Christian said the victims had some bruises and other minor injuries and were shaken up but will be OK.

The State Bureau of Investigation is investigating, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings.
