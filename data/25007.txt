A registered sex offender who fled from a crash in Florida City led authorities in a chase across four counties that ended when he lost control of his car and fatally shot himself, WSVN is reporting.

Michael Sardinas of Hollywood shot himself on Florida’s Turnpike near Stuart, and was taken to the hospital, where he later died, the Miami TV station reported.

On Sunday, the man’s family said they believed he wanted police to shoot him, WSVN reported.

Sardinas’ father and stepmother said the right thing to do would have been for him to stay at the scene in Florida City after hitting that car, but they added he has just been released from prison and was scared of going back, according to the TV station.

“That’s what he wanted. Point blank, he wanted the cops to kill him,” said Martha Sardinas, his stepmother.

The drama began with a hit-and-run at U.S. 1 and Southwest 336th Street in Florida City on Saturday afternoon. As the gray Chevy sedan fled, the driver fired several shots at an officer and headed for the Turnpike, with police cars in hot pursuit.

Near mile marker 127 in Martin County, Sardinas spun out of control. Moments later, he turned his gun on himself.

Sardinas, who was 28 or 29, had recently been released from prison on felony charges, WSVN reported.
