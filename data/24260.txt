The Fresno County Sheriff’s Office says the man who was shot and killed in Dinuba last night is 39-year-old Ricardo Cisneros Piceno.

Investigators say Piceno was driving recklessly through Tulare and Fresno County and then came into contact with an off-duty Orange Cove Police Officer who saw him driving around 8pm last night.

“Approaching people very confrontational to them for no reason they were really caught off guard for what this was coming from,” said Tony Botti with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies say the suspect was driving west bound down Floral before encountering the off-duty officer at Monson ave.

They say the police officer saw Piceno driving and pulled over to let him pass…exactly what happened after that is unclear. But at some point they ended up on the side of a rural road.

“The suspect approached him that’s when he felt he was in danger,” stated Botti.

The officer was driving his personal vehicle when he saw Piceno driving erratically.

The sheriff’s department, which is investigating the shooting, says the officer did identify himself as law enforcement prior to the shooting.

Deputies do not know if drugs or alcohol were involved, or if the suspect had a weapon in his car.
