CHICAGO â€” A 20-year-old man who was shot in the arm by a police officer has been charged with pointing the gun at the officer and firing it at a 14-year-old girl, police said.

Jermaine Meeks of the 1600 block of South Komensky Avenue was listed in serious condition in Mt. Sinai Hospital on Sunday, according to a nursing supervisor.

A Marquette District tactical officer who was conducting a traffic stop Saturday afternoon heard a shot fired near 16th Street and Komensky Avenue, said police spokesman Matthew Jackson.

From the doorway of his second-floor apartment of a two-flat building, Meeks allegedly fired a single shot toward a 14-year-old resident of the first floor, police said. The girl was not injured.

Meeks allegedly ran to the back of the building and was confronted by the officer, Jackson said.

The officer identified himself and told Meeks to drop his weapon, but Meeks raised his gun to a firing position and was shot by the officer, Jackson said.

Police officials ruled the shooting was justified but would not release his name.
