UPDATE:

Grand Island Police tell Local4 that the incident was indeed a non criminal related suicide.

The Hall County Attorney's Office has also confirmed that it will not go to a grand jury.

Grand Island Police tell Local4 they had several roads blocked off in the northwest part of town due to the serving of a welfare check that led to a suicidal shooting.

Capt. Dean Elliott with GIPD said just before 6 p.m. Thursday, they had located the vehicle of a person they had been in search of. When the officer approached the vehicle in question, that's when they say a man fired his gun, leading to his death.

As of 8 p.m. Thursday, GIPD still had North Diers Avenue blocked off north of Capital Avenue. Capt. Elliott also said this case may need to be presented to a grand jury in Hall County because of the heavy police presence GIPD had for several hours.
