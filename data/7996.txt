CLINTON, LA (WAFB) - The East Feliciana sheriff's deputy who was injured in a crash Friday night has died due to a complication.

Deputy Richard Stiles Jr. was moved from intensive care Tuesday, but hours later a blood clot claimed his life.

The deputy's patrol car was hit by a pickup truck on Plank Road just south of Clinton. State police say the driver slammed on his brakes to avoid hitting another truck waiting to make a turn. He then veered into the deputy's path.

Marques Blakes of Clinton also died in the crash.
