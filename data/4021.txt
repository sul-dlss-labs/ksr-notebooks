Shreveport police have issued an arrest warrant for the man accused of causing a crash that left two people dead Friday morning. 23-year-old Keith Rogers of Bossier City is wanted for two counts of felony hit-and-run, police said. Authorities said more charges are possible.

Officers say Rogers was trying to flee police when he crashed his truck into a car at an intersection, causing the car to flip several times and burst into flames. The car hit a home that also caught fire. Two people inside the car were killed.



Shreveport police spokeswoman Kacee Hargrave says an officer noticed a truck had passed through a neighborhood several times. The officer started to turn around to attempt to stop the driver, the spokeswoman said. Hargrave says the driver of the truck sped off and crashed into a car near the intersection of Lakeshore Drive and San Jacinto Avenue. The driver of the truck fled the area.
