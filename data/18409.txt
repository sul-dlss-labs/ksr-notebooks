In her first review of an officer-involved shooting since taking office in January, Denver District Attorney Beth McCann determined that no charges would be filed against three police officers because the suspect fired his gun first and shot an officer in the face.

Aurora Police Department Sgt. Cassidee Carlson, Aurora officer Steven Edwards and Denver Police Department Officer Jimmy Shepherd were justified in shooting and killing Juan Ramos in November, McCann wrote in a letter explaining her decision.

Police were attempting to apprehend Ramos on Nov. 8 outside his home on the 14000 block of East 46th Avenue because he had been identified as a suspect in a fatal shooting 30 minutes before the encounter, the letter said. As they approached Ramos’ home, they saw him in the driveway where he was loading an infant into his car.

Ramos raised a .40-caliber handgun and began firing. A bullet struck Aurora officer Eric Ortiz, who was driving a Ford F-150 carrying his department’s strategic response team, the letter said.

“The officers did not fire their weapons before Ramos shot Officer Ortiz,” McCann said in her letter.

The bullet entered Ortiz’s skull and shattered his cheekbone, the letter said. Doctors were unable to remove the bullet.

Ramos was hit by 11 bullets fired by the three officers, the letter said. Ramos had fired six rounds from his gun.

Investigators later determined that Ramos’ .40-caliber handgun was the same weapon used to kill Antonio Norwood in the 100 block of Delmar Circle.

During her 2016 election campaign, McCann promised to hold public meetings to discuss her decision in every police shooting. The public is invited to discuss the shooting and McCann’s decision at 6 p.m. Tuesday, May 16, at the Montbello Recreation Center, 15555 E. 53rd Ave., Denver.
