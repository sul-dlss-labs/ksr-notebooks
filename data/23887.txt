A man shot himself at a major intersection in Bellflower after Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies had approached him Tuesday morning, a witness said.

Authorities released few details immediately afterward, saying only that deputies were responding to a report of a suspicious person at the intersection of Lakewood and Artesia boulevards when they heard a gunshot.

Bystanders said an ambulance took the man from the scene.

Joe Dicorpo, who owns a liquor store at the intersection, said police were trying to approach the man who kept walking to different street-corners to avoid them.

“They got more and more cops,” Dicorpo said.

Dicorpo said he’d spoken to the man earlier that morning and didn’t realize he had a gun.

It’s unclear if authorities knew the man had a gun. When deputies backed away for a moment, the man shot himself not long before 8:30 a.m, Dicorpo said.
