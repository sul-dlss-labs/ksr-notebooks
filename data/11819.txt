Two officers from The Dalles Police Department acted in self-defense when they fatally shot a 50-year-old man wielding an 8-inch-long knife last week, authorities said.

Wasco County District Attorney Eric Nisley announced Friday that an investigation found Officer Steven Rue, 36, and Officer Christopher Simonds, 35, were justified in shooting Gerald Arthur Stowell, Jr., on Sept. 17, at a home in the 700 block of Hostetler Street. No criminal charges will be brought against the officers.

Police were called to the home last week to investigate a possible rape and found a woman in the residence who claimed to have been sexually assaulted on multiple occasions by Stowell, Nisley said.

The woman was taken to the hospital for an examination leaving Rue, a 10-year police veteran, and Simonds, an officer for nine years, in the home with Stowell and his wife.

Simonds asked Stowell if there was a firearm in the home, which upset the homeowner, Nisley said. Stowell grew even more angry when the officers asked him to go with them to the police station for an interview.

Stowell eventually agreed to go, Nisley said, and then went to the bathroom. After leaving the bathroom, the officers said they saw Stowell go into the kitchen and he reappeared with the knife. Nisley said the officers told Stowell to put the knife down and they opened fire on the man when he did not comply. Stowell was hit five times, said the report, with six shots fired between the two officers.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene. Rue and Simonds were put on paid administrative leave during the investigation.
