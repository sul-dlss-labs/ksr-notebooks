October 14, 2020 - Houston police are investigating the fatal shooting of a female and the apparent suicide of a male at 10418 Broadstairs Street about 12:30 a.m. on Tuesday (October 13).



The identities of the male and female are pending verification by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.



HPD Homicide Division Detectives B. Rothberg and A. Barr reported:



HPD patrol officers responded to a report of a shooting inside a residence at the above address. Responding officers made contact with a male inside the residence and attempted to have him come outside so they could conduct a welfare check. The male refused and barricaded himself inside the residence. HPD SWAT and Hostage Negotiations teams responded to the scene.



After several hours of unsuccessful negotiations, the SWAT team made entry to the residence and found the female deceased from an apparent gunshot wound. The male was also found deceased from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.



The investigation is continuing.
