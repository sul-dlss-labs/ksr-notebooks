Lakewood police early Sunday morning shot and killed the man suspected of an armed robbery at a Longmont bank on Saturday.

Thomas Charles Snyder, 52, was shot by two members of the West Metro SWAT team at a motel in Wheat Ridge, according to a Lakewood police press release.

The SWAT team was called to the American Motel at about 1 a.m., according to the release, and spent about two hours trying to talk Snyder into leaving his room.

After his continued refusals, officers entered the room at about 3 a.m. and found Syder armed with a handgun, according to the release. After he ignored multiple commands to drop the gun, the two officers shot him, according to police. Snyder was pronounced dead at the scene.

Both officers were placed on leave while the Jefferson County Critical Incident Team investigates the shooting.

Snyder is believed to have entered Longmontâ€™s Bank of the West, located at Fifth Avenue and Coffman Street, around 11:45 a.m. Saturday. After brandishing a weapon, he fled the bank with an undisclosed amount of money, according to Longmont police.

Snyder was seen driving a white 2019 Kia Optima, which was stolen from Enterprise Sales in Thornton earlier on Saturday, according to police.

Snyder also had an active warrant for his arrest for a parole violation for escape, on an original charge of robbery, according to police.
