Joliet Police were involved in an officer shooting last evening in the 800-block of Second Avenue. At 6:30 last night, Joliet police were called for someone threatening to shoot people. Upon arrival, three uniformed JPD Officers in marked squad cars encountered the suspect, 19-year-old Joseph Casten of Naperville, in the street brandishing what appeared to be a black semi-automatic handgun. Mr. Casten aimed this apparent handgun at Officers and was subsequently shot multiple times. Officers on the scene quickly attempted to render life saving measures.

During the post-shooting investigation, the apparent black semi-automatic handgun was discovered to be a BB gun. It was also learned after the shooting that Mr. Casten was the 911 caller reporting a person in the street threatening to shoot people. The Joliet Fire Department (JFD) transported Mr. Casten to Silver Cross Hospital where he was pronounced deceased. The Officers involved in the incident were transported to Saint Joseph Medical Center for evaluation. No Officers were injured.

The Will-Grundy Major Crimes Task Force is investigating.
