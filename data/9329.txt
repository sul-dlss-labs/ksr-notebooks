The Scott County Sheriff’s Department is reviewing the death of a Princeton, Iowa, man who experienced stroke-like symptoms while waiting in the jail booking area Friday night.

Maj. Mike Brown said Gregg Alan Kindelsperger, 51, was brought to the jail by Princeton police for traffic violations and became ill while waiting to be booked into the jail.

Kindelsperger was not handcuffed at the time and was cooperative with police, Brown said. He was transported by ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to Iowa City, where he died Saturday, the major said.

Brown said it wasn’t clear what was wrong with Kindelsperger but described his illness as stroke-like symptoms.

“It’s unfortunate,” Brown said. “This man must have become way more sick after he was taken to the hospital.”

Brown said the sheriff’s department will conduct an internal investigation and review incident reports to ensure the situation was handled properly.

A similar incident occurred at the Rock Island County Jail in April 2009, when a man became unresponsive while waiting to be booked.

Darryl D. Mason, 42, of East Moline, was arrested by Rock Island police for being disruptive while attending an event at the QCCA Expo Center. After he fell unconscious at the jail, he was taken to a local hospital and died a short time later.

Rock Island County State’s Attorney Jeff Terronez reviewed an investigation conducted by the Rock Island County Integrity Task Force and found no criminal charges were warranted in the case.

An autopsy determined that Mason died from the adverse effects of cocaine.
