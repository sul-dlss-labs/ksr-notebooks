NLV man killed by police amid standoff is identified

A North Las Vegas man who was killed by police Tuesday after officials say he held his children and their mother hostage and fired at officers has been identified as 26-year-old Donaven Kyle Anderson, according to the Clark County Coroner's Office.

Anderson's official cause and manner of death have not yet been released by the Coroner's Office.

North Las Vegas Police responded about 5:10 p.m. Tuesday to a house in the 100 block of Spur Ranch Avenue, near Alexander Road and Commerce Street, after receiving a call about a person with a gun in a domestic disturbance, Officer Aaron Patty said.

Anderson, who lived at the house with the 34-year-old mother of his children, her 74-year-old father and the three kids, had threatened to shoot police officers and people in the house, police said.

SWAT was called and Anderson exited the front door with a shotgun, police said.

Following an "exchange of gunfire" between officers and Anderson, Anderson was pronounced dead on scene, police said.

Two SWAT officers, ages 35 and 40, were struck by gunfire from Anderson's weapon and taken to University Medical Center with nonlife-threatening injuries before being released that night, police said.

One of the injured officers and another officer, both of whom fired at the suspect, have been placed on routine paid administrative leave, police said.
