Officers shot and killed a 25-year-old Chicago man on the Northwest Side Monday night after he allegedly wrested a gun from an officer and pointed it at them, police said.

John Fuentes, of the 2600 block of North Monitor Avenue, was pronounced dead in an alley in the 4800 block of West Homer Street, police spokesman Hector Alfaro said.

At about 10:40 p.m., two Grand Central District officers had spotted a Ford Explorer weaving erratically and honking its horn on Grand Avenue near Cicero Avenue, Alfaro said.

The officers followed the Explorer in a squad car as it traveled west on Grand, and a passenger got out of the SUV and ran off. Moments later, Fuentes, the SUV's driver, stopped abruptly, causing the squad car to rear-end it, Alfaro said.

Fuentes jumped out and ran. An officer ran after him while her partner arrested at least two passengers in the Explorer.

After the officer chased Fuentes through an alley, her partner heard a gunshot and called for backup, Alfaro said.

Grand Central District officers saw Fuentes on top of the officer "with the officer's gun in his hand," Alfaro said. Fuentes pointed the gun at them, and the officers fired, he said.
