Two people were killed Thursday night, Aug. 29, when a car pursued by police slammed into another vehicle, sending another three people who had been in the vehicles to a hospital in critical condition.

At about 8:50 p.m. officers saw a red Acura Integra drive through a red traffic light near White Avenue and Arrow Highway, La Verne police said. They tried to stop the vehicle but the driver sped northbound on White from First Street, prompting the pursuit.

The Acura traveled for a little under a mile when it hit a black Toyota Corolla carrying two people near White Avenue and College Lane, police said.

“The driver of the red car was speeding up White (Avenue), going northbound, and T-boned the black car,” a witness identified only as Nathan told ABC7. “I guess there was a chase that was just starting.”

La Verne firefighters took the two people in the Toyota and three critically injured people in the Acura to a hospital, while the drivers of both cars were pronounced dead.

The Toyota’s driver was identified as Marlet Reyes, 68, of La Verne. The name of the Acura driver and the three other injured people were not disclosed.

The crash was being investigated by the California Highway Patrol.

Anyone who witnessed the crash was asked to call the La Verne Police Department at 909-596-1913.
