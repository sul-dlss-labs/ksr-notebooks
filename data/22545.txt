GARY | Police shot and killed a man who they said pulled a knife while they were attempting to serve a warrant Friday afternoon.

Jonathan Johnson, 29, of the 700 block of North Henry Street, died of a gunshot wound to the chest, said PJ Adams, chief deputy coroner at the Lake County coroner's office.

Gary police Lt. Sam Roberts said officers attempted to serve a city warrant on George Barnes, 56, at 3400 E. 12th Ave., about 12:30 p.m. Barnes was wanted for driving without a license, police said.

Roberts said Johnson tossed a bag outside after cracking open the door when police knocked. Johnson opened the door a second time, attempted to pull a knife and was shot by police, Roberts said.

Barnes was arrested in connection with maintaining a common nuisance, police said. Three others, Darrion Jackson, 21, Erick Thomas, 36, and Valerie Moore, 18, were arrested in connection with visiting a common nuisance, police said.

Jackson also had an outstanding warrant for driving without a license, Roberts said.

Roberts said the building was a known drug house, and drugs were found inside.

The two officers who served the warrant have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure when officers are involved in a shooting.
