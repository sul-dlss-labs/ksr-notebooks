A child pornography raid turned deadly at a Pennsylvania home Friday morning.

Police said the FBI went to the home specifically to execute a search warrant related to a child porn ring in Delaware County, FBI sources told NBC10's Monique Braxton.

"As they executed the search warrant, shots were fired," said Chester Police Commissioner Joseph Bail.

One of the four people in the home was shot and killed during the exchange of gunfire, authorities said.

The FBI were responding to a home on Highland Avenue near 6th Street in Chester to execute the search warrant around 6 a.m., said Bail.

As NBC Philadelphia's Chopper, SkyForce10, hovered overhead local and federal investigators could be seen responding to the home and a neighboring home before police eventually took a man from the home and into a waiting police car. Investigators questioned that man, a woman and a third person taken from the home.

The relationship between the people in the home wasn't immediately clear.

Neighbors were surprised by the sound of gunshots coming from the home where they said the residents mostly kept to themselves.

The home—which had a sophisticated security system— was one of three that were raided Friday as part of the federal inquiry, said authorities.

The FBI and Delaware County special prosecutors will investigate the incident, said Bail.
