DeKalb County police Tuesday identified the carjacking suspect shot and killed by an off-duty officer last week as 39-year-old Ahaviel Whitfield.

An off-duty DeKalb officer was working security at a shopping plaza on Rainbow Way in south DeKalb about 8:30 p.m. Thursday when an armed man approached a woman from behind and attempted to steal her vehicle, police said.

The victim got the attention of the officer, who found Whitfield in the woman’s vehicle, approached him and ordered him to drop his handgun.

Whitfield instead pointed the gun at the officer, and was shot and killed, police said.

The officer’s name has not been released.
