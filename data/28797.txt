A driver pursued by a Riverside County sheriff’s deputy died Wednesday morning after crashing into another vehicle at a Moreno Valley intersection, authorities said.

The deputy, riding a motorcycle, attempted to stop the driver of a Jeep who appeared to possibly be under the influence in the area of Heacock Street and Dracaea Avenue, the Sheriff’s Department said.

After the deputy flashed the cycle’s emergency lights, the Jeep’s driver continued driving and the chase started.

The pursuit continued for about three miles south to Indian Avenue and Krameria Avenue, where the driver of the Jeep zoomed through a stop sign and crashed into a Hyundai Santa Fe mini SUV, authorities said.

The collision caused the Jeep to overturn, killing the driver, the department said.

The driver and passenger of the Hyundai were hospitalized for injuries but were released later on Wednesday.
