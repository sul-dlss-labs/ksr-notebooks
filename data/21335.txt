LAWTON – A Lawton police officer was justified when he shot and killed a 34-year-old Galesburg man last month during a traffic stop on M-40, authorities said.

“He has been cleared by the Van Buren County Prosecutor’s Office,” Michigan State Police 1st Lt. Chuck Christensen said of Lawton Police Officer Scott Hitchcock. “The report was reviewed by (Prosecutor) Juris Kaps and he found that the actions were justified.”

Hitchcock, a 12-year veteran of the Lawton Police Department, shot and killed Michael Lyle Adams Jan. 25 in the 600 block of M-40. State police investigators said Adams brandished a handgun and assault rifle at Hitchcock after Hitchcock tried to stop Adams’ Saturn sedan for an equipment violation at about 3 a.m.

Police said Adams pulled his car into the driveway of a house on M-40 and got out of his vehicle as Hitchcock was exiting his cruiser.

Police said Adams brandished a 9 mm handgun when he got out of the car, prompting Hitchcock to draw his weapon and fire, striking Adams.

Adams then retrieved a 7.62-caliber SKS assault rifle from his car and told three passengers in the vehicle that he was not going to be arrested. After Adams had gotten the assault rifle, Hitchcock fired again, fatally wounding Adams.

An autopsy performed Jan. 26 showed Adams was wounded four times.

Hitchcock and three women inside Adams’ car were not hurt during the incident.
