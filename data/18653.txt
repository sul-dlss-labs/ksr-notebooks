SEWANEE, Tenn. (WKRN) – A man from the Antioch neighborhood of Nashville died Thursday after he was shot by officers in Sewanee, Tennessee.

The shooting happened shortly before 2 p.m. down Deepwoods Road off Fire Tower Road not far from St. Andrew’s-Sewanee School, which was placed on lockdown as a precaution.

According to authorities at the scene, the Antioch man, identified as 40-year-old Randy Wayne Cole, called 911 and said he was either going to kill himself or have an officer kill him.

Six officers responded to the scene and TBI spokesman Josh DeVine said they attempted to negotiate with Cole for a short time before the incident escalated.

Cole reportedly fired shots at the officers, prompting five of the six to fire back. The names of those five officers have not been released, but the TBI says it was two deputies with the Franklin County Sheriff’s Office, an officer with the Sewanee Police Department, and two officers with the Monteagle Police Department.

Cole was hit at least once and taken to Sewanee’s hospital where he died a short time later.

Sewanee is located on Monteagle Mountain about 90 miles southeast of Nashville off Interstate 24.
