PERRY, Iowa (AP) -- A teenager was killed during a police chase when a suspect's pickup collided with her vehicle, authorities said.

Teresa Fagen, 15, of rural Perry, was killed in the crash at about 9:45 p.m. on Friday, according to a news release from the Perry Police Department.

Joseph P. Long, 35, of Perry, was being held in Dallas County Jail on charges of attempting to elude a police officer, expired driver's license, no insurance, improper passing and other charges.

The Iowa State Patrol was investigating, and police said other charges were pending.

Authorities said that shortly before the collision, Long was observed driving his 2004 red Dodge pickup in a wreckless manner, including pulling out of parking lot without turning on his headlights, going into a ditch and spinning on the snow-covered ground.

When an officer tried to stop Long's vehicle, Long pulled over. However, when the officer exited the patrol car, Long accelerated, police said.

Authorities said the officer pursued Long, whose pickup collided with Fagen's vehicle a couple of miles down the road.
