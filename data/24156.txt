A fatal police shooting near a midtown Circle K is drawing the attention of some Tucson demonstrators.

About a dozen people gathered at the convenience store on Wednesday night to protest the fatal police shooting in Tucson earlier this week. A few people placed candles on the sidewalk and held signs that read "Who did the police kill here yesterday?" and "His Name was Charles Hutchison."

Posts on social media showed that the signs were still up near the Circle K on Thursday morning.

On Tuesday afternoon, Tucson police shot and killed 37-year-old Charles Hutchison. The incident began just after 1 p.m. when a 911-caller reported a man was standing in the intersection of East Grant Road and North Alvernon Way with a knife and threatening motorists, said Sgt. Pete Dugan, a police spokesman.

"The man would walk up to vehicles yelling that he was going to stab someone," said Dugan.

Two patrol officers arrived and approached the man in the intersection, and both officers saw that the man had a knife, said Dugan.

The man ran toward the Circle K on the southwest corner of the intersection and the two officers followed, commanding him to drop the knife, Dugan said.

The man started running closer to the doors of the convenience store, and one of the officer's used his Taser on the man. The other officer, Raul Navarro, then fired multiple times, striking the man, Dugan said.

The man ran through the parking lot before being tackled by one of the officers, Dugan said.
