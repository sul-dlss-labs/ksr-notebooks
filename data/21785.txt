DEKALB COUNTY, Ga. — Police have identified a man killed when he opened fire on officers at a DeKalb County apartment complex.

The incident happened around 11:30 p.m. Wednesday along Maple Walk Circle in Decatur.

Georgia Bureau of Investigation says 27-year-old Quintas Harris suffered from mental health problems. Witnesses told Channel 2's Steve Gehlbach that Harris was a disabled vet with paranoid schizophrenia.

Channel 2's Sophia Choi had just spoken to Harris during an unrelated story a few weeks ago.

The GBI report says Harris fired at two men just before officers showed up Wednesday night.

The police chief told Channel 2's Darryn Moore that when officers arrived, Harris ran away and tried to get into a car.

Three more officers arrived at the scene, and police said Harris started shooting at them and they shot back.

Reggie Walker, a witness, said he heard officers shouting to Harris to “put down the gun.”

“I heard the shot and looked back up,” Walker said. “By that time, all I seen was the police shooting. From my understanding, what they told me, the first shot was when he shot them, that’s why they returned fire.”

Harris was shot by four different officers, according to police.

“During the exchange of gunfire one officer was struck in the hand. The suspect was struck multiple times,” the chief said.

The GBI said Harris died Thursday morning.

Officers said they found several weapons at the scene.
