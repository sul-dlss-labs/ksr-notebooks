The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is investigating an officer-involved shooting that happened Wednesday near Geary, about 25 miles west of El Reno.

Around 4:28 p.m. Wednesday, the Geary Police Department requested the OSBI investigate the shooting, which occurred at Interstate 40 and the State Highway 281 on-ramp.

Authorities said a Geary police officer saw a 46-year-old man holding a knife. The officer stopped to talk to the man and ordered him to put down the knife, authorities said.

The man allegedly did not comply.

A second officer, who was off-duty, stopped to help. Authorities said attempts were made to de-escalate the situation but the man would not put the knife down.

A third officer arrived and attempted to deploy his Taser but “could not get a clear shot,” according to an OSBI news release.

OSBI said when the man saw the Taser, “he lunged at the off-duty officer with the knife and one shot was fired.”

Officers attempted to render aid but the man died before medics arrived, authorities said.

The man’s name was not released pending notification of next-of-kin.

The OSBI said upon completing the investigation, a report will be submitted to the district attorney’s office. The district attorney will determine if charges should be filed.

The OSBI does not release the names of the officers involved unless the district attorney determines charges should be filed, the agency said.

The Geary Police Department declined to give any more details about the shooting, citing the ongoing investigation.
