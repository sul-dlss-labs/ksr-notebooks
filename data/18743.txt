The name of the second woman killed when a police chase ended in a crash early Sunday has now been released.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office on Tuesday identified the victim as Amanda Lynn Hill Pigg. She was 37, and lived in Bessemer.

The crash happened about 2:40 a.m. Sunday. Bessemer police Sgt. Cortice Miles said officers made a traffic stop at the intersection of 16th Street and 7th Avenue North. When police approached the vehicle, the driver fled at a high rate of speed.

Police caught up to the Honda at the intersection of 9th Avenue and 19th Street North, as a Ford SUV crashed into the fleeing car.

Stacie Carroll Williams, who was a passenger in the Honda's back seat, was thrown from the vehicle. She was pronounced dead on the scene at 2:43 a.m.

Pigg, also a passenger in the Honda, was taken to UAB Hospital, where she was pronounced dead at 5:46 a.m. Coroner's officials were able to locate and notify her family Tuesday morning.

The Honda's driver, whose name has not yet been released, was taken to Princeton Baptist Medical Center, and was listed Sunday in stable condition. Miles said investigators expect to charge him with two counts of felony murder for the crash, along with other charges.

The driver of the Ford was not visibly injured, but she was taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation.
