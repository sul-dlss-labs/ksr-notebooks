Police say a man killed himself in a city park after he was approached by police.

The incident occurred around 7:30 p.m. Tuesday at North Canton Rotary Park at 904 Applegrove St. NW.

Police got a call from a male — possibly from the man police later encountered — about gunshots being fired at the park, according to Police Chief Stephan Wilder.

Patrolman Cody Dollinger was in the area and found a man sitting at a park picnic table.

As the officer tried to speak to the man, the man pulled a gun and shot himself in the head, Wilder said.

Dollinger took quick action by calling paramedics and tried to render first aid, but the man could not be saved, Wilder said.

The Stark County Coroner’s office pronounced the man dead of a self-inflicted gunshot. The man was later identified as a 52-year-old Plain Township resident.

Suicides in a public area are not common but “occurrences like this do happen in our community as well as the rest of the United States,” Wilder said.

There are a number of agencies that offer help for those feeling lonely, despondent or depressed, he said.

“Just a very. very unfortunate incident” for the man’s family, Wilder said, and traumatic for the officer.

Wilder has discussed the incident with Dollinger and the officer has resumed his regular duties.
