A police pursuit that ended in a car crash last week has claimed a second victim, 19-year-old Jennifer Ho, who died in a hospital Saturday from her injuries.

The crash occurred Thursday when a man fleeing from police in a stolen pickup truck struck the Volkswagen that Ho was driving, killing her mother, 48-year-old Chau Ho of Rosemead.

The collision occurred near Peck Road and Durfee Avenue, said Lt. Santos Hernandez of the El Monte Police Department.
