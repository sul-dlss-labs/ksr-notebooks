A man who was fatally shot Christmas Day by a Riverside County sheriff's deputy after he attempted to take the deputy's baton during a struggle in Coachella was identified Friday.

Dead is Omar Rodriguez, 35, of Coachella, according to sheriff's Sgt. Mike Manning, a department spokesman.

Manning said Rodriguez was on parole for a previous conviction of resisting arrest and attempting to take a law enforcement officer's firearm at the time of the shooting.

The incident occurred at about 11:30 a.m. Thursday in the 83-600 block of Shadowrock Drive in the Bella Canto neighborhood in Coachella.

According to a Riverside County Sheriff's Department news release, the deputy shot Rodriguez because he attacked her, then tried to wrestle her police baton out of her hands.

Rodriguez was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he died, officials said, adding that the deputy was not injured.

The deputy was initially called to the neighborhood to investigate a report of someone entering a house and attacking a homeowner. When the deputy arrived at the house, she saw the suspect standing in the roadway, where he assumed a "fighting stance," according to the news release.

"The officer ordered the suspect to stop several times, however, he aggressively continued toward her," the news release stated. "The officer used her baton in an attempt to protect herself from the attacking suspect. A struggle for the officer's baton took place and an officer-involved shooting occurred."

The deputy was placed on paid administrative leave per department protocol. An investigation is ongoing, officials said.
