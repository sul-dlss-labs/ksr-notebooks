Marcus Smith, a 31-year-old black man, was shot multiple times by Inglewood police officers and killed on Sunday, May 17, in the 800 block of Osage Avenue in Inglewood, according to authorities.

Police officers said Smith brandished a weapon as they tried to break up a birthday party shortly after 12:45 a.m. Authorities said they were called to the party to break up a fight.

"He had it in his hand. He drew it and pointed it in the direction of the officers," Lt. Mike McBride said. "So I would say that's threatening the officers."

One officer was shot in the right leg in the incident. Authorities said they believed he was shot by Smith but said more tests were needed to be sure.

Kalonna LaCount, who identified herself as Smith's fiancee, disputed the police account. LaCount said she and Smith were leaving the party together after police called on guests to disperse when he slipped on a stairway.

"He had his hands in the air," she said. "The more he stumbled, the more they shot."

The shooting was the latest deadly incident involving Inglewood's Police Department, which is under investigation by two outside agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, over its use of deadly force.
