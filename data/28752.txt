The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation says Vernon Billy Stiles was killed during a confrontation with Spruce Pine police officers on Sunday, September 6th. Stile’s neighbor Chris Beam says that Stiles warned him earlier Sunday to get out of his apartment for his own safety. Beam said Stiles set a pile of clothes on fire in a room upstairs, so he told Stiles he had to call 911. Chris Beam lives in the duplex apartment next door to Stiles. He said he knew his neighbor had a criminal record but he didn’t feel in danger Sunday, even when Stiles threatened him with a butcher knife.

According to WLOS News, Beam said, “I wanted to talk him down. I just didn’t know how.” Beam went on to say that Spruce Pine police came to the duplex and went into the apartment. Beam said, “I heard one of the officers say, ‘Drop the knife! Drop the knife!’ Then I heard Bill say, ‘Noooo.’ And then I heard a pop, pop, pop.”

Beam said in the five months he knew him, Stiles had exhibited signs of paranoia, saying police would kill him. Beam also said Stiles had told him earlier Sunday that police would be coming for him.

Following the incident, the Spruce Pine Police Department requested an investigation by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation . Officers involved in the incident will be on administrative leave until the investigation is complete.
