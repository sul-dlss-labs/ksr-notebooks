A grand jury in Manhattan voted not to indict a plainclothes officer who shot and killed another officer he mistook for a criminal on a rainy street in East Harlem, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, announced on Thursday.

The decision means that Officer Andrew P. Dunton will not face criminal charges for firing at an off-duty officer, Omar J. Edwards, who had been chasing a man he had caught breaking into his car and had drawn his gun as the man dashed off.

Mr. Morgenthau also released a narrative of what led to the May 28 shooting, indicating that, after Officer Dunton shouted, “Drop the gun,” Officer Edwards pointed his weapon at him.

Officer Dunton still faces an internal Police Department review, which could lead to disciplinary measures.
