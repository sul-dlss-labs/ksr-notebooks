WEST BRANCH, Iowa (AP) - Two people were killed and an Iowa state trooper from Muscatine remained in serious condition this morning after a double accident one mile east of the West Branch exit.

Trooper Jeff Benson, who remains hospitalized at University Hospitals, Iowa City, had stopped to help the De Avila family. Their car had slid off the road, an Iowa State Patrol spokesman said.

Benson was helping the family to his patrol car when a semi, driven by Janice Mitchell, 41, of Pikeville, Tenn., overturned on both the patrol cruiser and the car in the ditch.

Benson, Geonia De Avila, 42, of Cicero, Ill, and her daughter, Lisa, 7, were walking on the right side of the patrol car when the trailer of the semi, which was eastbound on I-80, struck the patrol car, pushing it and all three pedestrians into the ditch alongside the vehicle.

The trailer came to rest on top of Benson's patrol car, pinning all three people under the car. Both mother and daughter were killed. The father, Felipe De Avila, 45, somehow was pushed out of the way of the accident and received only minor injuries.

Mitchell and her husband, James, 43, who also was in the truck, were not injured, authorities said.

Benson, 34, has served with the state patrol for 10 years and is assigned to the Davenport post.

His work as a trooper has been notable over the years. Last year, he and another trooper were recognized by Gov. Tom Vilsack for their roles in a state-wide drug interdiction incident unit.

In 1996, Benson found 36 Mexican nationals locked in the back of a U-Haul rental truck, which had been stopped because the front-seat occupants were not wearing seat belts.

Also in 1996, Benson was one of two troopers who found a stockpile of cocaine in a pickup truck on Interstate 80, the third largest cocaine seizure in Iowa history.

In 1992, after three boys led state troopers on a 36-mile chase in a stolen car, Benson's patrol car was struck by the stolen car in which the boys were traveling.
