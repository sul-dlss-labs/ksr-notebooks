ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) — A man suspected in a homicide case was found dead in a southwest Alaska home from an apparent gunshot wound following a nearly 24-hour standoff with Alaska State Troopers, officials said.

Troopers in an online statement identified the man as Devyn Walker, 34, of Holy Cross. A trooper discharged his or her weapon during the Wednesday evening incident. Circumstances surrounding Walker's death in the statement weren't clear, and troopers didn't immediately respond to a request for more information.

The Alaska Bureau of Investigations is investigating and will turn its findings over to the Alaska Office of Special Prosecutions. The trooper will not be identified for 72 hours following the incident.

The standoff began Monday when troopers from Bethel flew to Holy Cross after a reported shooting of a man in a boat. The victim was identified as Alden Gerald Walker Sr., 71, of Holy Cross. Troopers identified Devyn Walker as the suspect. He barricaded himself in a house and refused to surrender, troopers said. At one point, troopers said Devyn Walker fired a gun at them.

Troopers sent crisis negotiators and a special emergency reaction unit to Holy Cross. No troopers were injured.
