JOURDANTON, Texas â€“ A Jourdanton police officer shot and killed a man inside his mother's home Tuesday after they said he struck another officer, Jourdanton Police Chief Eric Kaiser said.

Kaiser said the man -- identified as 43-year-old Richard McClendon -- was "causing a disturbance" inside the home in the 600 block of Olive around 11:30 a.m.

When officers arrived, McClendon had barricaded himself inside a bathroom. Officer were told initially that he may have had a gun, Kaiser said.

McClendon eventually came out of the bathroom, armed with a knife, Kaiser said. An officer attempted to stop him with a stun gun, but McClendon charged at her and struck her.

Another officer then fired his gun at McClendon, Kaiser said, striking him in his torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

McClendon's elderly mother and another person were at the home during the incident, but they were uninjured, Kaiser said.

According to public records, this was not the first time McLendon had a run-in with the law. He was previously arrested for drug possession, driving while intoxicated and assaulting a peace officer.

"Officers have dealt with the individual several times over the last few years. Officer at our department as well as other neighboring departments. He had some very violent tendencies for some of those encounters," said Eric kaiser, Jourdanton Chief of Police.

The female officer who was hit is expected to recover. Jourdanton police and the Texas Rangers are investigating the incident.
