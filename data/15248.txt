Westminster weighs nation's first tobacco ban

WESTMINSTER — The cartons of Marlboros, cans of Skoal and packs of Swisher Sweets are hard to miss stacked near the entrance of Vincent's Country Store, but maybe not for much longer: All tobacco products could become contraband if local health officials get their way.

Coast Guard rescues 4 fishermen near Nantucket, escorts ship to New Bedford

NANTUCKET — Coast Guard crew members rescued four fishermen about 25 miles southeast of Nantucket after their boat started taking on water.

The Coast Guard says the crew aboard the 71-foot Olivia Catherine called authorities shortly before 5 a.m. Saturday after the fishing vessel started flooding.

Coast Guard members from Air Station Cape Cod flew out to the ship in a helicopter and lowered two water pumps to the fishermen, who used the pumps to keep the boat from sinking.

A Coast Guard rescue boat later met up with the Olivia Catherine and escorted the ship to New Bedford, where it arrived at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday.

It's not clear why the fishing boat started taking on water.
