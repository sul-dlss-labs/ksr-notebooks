Clackamas County authorities have identified the motorist fatally shot late Tuesday by a deputy as Shawn Devo Mosley -- a 48-year-old homeless man.

Mosley was shot by Deputy Robert Nashif, 34, a veteran officer who started his career in 1995 in Keizer and joined the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office in 1998.

Sgt. Lee Eby, a sheriff's spokesman, said Nashif pulled over Mosley's van just before 8:30 p.m. on Oregon 212 at Southeast Foster Road near the Damascus Fire Station. The van was missing a front license plate.

The deputy approached the van and asked Mosley for his license and registration, Eby said. The man gave the deputy some documents, then brandished a weapon.

"The deputy retreated and started yelling for the man to drop the gun,'' Eby said. But the man refused.

The man then pointed the gun at the deputy, who fired, striking the man, Eby said. Mosley fired his gun an unknown number of times. The deputy was not injured. Eby would not say how many times the deputy fired his weapon.

Eby this morning said Mosley, whose last known address was on Southeast McLoughlin Boulevard, had an outstanding warrant for his arrest for a probation violation on a public indecency charge in Clackamas County.

Eby said Nashif is a decorated officer with what he described as "an excellent personnel file." In 2005, he received a national award for his work in traffic safety.

Eby said Nashif is on paid administrative leave while the incident is under investigation.
