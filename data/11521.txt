Officers shot and killed a 26-year-old man after he pointed a rifle at them while they tried to arrest him on a felony warrant, according to a statement from Billings County.

Officers with the Dickinson Tactical Team attempted to serve an arrest warrant on Kyle Quackenbush at a residence in Billings County, north of Belfield, at about 4 p.m. Tuesday, according to a Friday statement from Billings County Stateâ€™s Attorney Jay V. Brovold.

Quackenbush was charged with Class C felony aggravated assault and a warrant was issued for his arrest after he allegedly strangled an unidentified person Tuesday until the person lost consciousness, according to a criminal complaint filed in Stark County.

A confrontation ensued between Quackenbush and the tactical team. Quackenbush aimed a rifle at officers, who responded by shooting him, the Billings County statement said. Emergency medical personnel pronounced Quackenbush dead at the scene.

The Dickinson police officer who shot Quackenbush has been placed on administrative leave, as is customary in these situations, according to the statement.

The North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation has been asked to conduct a review of the use of deadly force, which also is customary. The shooting is under investigation, according to the statement.

The Associated Press reported that homeowner Mike Burian said Quackenbush broke into his home early Tuesday, stole a gun, and was shot and killed by law officers about 12 hours later.

Quackenbush lived in Linton and was formerly of Dickinson. He was employed at Gross Farms in Napoleon.
