A Raleigh, North Carolina homicide suspect is dead after shooting himself when Pennsylvania State Police closed in on him after hours of searching Wednesday afternoon.

Just before 3 p.m., state police were notified of a suspect wanted on a homicide warrant out of North Carolina, Trooper Megan Ammerman said. Troopers found the suspect vehicle on Route 234 in Adams County and began a pursuit.

Ammerman said troopers deployed spike strips on Route 234, which stopped the vehicle, and the driver ran away on foot.

The driver has since been identified as 24-year-old Taylor Jeffrey Johnson, accused of attempted homicide, Ammerman said. It was unclear if the victim in the North Carolina incident had survived.

Police were able to shut down Route 15 and establish a perimeter, closing Route 234/Heidlersburg Road from Lake Meade Road to Old Harrisburg Road in Tyrone Township.

For most of the almost 5-hour search, the man was on foot, Ammerman said.

Around 7:30 p.m., Ammerman said officers encountered him, saw Johnson pull out his weapon and shoot himself. Despite treatment at the scene, Johnson died from his injuries.

Johnson had no other contact with officers or anyone else up to that point, and there were no other injuries reported, Ammerman said. During the search, the perimeter consisted mostly of wooded areas, but searchers did encounter other people who were not harmed.

No information on the North Carolina incident was available Tuesday night. Police were still investigating if he had any connection to Pennsylvania, Ammerman said. Johnson was in his early 20s.

The search was assisted by several local departments, the state police Special Emergency Response Team and the state police helicopter.
