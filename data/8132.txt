Wilford Hunton, an 18-year-old black man, was shot several times by police near the 710 Freeway and Willow Avenue in Long Beach on Wednesday, May 27, and died of his injuries the following day, authorities said.

Long Beach police detectives said they witnessed Hunton and two other men take part in a shooting in Compton, where they were conducting an unrelated investigation about 5 p.m. on May 27.

The detectives followed the three men.

"The suspects realized the detective units were following them and they opened fire, striking one of the detective vehicles multiple times. Thankfully none of the detectives were injured and they were able to continue following the suspects," according to a statement released by Long Beach police.

The detectives called for backup, then followed the men south, onto the 710 Freeway and then off at the Willow Street exit in Long Beach. At that point, Long Beach police officers attempted to stop the men.

"It was at that time that an officer-involved shooting occurred. Weapons were recovered at the scene. Three suspects were shot by officers and transported to local hospitals," Long Beach police officials said. One of the suspects died, police said.

Long Beach police did not immediately provide more specific details of the circumstances surrounding the shooting. An officer was also wounded in the shooting and homicide detectives said their preliminary investigation indicated the officer had been hit by police gunfire. He was treated at a hospital and released.

Anyone with more information about this incident is asked to call Long Beach Police Department Dets. Mark McGuire or Hugo Cortes at (562) 570-7244.
