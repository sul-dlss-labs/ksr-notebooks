The driver of a vehicle being chased by a Clark County Sheriff’s Department deputy died when the vehicle overturned numerous times early Wednesday morning. The man is identified as Shannon D. Melvin, 39, of Neillsville.

A passenger, Ana B. Hannon-Abraira, 36, of Neillsville, was severely injured.

According to Clark County Sheriff Greg Herrick:

At 1:11 a.m., the sheriff’s department received a report of a vehicle driving through yards near Grand Avenue and South Mound Road in the town of Pine Valley. The department was told the vehicle was going westbound on South Mound Road at a high rate of speed.

A deputy going eastbound on South Mound Road from County G saw a westbound vehicle.

As the vehicle approached the squad car the vehicle crossed the centerline, nearly striking the squad car. The deputy recognized the description of the vehicle matched that of the one that had been driving through years.

The deputy turned around, activated the squad’s lights and siren. The other vehicle went through a stop sign and then about three-quarters of a mile west of County G the vehicle entered the south ditch and overturned several times, before landing on its wheels.

The driver, Melvin, was killed instantly.
