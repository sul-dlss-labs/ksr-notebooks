An east Alabama homicide suspect is dead after authorities say he first fatally stabbed and shot his girlfriend and critically wounded her 4-year-old son.

The ordeal began at 1:02 p.m. Saturday when the Weaver Police Department received a call requesting a welfare check at the residence at 97 Juanita Lane in Jacksonville, said Weaver Police Chief Wayne Bush.

The caller reported that 21-year-year Alex Haynes, of Oxford, had confessed to his mother that he had killed his girlfriend at the Juanita Lane home.

When an officer arrived, he found what looked to be forced entry to a window on the rear door to the residence. Officers then made entry and found 24-year-old Katlynn Jones dead from multiple gunshot and stab wounds, Bush said.

Jones’ young son, Mason, had been shot in the head but was still alive. He remains in critical condition at UAB Hospital.

A short time later, the chief said, Anniston police spotted Haynes and a high-speed chase ensued. Oxford police Chief Bill Partridge said the pursuit traveled into Oxford on Highway 202.

The chase traveled along Interstate 20, then past Choccolocco Park, onto Highway 21 into Munford and then ended up on a county road just inside the Talladega city limits.

“The suspect ran off the road into a field and when the pursuit terminated, he shot himself,’' Partridge said.

Haynes was airlifted to UAB Hospital where he later died. Bush said a motive has not yet been determined. “Our prayers are with the family members of all involved,’' he said.

A GoFundMe has been launched to help the family with medical and burial expenses. Donations can be made here.

“One of our family members Katlynn Jones who was just 24 years young was involved in a tragic event and she sadly lost her life,’' the GoFundMe reads. “Her son Mason who was also involved is in the hospital and in critical condition and has been giving 3 days to live. Please pray for our family as we go through this hard time! Any amount would be greatly appreciated!”
