Both Perez-Angeles and Daza-Quiroz also were involved in the July 19, 2008 fatal shooting of Leslie Allen, according to records from the Alameda County District Attorney's Office. The Alameda District Attorney's office cleared both officers of criminal misconduct in the Jones and the Allen shootings.

In addition, records from the City of Mountain View reveal that while Perez-Angeles was in the US Marine Corps and living in Burlingame, he and two other men were arrested by police for assaulting a man outside a bar on March 3, 2000. Perez-Angeles was charged with battery causing serious bodily harm and pleaded no contest to an infraction in Santa Clara County court later that year.
