An armed man who barricaded himself inside an apartment in Lebanon committed suicide following a standoff with police, officials said.

The incident started at about 6:45 a.m. Saturday along the 900 block of Walnut Street, according to city police.

A 53-year-old man was holding a woman and his 23-year-old handicapped daughter captive in the home for more than three hours, police said.

The woman was eventually able to escape and called for help, police said.

"The police arrived and were advised that the male was in the apartment with his handicapped daughter. The male was armed with a handgun and refused to talk with police," according to a news release.

The Lebanon County Emergency Service Unit eventually entered the home, rescued the daughter, and removed her from the home, police said.

Police did not say what time the standoff ended.

"After the Team brought her out to a safe location the Team went back into the apartment. The (man) was found deceased in a rear bedroom with what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound," police said.

The identity of the man has not yet been released pending the notification of family members.
