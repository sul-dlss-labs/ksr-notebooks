Authorities are investigating a possible murder/suicide on I-20 near Heflin.

Two women are dead as a result of an apparent kidnapping followed by a murder/suicide on Interstate 20 near Heflin.

The two were found in a black 2000 Dodge Durango near the 208 mile marker. Sgt. Steve Jarrett with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said that after a brief stand-off with police, the driver shot the passenger, then herself.

Multiple media outlets are reporting that the victim has been identified as 49-year-old Sandra Barnett of Ellenwood, Ga., who was abducted Wednesday from her home. Barnett was reportedly kidnapped by her husband's mistress, according to Clayton County Police. The other woman's name has not been released.

Chief Deputy Brad Robinson of the Carroll County Sheriff's Office in Georgia said authorities began chasing the Durango after receiving a notification of the vehicle's description in connection with the abduction out of Clayton County.

"We were told the vehicle might be in the area as part of a possible kidnapping, with both the suspect and victim inside," Robinson said.

Deputies with Carroll County spotted the Durango exiting a service station off Interstate 20, attempted to stop the vehicle and began a chase onto the Interstate.

Alabama authorities got notification around 11:30 a.m. of the chase, Jarrett said. Upon entering Alabama, Carroll County deputies dropped back into a support position, until the chase stopped near Heflin.

"I don't think any shots were fired by any law enforcement," Robinson said.

The incident is under investigation by ALEA.
