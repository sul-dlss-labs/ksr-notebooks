ROANOKE -- Roanoke County's top prosecutor has concluded that three officers reacted properly when they fatally shot Micah Brentford Sword in a confrontation on U.S. 220 in February.

Yet questions remain unresolved as to why the 24-year-old Air Force veteran led law enforcement from Roanoke and Franklin counties on a late-night chase, and why he opened fire on the officers with an assault rifle.

"We still don't know what caused this," said Lt. Chuck Mason with the Roanoke County Police Department. "At this point I don't think we're ever going to know."

The shooting happened just after midnight Feb. 29, when a Roanoke County officer tried to stop a truck for speeding on Franklin Road. Sword, the driver, didn't stop, instead leading police on a pursuit south on U.S. 220.

As the chase neared the Franklin County line, a second county officer and two deputies with the Franklin County Sheriff's Office joined the pursuit.

Abruptly, Sword stopped the truck on the highway, stepped out and fired more than two dozen rounds at the officers from an assault rifle.

Roanoke County officers Shaun Chuyka and Spencer Lewis and Franklin County sheriff's Deputy Brian Garland returned fire. Sword died the next day from his wounds.

None of the officers was injured.

A police search of Sword's truck turned up other weapons.

Roanoke County Commonwealth's Attorney Randy Leach said this week that he spent five hours reviewing evidence provided by investigators from both counties, including statements from the officers and witnesses, photographs and video.

"The Police Department, along with assistance from Franklin County, did a very thorough investigation," Leach said. "There's no question in my mind that those officers were fired upon first, and then returned fire, and that was a justifiable situation."
