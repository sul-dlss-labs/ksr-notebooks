Corrections & Clarifications: A previous version of this story incorrectly misstated the charge against Shirley. He faces a charge of reckless homicide.

A man is facing preliminary charges of reckless homicide after police say he stole a car, fled from police and crashed into another vehicle, killing its driver Tuesday evening.

James Shirley, 28, was arrested shortly after the incident, which occurred on the southwest side of Indianapolis. Shirley is also facing preliminary charges of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle resulting in death, auto theft, possession of a controlled substance and possession of narcotics under five grams.

Edward Flynn, 66, was killed when Shirley's car struck his as Flynn waited at an intersection, police said.

Flynn, who went by the nickname Louie, had worked at IndyStar since 1971.

Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department were dispatched to the 5000 block of West Washington Street near the intersection of Lynhurst Drive at 5:45 p.m. on a report of a stolen vehicle.

Arriving officers found Shirley inside the stolen vehicle, and Shirley fled, according to a release from IMPD.

"The driver of the stolen vehicle struck the officer’s vehicle at least twice, then led them on a vehicle pursuit to the intersection of W. Morris Street and South Lynhurst Drive," police said.

That's where Shirley subsequently lost control of the vehicle and struck the car Flynn was driving.

Shirley was taken to the hospital in serious condition, according to police. Final charging decisions will be made by the Marion County Prosecutor’s Office.
