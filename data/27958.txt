The San Diego County District Attorney’s Office on Monday charged a sheriff’s deputy with second-degree murder in the killing of an unarmed man in May — a rare instance of criminal charges being brought against an officer for actions on the job.

The deputy, Aaron Russell, 23, is accused of shooting Nicholas Bils, 36, while Mr. Bils was running from officers after escaping from a California park ranger’s car on May 1.

Mr. Russell pleaded not guilty in a San Diego court on Tuesday and was released on bail. If convicted, he faces a minimum of 15 years in prison and up to a life sentence.

San Diego County’s district attorney, Summer Stephan, said in a statement on Monday that the office had reached a decision to press charges after conducting a thorough review of the facts in the case.
