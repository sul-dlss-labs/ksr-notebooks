Authorities on Wednesday identified the Anaheim police detective and the suspected car thief he shot and killed.

Rudy Delgado, a policeman for 18 years, shot 23-year-old Juan Alvarez Velasquez on Tuesday after, police spokesman Sgt. Rick Martinez said, Velasquez pulled out a handgun during a foot chase. Martinez said police had not determined whether Velasquez fired the gun.

Delgado had staked out a stolen 1998 Honda Civic parked on Moraga Street near Sequoia Avenue. Police on Tuesday said the car was a 2005 model. The car was reported stolen that morning, Martinez said.

Martinez said that when Velasquez, of Anaheim, got in the car and tried to drive away, he was blocked by a detective’s car. He ran, and was shot one block away, on Alamo Street.

Velasquez had outstanding warrants for a parole violation and suspected burglaries, Martinez said.

Anaheim police and the Orange County district attorney’s office are investigating the shooting.
