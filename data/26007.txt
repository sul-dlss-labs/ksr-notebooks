A man driving a stolen vehicle was killed in a rollover crash early Wednesday morning in Durham after leading Madison police on a car chase up Route 79.

The driver has not been identified, pending positive identification and notification of his family, state police said Wednesday.

Madison police had pursued the Mercedes Benz GL550 SUV, reported stolen by its owner on Island Avenue, but ended their chase shortly before the crash occurred at about 3:20 a.m. just across the town line into Durham, according to a state police report.

The Mercedes was traveling north on Route 79 when the driver apparently lost control, swerved across the road and rolled through the property in that area. State police have not said how fast the SUV was going.

The driver was ejected during the crash, police said. He was transported to Middlesex Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner will conduct an autopsy, police said.

More information about the theft and subsequent chase was not immediately available from Madison police on Wednesday night.
