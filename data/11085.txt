A Clovis man was killed in a motorcycle crash early Wednesday morning in Fresno after a pursuit by law enforcement, the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office said.

Just after midnight, a Fresno County Sheriff’s deputy activated his lights and siren in an attempt to make a traffic stop on a motorcycle rider at the intersection of Van Ness and Gettysburg avenues in Fresno.

The rider, identified as Robert Cooper, 46, refused to pull over, the Sheriff’s Office said. Instead, he sped away, reaching speeds of more than 90 mph.

After traveling five miles in five minutes, deputies canceled their pursuit, and the Fresno Police Department helicopter “Air 1” took over by following Cooper.

A short time later, Cooper crashed into a fence near McKinley and West avenues, the Sheriff’s Office said.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

No other information was immediately available.
