A grand jury has determined that there was no criminal conduct on the part of the Hall County sheriff's deputies who were present when a Wood River man shot himself.

The grand jury was convened on Wednesday, and its findings were among Hall County District Court paperwork Thursday morning.

The jury also ruled that no one else caused or contributed to the death of Shaun M. Moreland, 19, who died on Nov. 24 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

A grand jury must be called whenever someone dies in law enforcement custody or while being arrested. Local attorney Rachel Daugherty was the special prosecutor for the hearing.

Hall County Sheriff Jerry Watson said that after reviewing the deputies reports he knew there was little about their actions to question.

"It was bad enough to have this occur in a public setting but to then have the deputies run back through it" made Watson worry about "my guys," he said.

"They're weathering it well," he said.

The incident began with a disturbance call on Nov. 24. Deputy Donavon Fowler was in Wood River and responded to a home where Moreland was threatening a friend, Watson said.

Fowler waited outside the home for a backup deputy, Tanner Maly, to arrive from near Cairo, Watson said.

Just after Maly arrived, the two deputies got out of the patrol cars and were heading for the house when Moreland came out with a gun, Watson said.

The deputies took cover and drew their own weapons as Moreland walked toward them with the gun under his chin. He talked to the deputies prior to pulling the trigger, which occurred about two or three minutes after Maly arrived, Watson said.

Daugherty has also been named the special prosecutor for the Jan. 19 grand jury hearing regarding the death of Paul E. Smidt Jr.

Smidt, 40, took his own life with a chain saw on Dec. 22 during a standoff with local law enforcement agents who were attempted to serve a federal arrest warrant on him for being a felon in possession of a shotgun.
