Camarillo approached a woman at a gas station in the 4600 block of South Western Avenue and allegedly tried to take her minivan, police said. As she and her two sons struggled with Camarillo, the driver of a pickup truck came to help the family abd struck Camarillo in the abdomen and chest with a baseball bat. Camarillo then ran east on 47th Street. He approached a minivan and tried to pull the driver out of the vehicle, police said. Camarillo fell to the ground and was struck by the minivan.

An off-duty officer witnessed the incident and called 911. He tried to take down the minivan's plate number and then went to help Camarillo, police said.
