RALEIGH, N.C. â€” Raleigh police said the driver responsible for crashing into a home in the 800 block of E. Lenoir Street in the wee hours of Friday morning, killing a man inside, had refused to stop when an officer tried to pull him over.

Anthony Joseph Gaines, 42, died inside the residence when the suspect's vehicle collided with the house shortly after midnight, police said.

Police arrested Etgar Edva Bautista-Montoya, 19, at the scene and charged him with with driving while intoxicated and felony death by motor vehicle, police said. The suspect was initially booked on a $160,000 bond.

Two other minors were in the car with Bautista-Montoya; police said neither was seriously injured.

Police first tried to pull over Bautista-Montoya for speeding on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard near State Street, but he apparently refused to pull over.

Police said the officer backed off the traffic stop moments before Bautista-Montoya crashed into the home. No Raleigh officers were involved in the crash, police said. A police spokeswoman said the officer did not chase the suspect because of department rules that prohibit police pursuits.

"Violators who refuse to comply with a traffic stop for lesser offenses will not be pursued or followed regardless of speed," according to the policy provided Friday to WRAL News.

Two youngsters inside the home were taken for medical treatment to WakeMed, where they were treated and released for minor injuries, police said.

The home's owner told WRAL News Friday that Gaines had served in the U.S. Marines and had two children. The owner also said the victim had rented the home for a couple of years.
