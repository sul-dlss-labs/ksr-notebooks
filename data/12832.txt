COMPTON, Calif.

The deputy-involved shooting happened around 7:30 p.m. Thursday on East Palmer Street near North Bradfield Avenue.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department says two deputies from its Compton Station responded to calls of shots fired at the intersection of North Bradfield Avenue and San Luis Street. They spotted a black Pontiac speeding from the scene and followed it until they reached a dead end.

That's when deputies say the driver, Rashawn Brown of Compton, got out of the Pontiac, ran down a driveway and then pointed a handgun at them. Deputies say they feared for their lives and opened fire.

Brown was shot numerous times, according to authorities. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he later died. His age was not immediately known.

One deputy suffered a non-life threatening cut to his hand but was not struck by gunfire.

Authorities say the handgun carried by the suspect was recovered at the scene.
