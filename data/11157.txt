A vehicle being chased by deputies in connection with a home robbery on Tucson’s southwest side early Tuesday crashed into a building, killing two of four people inside, officials said.

The incident started about 2 a.m. when three women told deputies they were followed home and robbed by people who first approached them at Casino del Sol,

The women said they left the casino because the group’s contact made them uncomfortable. However, they realized they were being followed on their way to a home in the 3700 block of West Exton Lane, Deputy Dawn Barkman, a Pima County Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman said in a news release.

A man rolled underneath the closing garage door and pistol-whipped one of the women. The others followed him into the home and the group left with purses and other items, Barkman said.

Deputies spotted a white Jeep Cherokee matching the description given by the residents of the home near West Los Reales Road and South Cardinal Avenue.

The driver refused to stop, speeding off east on West Valencia Road, and at one point someone in the car threw a gun out the window, hitting a patrol car.

The car continued onto westbound Interstate 19 and the driver lost control on the Ajo Way exit, speeding over a median and smashing into an urgent care facility at the shopping center at the intersection, Barkman said.

Caron Ramell Rivers, 30, and Nina Roxanne Smith, 21, died in the crash.

Two other people in the vehicle were taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. Cory Rivers, 33, was arrested on suspicion of aggravated robbery, armed robbery, aggravated assault, kidnapping, first degree burglary and first degree murder.

Irma Coronado, 33, was not arrested, though Barkman noted additional charges could be pending.
