Cops have identified a brazen robber killed by an off-duty cop during a shootout in a Brooklyn auto shop, police said Sunday.

Kenneth Williams, 21, of Brownsville, and an accomplice announced a stickup Saturday inside Mel's Auto Specialist in East Flatbush and flashed a .45-caliber gun, police said.

Off-duty narcotics detective Ray Williams - a 17-year veteran who was in the shop getting his Lexus fixed - identified himself and drew his gun. He is not believed to be related to the robber.

Bullets began to fly and Kenneth Williams was shot in the neck, cops said. It's unclear who fired first, police said.

The second thug grabbed his buddy's gun, started shooting and fled in a white Chevy TrailBlazer, police said.
