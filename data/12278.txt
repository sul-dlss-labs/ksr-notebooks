An 18-year-old Walworth County Jail inmate was shot and killed Monday night by a deputy he attacked while trying to escape during medical treatment at a town of Geneva hospital, the Walworth County Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

Alfredo Emilio Villarreal, of Janesville, was shot by an unidentified deputy guarding him at the Aurora Lakeland Medical Center, W3985 County NN, in the town of Geneva just outside Elkhorn, the release states.

Villarreal had been taken to the hospital for tests and observation of a personal medical issue. He was in the Walworth County Jail on a probation and parole hold from the Department of Corrections.

The Sheriff's Office said that Villarreal attacked the deputy at about 6:45 p.m. Monday in an attempt to escape, punching and kicking the deputy several times in the face.

"The deputy called for assistance and multiple law enforcement agencies responded to the medical center," said Sheriff David Graves in the release.

The deputy deployed a Taser on Villarreal but it didn't stop him.

"He used a chair to try to break out a window in his room," Graves said. "When this attempt failed, the inmate attempted to strike the deputy over the head with the chair, with the deputy discharging their handgun, striking the inmate."

Despite lifesaving measures, Villarreal was declared dead at the scene, the Sheriff's Office said.

The investigation into the shooting is being handled by the Waukesha County Sheriff's Office at the request of the Walworth County Sheriff's Office and the Town of Geneva Police Department.
