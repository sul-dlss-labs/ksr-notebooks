A woman suspected of driving under the influence was shot and killed by police during a confrontation in Torrance Monday afternoon, officials said.

The driver’s behavior was first reported about 2:30 p.m. near the intersection of Arlington and Post avenues after Torrance police began getting multiple calls about a possible DUI and reckless motorist, Sgt. Paul Kranke said.

Officers then spotted the vehicle driving on the wrong side of the road and watched it almost hit several cars. The vehicle had already been damaged and the airbags were deployed, Kranke said.

Officers tried to stop the vehicle, a Ford Fusion, when the driver allegedly tried to run over officers. Cellphone video taken at the scene and posted on Twitter shows at least two officers firing their weapons at the car.

The Fusion then crashed into a patrol car and drove into a Chevron gas station — at the intersection of Cabrillo Avenue and Sepulveda Boulevard — before the video ends.

“At that point, when she drove at the officers, she put their lives in danger,” Kranke said. “Several of the officers were out of their vehicles and she drove directly at them at that point.”

One of the officers suffered moderate injuries during the incident.

The shooting occurred about a mile from the intersection where emergency callers first reported the dangerous driving.

The woman, described as being in her 30s, was taken to a hospital, where she was later pronounced dead, Kranke said. She has not been identified.

Police were asking motorists to avoid the intersection of Cabrillo Avenue and Sepulveda Boulevard during the investigation.

Aerial video from Sky5 showed the vehicle parked at the gas station with bullet holes all over and the driver’s window shattered.
