The parents of a Union County double homicide suspect fatally shot by Cherokee Sheriff’s Office deputies were killed by their own son.

That’s according to preliminary autopsy results released Friday by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Complete autopsy results are pending at the GBI’s Medical Examiner’s Office.

The GBI’s regional office in Cleveland around 5:45 p.m. Thursday received a call for assistance from Union County Sheriff Mack Mason after his deputies discovered the bodies of Charles Payne, age 59, and Louise Payne, age 67, at a home at 1098 Nottley Dam Road in Blairsville.

GBI authorities discovered the Payne’s 2005 Ford F-150 pick-up truck was missing from the home and they later determined by an investigation that the couple’s son, Anthony Payne, 34, was a suspect in the couple’s death.

Authorities received information that Payne may have been located at a residence 790 Swan Lake near Holly Springs, so the GBI notified the Cherokee Sheriff’s Office to be on the look out for Payne, who they classified as “armed and extremely dangerous.”

Cherokee deputies later located Payne and shot and killed the suspect in a confrontation early Friday morning.

Less than week after a Cherokee County Sheriff’s Office deputy shot a wanted Blairsville man, the GBI Medical Examiner has determined that the 34-year-old man died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound and not from the law enforcement officer’s bullet.

He died about 1:30 a.m. Friday after a standoff and gunfire with a Cherokee County sheriff’s deputy after refusing to drop his gun, deputies said.
