Phoenix police say a woman has died in an officer-involved shooting Wednesday evening.

The incident happened near 43rd Avenue and Union Hills Drive around 6:45 p.m. when officers were responding to a call of shots fired, hitting the caller's home.

Police started containing the suspect's home across the street and contacted family members who said the suspect, later identified as 44-year-old Alexis Stinson, had already fired shots inside the home.

Stinson reportedly ran out with a rifle, pointed the weapon at officers and fired shots which prompted three officers to return fire, hitting the woman.

Police say Stinson was pronounced dead at the hospital.

No officers or civilians were hurt during the incident.

The three officers involved were a 32-year-old man with nine years of service, a 34-year-old man with 11 years of service, and a 32-year-old man with 10 years of service.
