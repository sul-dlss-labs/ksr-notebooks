A Long Island father of two – who was drunk, agitated and pointing a loaded shotgun at cops – was shot and killed by the officers in self-defense, police said.

A Nassau County police spokesman, Detective Sgt. Kevin Smith, said Roy Wright, of 1701 Kirkwood Ave. in Merrick, was struck by four bullets fired by some of the six officers after he leveled a 12-gauge weapon at them in the parking lot of a Home Depot in Freeport early yesterday.

“He was in an agitated state and he was waving the shotgun around” at 1:40 a.m., said Smith.

Wright, a home inspector, at one point placed the weapon’s butt on the ground and his head over the barrel, as if he were about to shoot himself.

When he again leveled the gun at the officers, they fired, killing him, said Smith.
