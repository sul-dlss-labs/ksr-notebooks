A man was shot and killed by a police officer in Batesville after a nearly four-hour standoff on Monday, police said.

The Batesville Police Department responded to a disturbance at about 8 a.m. at a residence on Bridlewood Trace Road, according to an Indiana State Police release.

Police said officers were able to get a woman and three children out of the house after arriving.

A gunshot was fired toward an officer from inside the house, according to the release. The officer was standing outside a garage door in an attempt to make contact with the man inside when the shot was fired, police said.

Debris caused by the shot caused minor injuries to the officer, according to the release.

More shots were fired from inside the house at 11 a.m. after an Indiana State Police SWAT Team and hostage negotiation team had arrived, police said.

At about 11:30 a.m. a man came outside of the residence's garage with a handgun.

Officers fired, striking the man with at least one gunshot, according to the release.

Police officers provided immediate medical attention. Batesville EMS took the man to Margaret Mary Health in Batesville where the man died as the result of his injuries, police said.

The identity of the suspect and officers involved will come later, police said.

An autopsy and toxicology results are pending.

Detectives of the Indiana State Police-Versailles Post are leading the investigation.

Indiana State Police Sgt. Stephen Wheeles said several surrounding agencies responded to the residence Monday morning where the person had barricaded.

The names of the suspect and the officer involved in the shooting were not yet released.
