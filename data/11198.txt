A 48-year-old reckless driving suspect from Apple Valley died while being walked to a patrol car after leading California Highway Patrol officers on a car chase and foot pursuit this week in Victorville, say San Bernardino County coroner’s officials.

Joel Benge died at 4:03 p.m. Wednesday in Victor Valley Community Hospital an hour after the incident.

Benge was driving a Nissan Versa along the 14200 block of Amargosa Road in Victorville when an officer tried to stop him, coroner’s officials said in a written statement. The pursuit became a foot race into the desert near El Evado Road and Hopland Street before Benge was taken into custody.

“Officers were taking him back to the patrol units (when) he suddenly became unresponsive,” according to the statement. “An autopsy will be conducted to determine the cause of death.”

San Bernardino County sheriff’s homicide detectives are investigating the incident.
