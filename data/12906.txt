The Queens woman killed by her cop husband contacted a locksmith to have her front-door locks changed just hours before she was gunned down, sources said yesterday.

NYPD school-safety agent Lana Morris — whose husband, Sherlon Smikle, 33, shot her and then himself Wednesday evening — contacted Paragon Security and Locksmith in Queens the day she was killed, asking for two locks to be changed at her St. Albans home.

She already had a restraining order against Smikle, who handed her divorce papers in March, the sources said.

But she apparently wanted more protection — and reached out to the locksmith through Safe Horizon, an agency dedicated to helping victims of domestic abuse.

Hours after the call, Smikle chased his wife down the block and blasted her four times with a shotgun. He then went back in the house and killed himself.

Cops had been called to the house at least twice in the past month. In the most recent dispute, Smikle’s NYPD-issued gun was taken away and he was transferred from the 83rd Precinct to the Housing Bureau, the sources said.
