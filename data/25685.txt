A man was fatally shot by police after allegedly robbing a Family Dollar and firing a gunshot at an officer in DeKalb County on Tuesday night.

The incident happened at the store at 4787 Covington Highway, DeKalb County police Sgt. J.D. Spencer told AJC.com. Police Chief James Conroy told Channel 2 Action News a man, identified Wednesday by the GBI as 22-year-old Steven Louis Goins, robbed the store just before it closed at 10 p.m.

The man then allegedly ran away on Glenwood Road, where an officer tried to take him into custody, Channel 2 reported. Goins is accused of shooting at the officer and missing before the officer returned fire.

Goins was taken to a local hospital in critical condition, Spencer said. He later died.

“A gun and a bag of money were located in close proximity to Goins,” the GBI said.

The officer was not hurt.

The GBI was called to investigate the shooting, which is protocol in use-of-force cases.

This is the 17th time the agency has been asked to investigate an officer-involved shooting in 2019.

The shooting occurred not far from the scene of a deadly shooting inside another Family Dollar on Covington Highway.

A customer shot and killed a suspected armed robber, identified as 19-year-old Zaquan Charles, inside the store at 7042 Covington Highway on Jan. 29, police said.

The customer has not been identified. The case has been turned over to the DeKalb County District Attorney’s office, according to police.
