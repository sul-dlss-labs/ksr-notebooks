An investigation and district attorney review of a May 9 shooting found that Josephine County deputies used justifiable force when they killed a woman who threatened them with a gun during a confrontation outside a Grants Pass home.



Micki Rae Broeske was hit with six bullets from a .233-caliber rifle fired by Deputy John Holder and one beanbag round fired by Sgt. Ray Webb. She died at the scene.



"The evidence revealed that Micki Broeske was in a suicidal state and had sought out a confrontation with police," Josephine County District Attorney Stephen D. Campbell said in a news release today. "Her actions forced the police to employ deadly physical force against her."



Broeske had called the sheriff's office that morning and said she was holding her sister at gunpoint and planned to kill her. When deputies arrived, Broeske was outside her sister's house, Campbell said.



Broeske rapidly approached Webb and Holder and pointed a .22-caliber revolver at them after refusing repeated requests to surrender, the district attorney said.
