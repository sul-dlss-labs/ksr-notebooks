Earlier: A 56-year-old man died Tuesday morning in an apparent self-inflicted shooting during a traffic stop.

The incident happened after 9 a.m. in the 3400 block of 39th Place North of East Lake Boulevard. Authorities have not yet publicly identified the man.

According to Birmingham police, an East Precinct officer was attempting to conduct a traffic stop when the man pulled into his driveway. Before the officer could get out of the patrol car, said Sgt. Johnny Williams, the man pulled a gun and fatally shot himself. He was pronounced dead on the scene.

More than 50 family members gathered outside the police perimeter, questioning the circumstances of the shooting. Williams said the officers body camera captured the entire incident and shows the gunshot was self-inflicted.

Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates was also at the scene and said the investigation is ongoing. He said the no foul play is suspected and the death is not being investigated as a homicide.
