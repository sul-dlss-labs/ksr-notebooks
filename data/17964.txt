Disturbing new details were released Monday in a Katy shooting that left two young women and their mother dead.

A Fulshear police officer shot and killed 42-year-old Christy Sheets Friday after she shot her two daughters, 22-year-old Taylor and 17-year-old Madison.

It happened outside their home in the 6000 block of Remson Hollow Lane in the Katy area.

Detectives Monday said Christy Sheats called a family meeting Friday that also included her husband Jason, 45.

When they gathered in the living room, Christy pulled out a gun and shot Taylor and Madison. The girls and their father ran out the front door where Madison collapsed and died.

Taylor ran into the street and Christy Sheats followed, shooting Taylor again, according to detectives. A witness said she went back inside the home to reload the gun.

Jason Sheats ran to the end of the cul-de-sac.

When a FBCSO detective and Fulshear officer arrived, they saw Sheats shoot Taylor a third time.

Sheats ignored their orders do drop her gun so the officer fired one shot, killing her.

Taylor Sheats was airlifted to Memorial Hermann Hospital where she died.

Neighbors remain shocked.

"I just heard a quarrel, a domestic dispute," said Sabeeh Siddiqui, who heard and saw the end of the fight Friday afternoon. "I didn't want to get involved, but soon afterwards, I heard a gunshot, so I opened up the blinds, and I saw a police officer aiming his gun toward somebody and saying drop your weapon," Siddiqui said.

Investigators found the murder weapon was a five-shot, .38 caliber handgun.

Taylor graduated with honors from Lone Star College Cy-Fair in the spring of 2015.

Madison was going to be a senior at Seven Lakes High School.

Jason Sheats wasn't injured, but he had to be taken to the hospital because he was so broken up. Friday was his birthday.

"Dad really loved the daughters, kids were well mannered, very respectable as well," said Chapin Knickerson, a neighbor.

Christy Sheats' former employer says he was shocked by the news.

"It shook me to the core. It was shocking, truly shocking," said John Hollis, who employed Christy for several months last year at his tattoo removal business. "She had a charm about her; apparently that was something that if she wanted to turn it on, she could turn it on and if turned the other way, it turned the other way."

He says she worked as a receptionist, answering phone calls and booking appointments, not as a business manager as she posted on her LinkedIn page.

Hollis says he didn't notice any warning signs but he did say she was separated from her husband and kids at the time.

A family friend in Alabama did tell KHOU 11 that the Sheats were always having marital problems and that Jason was doing everything he could to fix their issues.

"I don't think anyone at any time, at any place can ever tell me anything that will make any sense of this awful, awful tragedy," Hollis said.

The Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office has responded to 14 calls for service at the residence since January of 2012. Three of those calls were for attempted suicide but investigators aren't saying who was involved.

"Due to legal constraints issued by the county attorney, the Fort Bend County Sheriff’s Office cannot describe the other calls for service, or release the 911 calls at this time," the sheriff's office said in a written statement.

Posts on Christy Sheats' Facebook page gave no indication of any family issues.

A gofundme.com account has been set up by friends of Jason Sheats to help with burial expenses.
