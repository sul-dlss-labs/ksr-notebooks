The case of a Lubbock man who died after he was tased by a Lubbock police officer will go before a grand jury next month. That Lubbock County Grand Jury will decide if charges should be filed in the death of Juan Nunez III.

Nunez died on Easter Sunday at his parents home in the 4400 block of Jarvis. Officer Matt Doherty was responding to a domestic disturbance when he tased Nunez four times. Nunez suffered a brain injury after he fell and hit his head. The Lubbock Medical Examiner said all of those factors played a role in his death.

His family has since filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the city and the maker of the taser.
