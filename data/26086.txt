PASADENA — A man armed with a rifle and gun and wearing a bullet-proof vest died in a confrontation with police in Pasadena, but it was unclear Saturday morning whether the suspect was killed by police gunfire or took his own life.

An autopsy was pending to determine whether Daniel Warren of Pasadena, 36, died from a self-inflicted wound or a round fired by a police officer, coroner’s Lt. David Smith said.

Officers responded to a call of a man with a gun in the 1500 block of Glen Avenue near Howard Street, just east of the Foothill (210) Freeway, at 6:30 p.m. Friday and spotted the suspect standing in the yard of a home, wearing “a ballistic bullet proof vest and holding a firearm,” according to Deputy Erin Liu of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which was assisting the Pasadena Police Department with the investigation.

The suspect yelled at officers, then pointed the weapon at them and an officer-involved shooting occurred, she said.

The suspect ran to the rear of the home, where officers found him lying unconscious with at least one gunshot wound. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Liu said.

A rifle with a large capacity drum style magazine and handgun were found near the suspect. Evidence at the scene indicated the suspect had fired at least one round.

No officers were injured.
