SEATTLE (AP) -- A homicide suspect killed by Seattle police over the weekend had previously served 18 years in prison for beating a teenage girl to death with a metal baseball bat.



Detectives shot Eric Blaine Evans, 46, in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood Sunday. They were able to track him there because he had been using credit cards that belonged to an 84-year-old worker at a storage facility who was stabbed to death a day earlier, police said.



Evans was convicted of murdering 17-year-old Teresa Marie Arbini in April 1988, The Seattle Times reported. Arbini was last seen getting into a taxi with him; he later dropped her body off in the detached garage of her house, and police found him sleeping on the sofa. Her purse and bloody clothes were found at the room he rented.



He served 18 years of his 27-year sentence before he was released. The Department of Corrections was compiling additional details about his time in custody, a spokeswoman said.



King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg, then a deputy prosecutor, handled the Arbini case. He said evidence showed Evans had tried to rape the girl. When Evans was sentenced, the corrections department was allowed to reduce a sentence by as much as one-third for good behavior, Satterberg said.



When he was sentenced for killing Arbini, Evans sobbed and told the judge he wanted to succeed in life and get an education in prison.



"I've shed more tears than her family," he said.



Authorities have not released the identity of the elderly man killed at A-1 Self Storage in the Interbay neighborhood.



Evans was shot after he attacked detectives who confronted him Sunday, Seattle police spokesman Mark Jamieson said.
