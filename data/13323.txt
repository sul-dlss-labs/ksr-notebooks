A serial bank robber has been sentenced to 20 years in prison in connection with a botched Ottawa County bank robbery that led to the death of a truck driver, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Tulsa.

Francis Harry Dishmon, 52, was also fined $9,076, records show. He was sentenced Thursday.

Dishmon was convicted in November of attempting to rob the IBC Bank in Miami, Oklahoma, but the federal jury failed to reach a verdict on the death of James Carl Wivell, 48, of Longmont, Colorado. The charge of killing a person while attempting to avoid apprehension was later dropped.

Wivell, a truck driver, was southbound on U.S. 69 north of Quapaw in August 2013 when he was killed when his rig overturned while he was trying to avoid hitting Dishmon’s wrecked car, which police had been chasing after the attempted bank robbery.

Dishmon had fled the bank without money after he was shown an empty cash drawer and the teller left her post to get money.

A gun was never displayed, police said at the time.

Dishmon led authorities on a high-speed chase through northern Ottawa County before he was apprehended in a wooded area near the crash site.

In 1995, he pleaded guilty to robbing and receiving stolen property from two Indianapolis banks and was sentenced to three years in prison. He was released in August 1998.

In 2000, Dishmon was convicted of robbing two Alabama banks and a Florida bank and was sentenced to eight years in prison. He was released in January 2013.

An Ottawa County District Court charge of second-degree murder in connection with the truck driver’s death was dismissed in November 2013 when federal charges were filed, court records show.
