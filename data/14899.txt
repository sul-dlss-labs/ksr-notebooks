BRISTOL, Va. (AP) - A special prosecutor says a fatal police shooting in Washington County was justified.

Assistant commonwealth’s attorney Gerald Gray investigated the July 8 shooting of 55-year-old Dennis Dean Morrell by Washington County sheriff’s deputies.

The Bristol Herald Courier (https://bit.ly/1xCQH6Q ) reports that Gray sent a letter Tuesday to a Washington County judge clearing the deputies of any wrongdoing. The letter says Gray found no criminal liability.

The deputies were responding to a report of an armed man barricaded inside a home.

An investigative report says Morrell was shot after he raised an automatic pistol in the direction of a deputy. The shooting followed attempts by police to communicate with Morrell.
