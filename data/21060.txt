On Nov. 16, Richard Darrel Bevins of Springfield Township died from injuries sustained in a two vehicle crash involving a patrol car operated by an Oakland County Sheriff Deputy.

Sergeant Mark Gardner of the Springfield Township substation said the crash occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m. on Andersonville Road just south of Farley Road.

Bevins, 28, was transported to Genesys Hospital where he was pronounced dead from unspecified injuries. He was not wearing a seat belt at the time of the accident, according to a release from Sheriff Michael Bouchardâ€™s office.

Deputy Dean Lambouris of the Springfield Township substation was transported to Pontiac Osteopathic hospital where he was treated for injuries and released the same day. The deputy was wearing his seat belt at the time and his air bags deployed.

The crash remains under investigation at this time and has yet to show if alcohol was a factor in the crash.
