Edwardsville: Police officer fired after suspected DUI

A police officer and member of the FBI drug task force was fired Monday following a weekend traffic accident that occurred when he was apparently driving while intoxicated, Edwardsville Police Chief John Ellison said.

He said that Sgt. Jim Marble was off-duty Friday night when his vehicle rear-ended a tractor-trailer that had stopped to make a turn on Kansas 32 just inside the Edwardsville city limits.

The truck driver was not injured. Marble was treated for minor injuries.

Ellison said Marble was driving a vehicle issued through the FBI drug task force.

Ellison said he did not know whether Marble was cited.

Branson, Mo.: Concrete failure may have caused collapse



Concrete failure was suspected in the collapse of a 25-foot section of walkway at Silver Dollar City theme park that injured 21 people.

Structural engineers were trying to determine Tuesday whether a slight dip in the center of the walkway may have resulted in the collapse.

The accident happened Monday afternoon as about 50 people waited on the 40-foot walkway to ride the Lost River of the Ozarks. The walkway was suspended about 2 1/2 feet above the ride’s waterway.
