A southeastern Minnesota police officer was cleared of wrongdoing on Jan. 31 when he shot and killed a man who had shot his estranged wife moments earlier, authorities said Friday.

Zumbrota officer Rob Jarrett killed Thomas Robinson, 37, who had shot and wounded Rebecca Robinson, 28, in the driveway of their home. Jarrett had accompanied Rebecca Robinson to the house so she could move some of her belongings.

Thomas Robinson was pronounced dead at the scene. Rebecca Robinson suffered gunshot wounds to the chest and abdomen but is expected to make a full physical recovery, authorities said. None of her wounds came from Jarrett's .40-caliber weapon, authorities said.

Rice County Attorney G. Paul Beaumaster investigated the shooting to avoid a conflict of interest in Goodhue County.

"The facts as presented to me show Officer Robert Jarrett acted appropriately and responded as he should have when confronted with an individual who was himself using deadly force against another," Beaumaster said in a letter to Goodhue County Attorney Stephen Betcher.

"Any charges stemming from this incident would have been against the decedent, Thomas W. Robinson," the letter said. "Since Mr. Robinson is deceased, no charging is warranted in this matter."
