A Rosemont man who was fatally shot by police when he pointed a gun at them during a robbery attempt in Des Plaines committed "suicide by cop," police said Friday.

Paul Rapacz, 37, of the 6200 block of Hawthorne Street was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, officials said. He died of a bullet wound to the chest, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

"We have reason to believe that he was committing `suicide by cop,'" said Rosemont Lt. Kieran Mackey.

The shooting is under investigation. The officers who fired the shots will be placed on desk duty until the inquiry is complete.

Rapacz entered O'Hare Liquors, 2687 S. Mannheim Rd., about 7:30 p.m., pointed a handgun at a clerk and stole $10 and a six-pack of beer, said Des Plaines Deputy Police Chief Jim Prandini. A half-hour later, shortly after the clerk had called his boss to report the robbery, Rapacz returned and stole liquor and cash, Prandini said.

A friend of the clerk's who was at the store flagged down Rosemont police officers directing concert traffic at Allstate Arena across the street, Prandini said. The clerk fled, leaving Rapacz alone inside, Prandini said.

Officers surrounded the store and closed off Mannheim between Lunt and Morse Avenues. When Rapacz left the store, police repeatedly ordered him to drop his gun, Mackey said. Rapacz pointed the weapon at police, and two officers shot and killed Rapacz, he said.

Rapacz's criminal history dates to 1985 and includes assault, battery and weapons offenses, Mackey said.
