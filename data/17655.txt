Robert Mark Diaz, a 28-year-old Latino, died Friday, May 13, after he was shot by a Los Angeles Police officer in the 3400 block of Lee Street in Boyle Heights, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 8:25 p.m., gang officers from LAPD’s Hollenbeck Division were near East 7th and South Lorena streets when they saw a man standing with a group of other males, according to a news release from the department. As officers approached, the man began running away, LAPD Sgt. Frank Preciado said.

After a short chase, officers caught up with the man, who then pulled out a handgun and fired six rounds, striking an officer in the right arm.

The other officer fired at the man, who later was identified as Diaz, striking him. Diaz was pronounced dead at the scene. The officers both were taken to a hospital, where they were treated for their injuries and released.

Both officers were wearing body cameras. Police Chief Charlie Beck went to the shooting scene shortly before midnight, telling reporters he had visited with the wounded officer, who the chief said was a "very tough young man."

The officer's wife and baby daughter were with him at the hospital, Beck said.

"I worry about this every night," the chief said. "We’re very, very, very lucky that we didn't lose a Los Angeles police officer."

Investigators recovered the handgun in Diaz’s possession, according to a news release.

Police said that Diaz was a gang member with a lengthy criminal record.
