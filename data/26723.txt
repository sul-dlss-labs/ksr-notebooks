Updated 3 p.m. Thursday with information about the death of the suspect

DENVER â€“ A man who was shot by police in Denver's Highland neighborhood on Aug. 31 after he allegedly fired a revolver at an officer just feet away from him died this week at a hospital, officials said.

The officer wasn't injured, and police shot the man, Juan Carlos Macias, 37, who died Tuesday at Denver Health Medical Center, according to the Denver medical examiner.

The shooting happened about 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 31 near 15th and Central streets, near a foot bridge between downtown and the Highland neighborhood.

Lt. Matt Clark said police received two reports shortly after 10 p.m. from separate women about a man following and harassing them in the Highland area. One woman said the man fired a gun into the air.

Officers searched the area and found Macias in the 1500 block of Central. They talked with Macias for about a minute, and he was cooperative. When the officers began a warrant check on the Macias, he pulled a revolver from his waistband and fired at least one round at an officer who was "within a few feet," Clark said.

"We're extremely fortunate that officer was not injured or killed," Clark said.

The officer took cover behind nearby vehicles, and another officer fired multiple shots at Macias, striking him.

The officer who shot Macias has been placed on administrative duty as the investigation continued.
