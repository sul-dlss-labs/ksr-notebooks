An officer shot and killed a man who fatally stabbed a woman Friday morning in Fairfield, Police Chief Stephen Maynard said. On Saturday, the Butler County Coroner identified the two killed as Michelle R. Henry, 37, and Logan A. Williamson, 37. The incident happened around 6 a.m. at the Rolling Meadows condominium complex in the 1500 block of Gelhot Drive on Friday.Dispatchers received a call from a woman who claimed she needed help. In the 911 call, she can be heard yelling for help more than a dozen times.Dispatcher relayed what they heard to officers, who were sent to the scene."It sounds like a lot of movement and there's talking in the distance, background. In the beginning of the call, it sounded like someone dialed 911 and then someone came and grabbed the phone and screamed, 'Mom' and screamed, 'Help,' over and over again," a dispatcher said.The first officer at the scene told dispatchers that he heard the cry for help."I've got someone screaming inside. We gotta get the ram to get the door open," the officer said. "There's a lot of movement upstairs. I hear crashing and stuff."Officers forced their way in and found Williamson stabbing Henry in an upstairs bathroom, Maynard said."Officer Bryan Carnes, who was the first officer to make it to the bathroom, fired several rounds from his pistol, striking the male and stopping the immediate threat," Maynard said.Williamson was pronounced dead at the scene.Henry was transported to the hospital, where she was later pronounced dead.According to Fairfield police, Carnes, a three-year veteran of the Fairfield Police Department, and his supervisor, Sgt. Aaron Meyer, were placed on administrative leave. That's standard procedure when an incident such as this occurs. Meyer was at the scene at the time of the shooting.In a recent evaluation, Carnes was said to be "an asset to this department." It was also noted in his evaluation that his "knowledge of his job is above average for an officer of his experience."The investigation has been handed over to the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation.
