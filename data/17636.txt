ST. MARTIN, Miss. â€” Authorities in Mississippi say one person is dead following an officer involved shooting.

Jackson County Sheriff Mike Ezell said the shooting occurred early Monday morning at the Ramada Inn on Interstate 10 in St. Martin.

Ezell said in a release that deputies responded at the request of the clerk on duty to investigate possible drug activity in one of the rooms. When the deputies made contact with the suspect, he became "aggressively combative" toward the officer, the release said.

Another deputy arrived to assist in subduing the suspect, and the fight escalated until one of the deputies shot the suspect, who died at the scene.

Warren Strain, spokesman for the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation, tells The Associated Press by email, the sheriff requested that the MBI handle the investigation.

Strain said state crime scene technicians are on the scene collecting evidence.

The names of the deputies and the victim are not being released at this time. Both deputies are on administrative leave until further notice.

Strain said the body will be sent to the State Medical Examiner's Office for autopsy.
