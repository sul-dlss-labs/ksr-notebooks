Kevin Wooten, a 23-year-old black man, was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police officer Saturday, Dec. 25, in the 9900 block of Grape Street in Watts, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

LAPD officers were called to the Jordan Downs Housing Projects just before 4 a.m. after a report of an assault with a rifle. The officers were near an open field behind the housing area when they saw an occupied SUV adjacent to the field, police said.

While dealing with the people in that vehicle, they saw Wooten riding toward them on a bicycle. He was holding a rifle and ignored their commands, prompting them to shoot, police said.

Wooten was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead. According to coroner's records, he died from several gunshot wounds.

Police say an assault rifle was recovered at the scene. An investigation into the shooting has been launched, as is typical with officer-involved shootings.
