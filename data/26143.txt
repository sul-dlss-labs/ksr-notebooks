Fort Worth police said an armed man who barricaded himself in a home Saturday night pointed what turned out to be a flashlight at officers moments before he was fatally shot.

Officers responded about 6:40 p.m. to a domestic disturbance call in the 5700 block of Sixth Avenue. Cody Wayne Seals, 38, chambered a round and pointed a long rifle at responding officers, then shut himself inside a home, police said.

As officers tried to communicate with Seals, he came out the front door and took a "shooting stance with both arms out in front of him ... consistent with a weapon-mounted lighting system," police said in a written statement.

A SWAT team member fatally shot Seals after he pointed the object at an officer, police said.

Officials initially had said Seals "presented a threat to SWAT officers" but did not describe the threat. Police said Monday that the object he'd been holding was a flashlight.

The case will be sent to the Tarrant County district attorney's office for review after the criminal investigation is finished, police said.

The SWAT officer, a 10-year veteran with the department whose name has not been released, has been placed on administrative leave, routine in shootings involving police.
