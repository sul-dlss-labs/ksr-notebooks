A man is dead after an officer-involved shooting Thursday afternoon in rural Finney County.

The City of Garden City says the man who died from his injuries in the shooting is a 29-year-old from Garden City. He was identified as a suspect wanted by the Garden City Police Department for disorderly conduct and criminal damage to property in connection with an early Thursday-morning incident, police say.

Police have not identified the man.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation says "preliminary information indicates that deputies from the Finney County Sheriff's Office received a call from a citizen just before 11:30 a.m., reporting a male subject who was behaving erratically, and whose vehicle had become stuck on an unmaintained road approximately 15 miles southwest of Garden City."

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation says, according to preliminary information, a Finney County Sheriff's deputy arrived in the area a little before noon and found the man, holding a knife to his own throat. Soon police say he retreated to his vehicle and locked the doors.

A second deputy and a Garden City police officer arrived on the scene and attempts were made to talk to the man, the KBI says. The attempts to talk to him continued until the man emerged from his vehicle and charged toward the officers, the KBI says.

"At that time, two law enforcement officers, one from each agency, fired at the subject, fatally injuring him," the KBI says.

The KBI says the 29-year-old man died at the scene. No officers were injured.

Garden City says "the KBI is conducting an independent investigation of the situation."

The city says the Garden City Police Department and Finney County Sheriff's Office are also each conducting internal investigations.
