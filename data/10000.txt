A fugitive facing charges that could have sent him to prison for 25 years led the police on a six-mile chase through the Bronx early Saturday, battering vehicles in his way, but was cornered in a traffic jam and killed in a hail of 19 police bullets when, the authorities said, he tried to run over several officers.

The suspect, Orlando Santos, 28, described as a career criminal wanted on assault and drug charges, was slain in a faceoff just after midnight on the elevated Major Deegan Expressway near Alexander Avenue in a tangle of cars and trucks that blocked his escape. He had no weapon other than his car, the police said.

An uninjured passenger in the slain man’s car was taken into custody for questioning. A pregnant woman shaken up in one of a series of collisions in the weaving, high-speed chase was taken to Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center for observation. No one else was hurt, but at least eight vehicles, including a half-dozen SUV’s, a taxicab and a city sanitation truck, were struck during the rampage by the fleeing suspect.

Witnesses and investigators told of a wild chase through the back streets and major highways of the Bronx, of successive crashes as the suspect’s dark 1998 Ford Expedition slammed into vehicles in his path, and of chaotic scenes of flashing lights and wailing sirens as the pursuit ended with the suspect’s car boxed in at a construction zone where several traffic lanes were narrowed.
