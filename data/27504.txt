An officer with the Sapulpa Police Department is on leave after shooting an allegedly suicidal man who had come to a cemetery armed with a knife.

Sapulpa Police Capt. Glenn Coffey said officers responded shortly after 11 a.m. when an office worker at the Green Hill Funeral Home off Teel Road called to report a man with a knife who was threatening to harm himself.

The responding officer tried to talk to the man, later identified as 38-year-old Michael Collins, after he walked to nearby South Heights Cemetery. When he came at the officer with the knife, the officer fired, striking Collins once in the chest. Collins was responsive and speaking with medics at the scene, Coffey said, but died later in a hospital.

The officer will be placed on paid administrative leave while the OSBI investigates the shooting.

According to the Sapulpa Police Department, officers are outfitted with body cameras, but the equipment was broken on the officer who fired the shots. Upon completion of the investigation, a report will be submitted to the District Attorneyâ€™s Office to determine whether the shooting was justified.
