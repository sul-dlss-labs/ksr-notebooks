CHESTERFIELD â€” State police said a woman fleeing from a domestic incident in Henrico County shot herself to death when authorities tried to stop her car Monday morning on Interstate 95 near the Woods Edge Road exit.

The incident happened on the southbound side of I-95 and backed up traffic for more than a mile, according to he Virginia Department of Transportation.

Media reports from Richmond said the driver was reportedly involved in a domestic dispute with another woman at an apartment complex in Henrico earlier in the day. State police said they picked up the pursuit on I-95 near Arthur Ashe Boulevard.

After about 20 miles, state police used a tire-deflation device in an effort to slow the vehicle down. After the car hit the device, state police said the driver shot herself and wrecked the car.

She was the only person in the vehicle, state police said.
