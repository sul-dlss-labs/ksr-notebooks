Lake Como, Pa. - A man killed by Pennsylvania State Police following a 15-hour stand-off yesterday had pointed a long gun out a window, prompting troopers to shoot him, officials say.

The stand-off began shortly after 12:30 a.m., after a woman went to the home of John Chicosky, 36, on Route 247 in Lake Como, Pa. Lake Como is in Wayne County, about 14 miles from Hankins in Sullivan County. Police say the woman told them Chicosky had poured gasoline on his father after an argument. She was able to leave and call 911.

When troopers arrived, they began negotiating with Chicosky for his fatherâ€™s release. After 10 hours, Chicosky let the man go.

At 4:32 p.m. yesterday, police say, Chicosky appeared in an upstairs window, leveling a long gun at police.

Because of that, one trooper fired a single shot, killing Chicosky.

The investigation is continuing.
