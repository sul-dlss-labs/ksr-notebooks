PHOENIX – Police officers in Mesa shot a suspect early Monday after they responded to a call about a domestic argument that they said turned into a hostage situation.

The department said in a tweet that officers had gone to a home near Broadway and Gilbert roads around 3 a.m.

Detective Nik Rasheta said in an email that authorities were responding to a report of a family having a fight. A woman had called them to say her brother was going to shoot their father.

A few minutes after units arrived, a younger brother came out of the house. Police then talked with the suspect on the phone, who refused to put down the gun or leave the house.

Eventually, the father was able to leave and told police his son was loading a shotgun.

Around 3:40 a.m. the suspect was spotted at a window with the shotgun. Officers fired.

The suspect was taken to a hospital in critical condition; no officers were injured.

Broadway was shut down from Lindsay to Gilbert roads for the investigation.
