Montgomery County police have identified a man fatally shot by police officers at a restaurant and the two officers involved in the shooting.

Authorities identified the man as 63-year-old Fritz Otto Naecker, and the officers as Sgt. James Rudnick, a 17-year veteran, and Officer Matthew Wiedner, who has been with the department since 2007.

About 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, officers went to Sandy Spring Urban Bar-B-Que, 805 Olney-Sandy Spring Road, in response to a call about a man with a gun. When they arrived, officers saw Naecker in the restaurant's outdoor dining area armed with a firearm, Montgomery County police said.

Officers tried to communicate with Naecker and gave him verbal commands, but he refused to comply, police said. Rudnick and Wiedner discharged their service weapons, and Naecker was taken to a hospital, where he died as a result of his injuries.

Rudnick and Wiedner were placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure. The shooting's circumstances, including the number of shots fired, are under investigation.
