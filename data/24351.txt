A suspect who was shot after firing at deputies during a welfare check in Centennial on Saturday morning has died.

According to Julie Brooks with the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office, a woman called the agency saying she could not get in touch with a couple after what was believed to be a domestic disturbance.

When deputies arrived to the house on South Olive Street and East Caley Avenue around 10:30 a.m., Brooks says someone took off in a vehicle.

That person then fired at deputies from the vehicle using a handgun. Deputies returned fire, Brooks said, and struck the suspect. That suspect was taken to an area hospital, where he died.

No deputies or bystanders were injured.

Brooks said deputies have contacted the other person in the couple that was involved in the original welfare check.

According to a release, there is no information available regarding the number of shots fired by the suspect or the deputies. The Sheriff's Office is not releasing the names of the deputies involved or the suspect, but they say all four deputies have been with the agency for more than 10 years. Two of them have been there for more than 20 years.
