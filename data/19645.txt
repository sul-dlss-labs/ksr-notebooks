HERALD-LEADER STAFF REPORT



Two Kentucky State police officers are on administrative leave today, after they shot and killed a Spencer County man Sunday morning.



Kentucky State Police Capt. Tom Porter, Sgt. Lafe Owens and Taylorsville police officer Gordon Miles shot William J. Eldridge Jr. at 6:15 a.m., after he pointed a weapon at them during a three-hour confrontation, Kentucky State Police said.



Porter and Owens were placed on administrative duty, pending an investigation into the incident. The Taylorsville sheriff's office has not said whether Miles will be placed on administrative leave.



The Spencer County sheriff's office was called to 269 McClain Heights Lane, eight miles east of Taylorsville, about 3 a.m. for a domestic violence disorder. As they were nearing the residence, they met Eldridge, 42, who was driving a vehicle. He crashed into two sheriff's cruisers, causing significant damage to both vehicles. Eldridge, who was armed with at least two firearms, then ran into his residence, state police said.



About 3:50 a.m., state police arrived at the residence. After confirming that no one was in the house other than Eldridge, troopers tried to talk to him. More than an hour and a half later, Eldridge left the house, got into a vehicle and tried to escape, police said.



Troopers flattened his vehicle's tires, but Eldridge refused to stop and pointed a gun at the officers, police said.



Porter, Owens and Miles shot at Eldridge, police said.



Eldridge was pronounced dead at the scene about 6:15 a.m. by Spencer County Coroner Roger Thurman.



None of the officers was seriously injured during the stand-off. An autopsy for Eldridge is scheduled for today.
