MAYFIELD, OH â€” Two people were hurt and one was killed after a police pursuit ended in a car crash Saturday evening, according to several sources. As cleveland.com reports, one of the victims was a Willoughby Hills Police officer who responded to the crash.

According to that report, the incident started around 10 p.m. Sunday, when the officer saw a silver Chevy Corvette speeding almost 120 miles an hour down I-90. When the officer tried to pull the speeding car over, it took off heading onto Interstate 271. Shortly after, the Corvette lost control as it tried to leave the interstate in Highland Heights and slammed into a signal control box.

When the officer caught up to the crashed Corvette, he found the vehicle engulfed in flames according to Fox 8. The officer then stopped and pulled a burning passenger from the crashed car, suffering burns to his hands in the process. The passenger was taken to the hospital but died shortly afterwards. He has only been identified as a 59-year-old man from Cleveland.
