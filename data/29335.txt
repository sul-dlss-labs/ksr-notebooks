An autopsy is scheduled Sunday for Simmons, of the 600 block of North Avers Avenue.

Chicago police officers, who fired at least three times at the assailant who shot Simmons apparently did not hit the attacker, who was still at large.

The details, released by officials on the scene, were at least the third version of what happened about 11:45 a.m. Friday in the 1500 block of North Laramie Avenue.

Initially, a department spokesman said police returned fire after being shot at, then said officers had only witnessed someone getting shot and did not fire their guns.

Chief of Patrol Brian McDermott told reporters that community safety team officers saw a gunman fire several rounds at a southbound car, striking Simmons, who was driving. The car crashed at LeMoyne Street and Laramie.

The officers identified themselves and one of them fired three rounds at the gunman.

“In the defense of the life of the victim, one of the officers involved discharged his weapon,” McDermott said.

The gunman fled west on LeMoyne and police do not believe he was hit by the officer’s fire.

Simmons, who suffered several wounds to the head was initially taken to Stroger Hospital in critical condition.
