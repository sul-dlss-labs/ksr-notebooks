Police say they tried to stop a car shortly after 1 a.m. The driver fled the scene and reportedly ran a red light at 47th and King Drive striking a second car.

The crash killed Bianca White. Her family says she was on her way to visit her boyfriend.

"I'm hurting right now. I lost somebody so close to me and I never lost someone that close to me. And I'm only 23 years old," said Jasmine White, sister.

White's family says she was studying criminal justice at ITT and wanted to be a judge.

No charges have been filed in this case.
