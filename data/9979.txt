CENTREVILLE â€¢ A police officer shot and killed a man Sunday who was driving a car that had been stolen earlier from an elderly woman who also had been shot to death.

Police gave this account:

Shortly after 1 p.m., Centreville police got a tip and found the body of Gladys M. Cockrell, 88, of Centreville, who had been fatally shot near an open field in the 500 block of 42nd street. Police called the Major Case Squad to help in the investigation.

About an hour later, a police officer assigned to the Major Case Squad spotted Cockrell's car in the area and approached it. The driver sped away, and the officer gave chase. The driver of the stolen car shot at the officer near a service station across the street from the Centreville Police Department on Bond Avenue.

The officer returned fire, killing the driver, who was later identified as Cortez Hamm, 20, of East St. Louis.

The officer, who was not identified, was suspended with pay pending results of an investigation by Illinois State Police. The Major Case Squad continued to investigate Cockrell's killing.

Detective Scott Workman of Greenville police, deputy commander of the Major Case Squad, declined to comment on a possible motive for Cockrell's killing. He said her purse was found in her car after Hamm was killed.

Workman said authorities were investigating whether other people were involved in the shooting of Cockrell and the taking her car.
