GREENWOOD, Ind. -- Greenwood police shot and killed a man armed with a knife Saturday morning.

A spokesperson for the Greenwood Police Department said police were called to a house on the 800 block of Heatherwood Drive around 10:30 a.m.

A woman had called police, saying her boyfriend had stabbed her.

When the officer arrived, they found a man and a woman in a garage with the door open. The man had the woman at knifepoint, police say.

The man wasn't complying to police commands, and the officer was afraid he would take the woman's life, so he shot the man, killing him, according to the spokesperson.

The woman is stable at Eskenazi Health with stab wounds.

The officer will be placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. He is a decorated veteran of the force with over 20 years of service.
