A man suspected of stabbing a woman to death and critically injuring another man was shot and killed Monday by a Whittier Police Department officer after charging the officer while armed with a knife, authorities said.

Police received a 911 call about 5:50 p.m. during which they heard screaming in the background and believed there was a crash at the intersection of Telegraph Road and Norwalk Boulevard, according to Deputy Tracy Koerner of the Los Angeles County Sheriffâ€™s Department, which is assisting the Whittier Police Department with the investigation.

The first officer to arrive at the scene encountered the armed man, who charged the officer, prompting the shooting, Koerner said.

A preliminary investigation determined a man and woman were in a vehicle with the suspect and both had been stabbed by the suspect and taken to a hospital, where the woman was pronounced dead and the man was in critical condition. The suspect was also taken to a hospital where he died, Koerner said.

The names of the suspect and victims were not immediately disclosed.

The Whittier Police Department provides services to Santa Fe Springs under contract.
