Choung Van Nguyen

Berkeley city police identified the man whom officers shot and killed on Monday night as Choung Van Nguyen, 25. Police do not know where he was living right before his death.

Nguyen was shot around 10:45 p.m. Monday after he had been involved in a hit-and-run car accident in Albany. Police there chased his Honda Accord into Berkeley, where Nguyen abandoned his car on San Pablo Avenue and ran a few blocks to 8th and and Camelia.

When Nguyen was confronted by three Berkeley police officers he pulled out a semiautomatic pistol and fired at them, according to Sgt. Mary Kusmiss, the Berkeley police department spokeswoman. The three officers returned fire, killing Nguyen.

The officers were placed on paid administrative leave pending internal police investigations and a review by the Alameda County District Attorneyâ€™s office.

The San Francisco Chronicle identified the police officers as Sgt. Spencer Fomby and Officers Jim Marangoni and Thomas Syto.
