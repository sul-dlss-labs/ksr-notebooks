The Sheriff’s Department has released more information about the fatal stabbing and deputy-involved shooting in Joshua Tree Sunday. Deputies were called to the Valero gas station at the corner of Highway 62 and park Boulevard in Joshua Tree just after 1 p.m. for a report that two people had been stabbed. One victim, Shane Castro, 24, of Twentynine Palms, was driven to Hi-Desert Medical Center by a private party, where he later died of his injuries. The second victim, Anthony Frugoli, 26, received a non-life-threatening stab wound and was taken to a local hospital. The suspect, identified as David Urrea, 50, of Joshua Tree, had fled before deputies arrived, but deputies reviewed surveillance video and were able to get a description of him, his vehicle, and license plate number. Urrea was a registered sex offender, and had recently registered his address as a campsite in Joshua Tree near Broadway and Copper Mountain. A Sheriff’s helicopter, 40King 3, and deputies began to search the area. Urrea’s vehicle was found by the crew of 40 King 3, along with a woman. Deputies arrived and located Urrea; Urrea threatened a deputy and a deputy-involved shooting occurred. Urea was killed at the scene; the woman with him was not injured. Two teams of investigators from the Specialized Investigations Division – Homicide Detail responded to the locations and are conducting the investigations.

A GoFundMe account has been set up.
