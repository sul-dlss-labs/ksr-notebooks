UPDATED 8:52 P.M.

Two people were killed early today when a car traveling north on Interstate 77 in Bath Township crossed over the median strip into the southbound lanes, struck a pedestrian and crashed. The State Highway Patrol is still investigating. Check out WOIO Channel 19's report.



Lt. Joel Smith with the State Highway Patrol said that two boys, Kelvin Pantojas, 16, and Juan L. Hernandez, 18, both from Cleveland, went to the Tinseltown movie theater in Jackson Township in Stark County and stole a car from the theater lot. They were driving northbound on I-77 shortly after midnight, when a Fairlawn police officer who did not know about the theft saw the car and ran the license plate. The officer pursued the vehicle and signaled it to stop, but the 16-year-old driver speeded off, Smith said. The officer did not pursue per city policy.



Pantojas, the driver, went about eight miles still at a very high speed and struck and killed 74-year-old Calvin A. McMahan from Austintown, who was crossing I-77 on foot. The patrol officer said the man was familiar to troopers, and had been seen in the area in the past.



About 12:45 a.m., Pantojas lost control of the car after striking McMahan, crossed the southbound lanes and went into a wooded area after crashing into the light pole. Pantojas was killed in the crash and was not carrying identification. Hernandez was taken to Akron City Hospital with injuries.
