COCONUT CREEK, Fla. – Three Coconut Creek officers injured in a fatal police-involved shooting Monday night have been released from the hospital, the agency said Tuesday morning. A K9 is still being treated at an animal hospital but is expected to survive.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the incident that happened in a business complex on the 4400 block of Hillsboro Boulevard at approximately 8:24 p.m.

Authorities say a Florida woman was killed when two police officers opened fire after stopping a vehicle that had been stolen.

According to police, 36-year-old Brittni Muldrew was behind the wheel of a white Mercedes that officers confirmed had just been reported stolen.

When additional officers arrived to assist, police said Muldrew reversed the car in the direction of the officers, and two of them fired their weapons.

The Coconut Creek Police Department said in a news release the two officers have been placed on administrative leave during the FDLE investigation, as is standard procedure.

Authorities did not identify the officers.

A man in the passenger seat of the car, identified as 49-year-old Levon Lopez, was taken into custody. He’s facing charges of murder while engaged in a felony offense and grand theft auto.

Police said Lopez was not injured.

“I live on the next street over and at about 8:30 I heard a bunch of shots,” a witness said. “My wife said those are fire crackers, and I [said], ‘No, those are gunshots.’”
