Two officers shot and killed a man late Sunday night while responding to an assault in the Okolona neighborhood.

Around 9 p.m. Louisville Metro Police responded to the call of an assault in progress and shots fired in the 3200 block of Fern Valley Road, at the Industrial Park building, Police Chief Steve Conrad said.

As officers investigated the building, roughly an hour later, two officers made contact with an armed suspect when the shootout occurred.

“While officers were on scene, a man came out of that business armed with a handgun,” Conrad said. “Officers ordered the man to drop the weapon. He did not do so, and the officers fired their weapons to protect themselves.”

The suspect was transported to the University of Louisville hospital where he was later pronounced dead, Conrad said.

No officers were shot, but one was exposed to “bodily fluids” Conrad said, and is being treated at the hospital.

The two officers from the 7th Division have been placed on administrative leave while LMPD continues their investigation.

A press conference where the officer’s body camera footage will be examined is scheduled for Monday evening.
