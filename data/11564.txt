A Modesto man who was shot by police under unusual circumstances earlier this month has died, officers said Friday.A news release was issued to further detail the events of July 12.Police had suspected David Mendez, 68, of a felony sex crime.Specifics were withheld by officers to protect the victims, but detectives confirmed Mendez was sought by a Special Victims Unit, according to a news release from the Modesto Police Department.In an interview with Detective Steve Anderson, Mendez admitted his involvement in the crime, police said. The Modesto man was aware of the investigation and his pending arrest, according to the release.About 2:30 p.m. July 12, a detective and an officer went to Mendez' home the 1200 block of Muirswood Way to make an arrest.Mendez was home alone. He opened the front door and spoke with officers from the entryway.Mendez told officials he had a written confession prepared, and walked to a nearby desk in the front living room area, police said.The 68-year-old opened a desk drawer and pulled out a large aquatic knife, which was about 12 inches long.He started stabbing himself in the throat area repeatedly, holding the weapon with both hands, police said.After he ignored orders to drop the knife, Officer Ron Lemings hit Mendez with a stun gun -- hoping the shock would prevent the suspect from hurting himself further.But it didn't work, and Mendez continued stabbing, police said.When he raised the knife over his head in a threatening manner, facing officers -- who were about 10 feet away, still near the entryway -- Detective Anderson shot him.Mendez fell to the ground, knife in hand. Anderson and Lemings repeatedly asked him to put down the knife, and he finally complied, police said.A crew rushed him to a nearby hospital for emergency surgery.Police learned Thursday that Mendez died of his injuries. His official cause of death remains under investigation, pending an autopsy from the Stanislaus County Coroner's Office.In the follow-up investigation, officials found the confession and suicide note from Mendez -- which were located in the same desk from where he grabbed the blade.The handwritten letter included information on the felony sex crime and his intention to kill himself rather than be taken into police custody, according to the news release.Officers said perhaps Mendez's plan included "suicide by cop," which may explain his behavior that day.Anderson was put on paid administrative leave, which is typically standard operating procedure after a shooting involving police. The 12-year veteran of the department is now back on duty with the Special Victims Unit, police said.Lemings is a 24-year veteran of Modesto police.Neither was hurt.
