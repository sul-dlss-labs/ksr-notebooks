Midwest City Police say they still don't know why a man decided to take a toddler hostage at a Walmart Neighborhood Market, and threaten the child's life.

Police have identified the suspect as 37-year-old Sammie Lamont Wallace. Wallace grabbed the 2-year-old girl from her mother's shopping basket and held a knife to her body. Police say they'd been negotiating with the suspect for several minutes, when he suddenly began counting down and moving the knife toward the girl's body.

Police say they had to use deadly force to protect the girl from Wallace. An officer fired one shot, killing the suspect. The little girl was not hurt.

Wallace did not know the girl or her mother. Police say he had a long criminal record in Dallas, but not in Oklahoma.

The Midwest City Police Department has not identified the family involved. The department says it will release the name of the officer who shot and killed Wallace later into the investigation.
