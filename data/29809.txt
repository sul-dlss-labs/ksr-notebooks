PHOENIX – The passenger in a speeding car died early Monday after the vehicle hit a curb in Peoria, rolled over several times and caught fire, authorities said.

Chase Nelson, 23, of Surprise, was ejected from the car and died after being taken to a hospital, the Peoria Police Department said in a press release.

The crash occurred around 3 a.m. at 83rd and Peoria avenues. The intersection was closed for the investigation for more than five hours.

An officer first saw the white sedan traveling at a high rate of speed northbound on 83rd Avenue near Bell Road and tried to stop it, police said.

The car turned around and sped south on 83rd Avenue, police said. The officer didn’t follow but notified others on the police radio.

The car then lost control while turning west onto Peoria Avenue, police said.

The driver, whose name wasn’t released, was hospitalized with serious injuries that aren’t considered life-threatening.

The incident remains under investigation. Police said speed and impairment may have been factors, although they haven’t yet made an arrest or issued any citations.
