PFLUGERVILLE, Texas (KXAN) — The Texas Rangers and the Travis County District Attorney are investigating after a Pflugerville police officer shot and killed a man early Wednesday morning.

Around midnight, Pflugerville Police officers went to a disturbance call on Lanark Loop, near the intersection of Picadilly Drive and Grand Avenue Parkway, after reports that a man with a gun was trying to force his way into someone’s bedroom.

Police say a man, later identified as Ronald Zavaglia, 72, who lived at the home had a weapon and was trying to break down a door. Moments after police arrived, an officer shot and killed Zavaglia, who they said was still armed.

The officer who discharged the weapon that shot Zavaglia was cleared by a Travis County grand jury.

Pflugerville Police say the officer has been with the department since October 2017 and has five total years of experience.
