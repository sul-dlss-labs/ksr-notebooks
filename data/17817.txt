The Austin County Sheriff held a press conference this morning at 10am to detail the events of a shooting that took place yesterday at 11 AM on Coshatte Road in Bellville, TX. The following press release was issued:

A man armed with a pistol was shot and killed by Austin County Peace Officers Wednesday morning near Bellville. At approximately 11:00 a.m. on June 22, two deputies with the Austin County Sheriff’s Office and a City of Bellville police officer responded to a report of a man with a gun at a trailer house off Coshatte Road east of Bellville.

When the officers tried to talk to the man, he went into the house and later came back outside with the weapon. When the man pointed his gun at officers, the officers opened fire and killed the man.

The man has been identified as Shaun Trevor Walke, 31, of Columbus, TX.

The two deputies have worked five years and 24 years in law enforcement. The Bellville officer has been a peace officer for over nine years.

The officers did not sustain any injuries.

Sheriff’s Deputies had been called to the residence several hours earlier about a domestic disturbance involving gun fire. A woman had fled the scene after she was attacked by Walke. Deputies searched the area at that time but were unable to locate the suspect.

The Austin County Sheriff’s Office contacted the Texas Rangers who are investigating the incident. An autopsy has been ordered.

District Attorney Travis Koehn said the Austin County Grand Jury may review this matter pending the results of the Rangers’ investigation.
