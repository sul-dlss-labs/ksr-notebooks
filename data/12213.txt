With the ascent of Central Missouri from unranked to No. 15 in the WBCA/USA Today Division II Top 25 poll released Tuesday, four Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association schools call the poll home.

MIAA leader Washburn (No. 12), Fort Hays State (18) and Pittsburg State (20) all dropped spots after losses.

The Lady Blues and the Gorillas experienced losses in mid-December tournament play, while the Tigers dropped eight spots after their first two losses overall and first two MIAA losses this past week.

Pitt State dropped three spots, despite a 3-1 record since the last poll. The Gorillas lost to unranked Academy of Art in Las Vegas, then won its last December game against Dixie State in Vegas and opened 2013 with home wins over Nebraska-Kearney and Northwest Missouri.

Pitt State faces road games Thursday against Lincoln and Saturday against Central Missouri, both tough conference outings. Lincoln ousted Pitt State in the first round of the MIAA Tournament last season, propelled by an all-time performance by Arriana Walker, and Pitt State won its first NCAA Tournament game in school history with a win over Central Missouri in Topeka last March.

Gorilla shooters especially warmed up against Northwest Missouri, feeding off the emotion of a court dedication and enthusiastic crowd, and Lauren Brown established a school record with 22 rebounds, 15 in the second half and seven in the first 3:10 after halftime.

Fort Hays lost tough conference road games against Northeastern State (54-44) and Emporia State (69-54) after dominating its first 10 opponents, including a 95-50 win over Central Missouri. The Tigers lost in Emporia despite the efforts of sophomore center Kate Lehman, who had 25 points, 16 rebounds, seven blocked shots and two assists.

Fort Hays and Washburn face off in Hays on Thursday, the first of two MIAA showdowns this week pairing nationally-ranked opponents.

The MIAA features more ranked teams than any other conference, ahead of the Northern Sun (Augustana, Wayne State, Minnesota State-Mankato) and the PSAC (Gannon, Indiana, Bloomsburg).

MIAA standings (MIAA record): Washburn 8-2 (2-0), Truman State 10-2 (3-1), Pittsburg State 9-3 (3-1), Northeastern State 8-4 (3-1), Central Missouri 10-1 (2-1), Missouri Southern 8-3 (2-1), Fort Hays State 10-2 (2-2), Missouri Western 9-3 (2-2), Northwest Missouri 8-4 (2-2), Lincoln 7-5 (2-2), Emporia State 6-5 (1-2), Central Oklahoma 8-4 (1-3), Southwest Baptist 6-6 (1-3), Nebraska-Kearney 4-7 (1-3), Lindenwood 3-8 (0-3).
