But Internal Affairs investigators who went to the accident scene did not uncover any evidence that Officer McGibbon had been drinking, a senior police official said. There were no empty bottles or traces of alcohol in his car and he did not smell of alcohol, the official said.

But because of the late hour and the severe damage to the cars -- suggesting that at least one was traveling at high speed -- investigators were looking into whether alcohol was involved, the official said.

''Right now there is no indication of alcohol from the vehicle, and under the circumstances, they say he just had a couple beers, he was fine,'' the official said. ''It was his day off and he met a few people to have some drinks. Midnight people usually try to keep that schedule.''

Before the accident, Officer McGibbon had dinner with several friends at the New Floridian diner on Flatbush Avenue in Marine Park, the official said. Soraya Melik, a cashier at the diner, said that he had left around 4:30 a.m.

Dominic Otranto, whose windows overlook the intersection where the cars collided, said he was awakened by a sickening crash. ''I heard a loud bang,'' he said. ''I went to the window and all I saw was mangled car. No voices, nothing.''
