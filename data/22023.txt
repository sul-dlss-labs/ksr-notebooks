NEWARK — An off-duty Newark police officer shot and killed a teenager who allegedly tried to rob him today in the city's West Ward, authorities said.

Dawud Culver, 16, tried to rob the officer at gunpoint about 4:45 p.m. on Poe Avenue, said Anthony Ambrose, chief of detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office.

The officer opened fire and struck Culver once in the chest, according to Ambrose, who said the teen fled and dropped his weapon at the scene. Culver was found shortly afterward in East Orange General Hospital, Ambrose said. The teen was transferred to University Hospital in Newark, where he was pronounced dead at 9:41 p.m., Ambrose said.

The incident is the second shooting in two days involving an off-duty Essex County law enforcement officer.

At 1 p.m. Sunday, an off-duty county sheriff’s officer shot at one of two suspects who had fired at the officer while trying to take his vehicle outside his home in Newark, Ambrose said. There were no injuries in that incident.

Ambrose said today's shooting is being investigated by the prosecutor’s professional standards bureau, in conjunction with the Newark Police Department’s Internal Affairs Unit, which is standard procedure with all police-involved shootings.
