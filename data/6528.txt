Fairview Heights, Ill. â€“ A man suspected in two Georgia murders has killed himself during a manhunt in Fairview Heights.

Police say the body of Julian Walker's was found this morning in a wooded area near railroad tracks.

An investigator says Walker shot himself, apparently with the same shotgun he used to fire upon two Fairview Heights officers who tried to question him hours earlier. Neither officer was injured.

The suspect ran away, prompting a manhunt.

Authorities say Walker was wanted in the shooting of his ex-girlfriend's stepfather, 48-year-old Terrence Lott, on Monday and in the killing of his estranged wife, 36-year-old Rosetta Walker, a short time later.
