Phoenix police have identified the man killed in an officer-involved shooting during the weekend as Mark L. Lanza, 23, a police official said Monday.

Lanza was killed early Sunday after police said he fired multiple shots at responding officers, who were alerted that Lanza was burglarizing a condo, Phoenix Police Department spokesman Sgt. Steve Martos said.

Officers said they saw Lanza standing on a patio roof with a gun when they arrived at the complex near 35th and Northern Avenues, Martos said.

Martos said Lanza shot at police and then jumped from the roof into a backyard, where he was shot and killed.

Court records show that Lanza had been released from prison in June after serving time in both juvenile detention and the Department of Corrections following a 2008 armed robbery when Lanza was 17.

In the 2008 case, Lanza confessed to police that he threatened a man at gunpoint and stole $50, records show.

According to court documents, Lanza was a known street gang member. Martos said Lanza also had an outstanding felony warrant for robbery.

Police are investigating the situation and working to determine whether Lanza, was in fact burglarizing the residence which was later determined to be vacant, Martos said.

No officers or bystanders were hurt in the exchange of gunfire, Martos said.
