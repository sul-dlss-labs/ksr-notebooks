The involved officers have been placed on administrative leave, which is standard operating procedure for officer involved shootings. The Texas Rangers are conducting the investigation.

This is the third officer involved shooting this year involving local law enforcement.

In early August officers responding to a domestic situation fatally shot Roberto Hernandez Jr., 29. Officers said Hernandez fled and a slow speed chase followed before he abandoned the vehicle and fled on foot. Hernandez was firing a weapon when he was shot near the O.C. Fisher Dam spillway, police reported at the time.

On Jan. 24, Scott Joseph Weber Jr., 27, was fatally shot after fleeing Tom Green County Sheriff's Office deputies and crashing into a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper's vehicle on West Shiloh Street.

Both of those incidents were under investigation by Texas Rangers, who have not released the findings of their inquiries.
