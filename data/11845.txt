Mohamed Bah had not seemed himself lately. Day after day, the 28-year-old taxi driver failed to show up for work and skipped his classes at Borough of Manhattan Community College. When his mother called from Guinea, Mr. Bah acted as though he did not know her, the police said Wednesday.

“In phone conversations, she would say, ‘Oh, hello, Son,’ and he would say: ‘No, it’s not your son. I’m not Mohamed’ — or words to that effect,” said Paul J. Browne, the Police Department’s chief spokesman.

Mr. Bah’s mother grew so concerned that she traveled to New York City from her home in West Africa to check on him. Around 6:40 p.m. on Tuesday, Mr. Bah was holed up inside his Harlem apartment and would not come out, the police said.

As Mr. Bah’s mother stood outside her son’s apartment on Morningside Avenue, near 124th Street, with one of Mr. Bah’s cousins, they grew increasingly worried. The cousin called 911 and handed the phone to Mr. Bah’s mother, Mr. Browne said.
