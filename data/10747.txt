Wichita Falls Police have identified a man killed in a police shooting that happened Sunday.

Police say the man is 21-year-old Jeffrey Cole Royal.

Police have identified the officers involved in the shooting as well. They are Sgt. John Spragins, a 16 year veteran of the WFPD, Officer Michael Brown, a 2 year veteran and Officer Michael Goins, who has been on the Department for 2 years.

According to Wichita Falls police, at 8:10 p.m. on Sunday, the Wichita Falls Police Department received a call about a man with a gun in the 100 block of Becky. The caller said the man had a rifle and was threatening suicide. Three officers say they found the man in a car with a rifle. Police say when he saw officers approaching, Royal got out of the car to confront the officers. Police opened fire. Wichita Falls police are not saying at this time how many officers opened fire or if the suspect fired a shot. None of the officers were injured.

Members of the WFPD Criminal Investigation Section and Crime Scene Unit were dispatched to the scene.

Neighbors were shaken-up by the incident. "It sounded like fireworks going off and I mean rapid fireworks," said Jim Anthony who lives nearby.

Anthony said the mobile home community is usually quiet. "We hadn't had any problems around here... I've lived here for about 15 years and there some of the best people I've had for neighbors," he said.

As is standard practice, the Police Department's Office of Professional Conduct will conduct a separate investigation. The man's body will be sent to the Tarrant County Coroner's Office for autopsy.
