Waterford Township police shot and killed a suspect Friday morning after he drew a weapon on them, officials said.

Police wanted to speak to the man, who was a suspect in a domestic violence incident in another city, but he led officers on a car chase. Police identified the man as a 56-year-old Fenton resident and said he had assaulted his mother at her home in Bloomfield Township.

“Our department received a call around 12:30 a.m. Friday from Bloomfield Township police that a domestic violence incident was developing and a man had threatened to go to a Waterford address and 'shoot up the home of a family member,'” Waterford Township Police Chief Scott Underwood said.

“Township officers went to the address and advised occupants of the threat and they (occupants) made the decision it would be best to go stay with relatives elsewhere and the officers escorted them safely out of town."

Underwood said officers spotted the suspect’s vehicle and attempted to make a traffic stop on Barkman Stree, near Clintonville, about 4:30 a.m.

During the stop, the suspect pulled out a shotgun and fired at the officers, the chief said.

Police returned fire and killed the suspect, he said. No officers were injured.

Underwood said the matter has been turned over to the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office for investigation. Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave.

He said he is unable to provide any additional information about the man or his intended victims or what even prompted his rage.

The police chief said he is relieved no residents or his officers were injured in the incident and noted shootings involving his department are rare.

“Fortunately these don’t happen with any frequency and we hope we never have another,” he said.
