CHICAGO â€” A Chicago man was fatally shot as he tried to rob an off-duty Chicago police officer who was returning home from work early Sunday, police said.

Qamont Parr, 22, of the 5500 block of South May Street was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, where he was pronounced dead shortly after 11 a.m., according to a Cook County medical examiner's office spokesman.

Parr was one of three men who tried to rob the officer as he parked his car behind his house in the 7100 block of South Champlain Avenue, police said.

A green Dodge van with three men in it and with its parking lights on came into the alley, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

"This was 3:30 in the morning, and he thought that was unusual," Camden said. "He pulls his weapon out at that point and is getting out of his vehicle. The offender is standing at the driver's door, pointing a gun at him."

The officer pushed the car door open, knocking the armed man to the ground, Camden said. As the officer got out of his car, a second armed man appeared and pointed a pistol at him, Camden said.

"This offender actually tried to fire at him. But the offender's weapon misfired," he said. "At this point, the officer opened fire."

The second armed man pointed a gun at the officer again, and the officer fired several shots, Camden said.

Parr was found hiding in the bushes nearby, police said. A man bleeding from a gunshot wound in a knee was found at a nearby hospital, Camden said.

Police were seeking the third man.
