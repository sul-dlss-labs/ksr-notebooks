CROCKETT — An unidentified man was killed Sunday afternoon when a stolen car he was driving careened off the Carquinez Bridge and fell more than 100 feet to the ground, authorities said.

As of Monday afternoon, authorities were still working to figure out the man’s name. His body was so badly burned that it has made identification difficult.

He was the only occupant of the car, police said.

The car landed on the shoreline at the east end of the bridge, near the C&H Factory. California Highway Patrol investigators were still on scene Monday afternoon, surveying both the bridge crash site and the area where the vehicle landed.

According to authorities, the chase started after 6 p.m. Sunday, on Interstate 80, heading eastbound. When the man reached the Carquinez Bridge, around 6:30 p.m., he failed to negotiate a curve and the car he was driving crashed off the side of the elevated section. It burst into flames as it struck the beach below.

Police have not said how fast the car was traveling when it crashed.

The car had been reported stolen, authorities said.

The man’s death is being investigated by the Contra Costa District Attorney’s office, which probes all law-enforcement-related deaths. At some point, a coroner’s inquest jury will be called to review the circumstances surrounding the crash, and make an official determination as to cause of death.

The California Highway Patrol did not immediately respond to requests for more information.
