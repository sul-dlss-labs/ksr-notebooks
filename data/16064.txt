A family wants to know how their loved one died after he slammed into a tree.Family members said they think someone might have been chasing him.Neighbors said they heard a loud boom early Monday morning. They ran outside to see the man’s car smashed into a tree.Watch the story.Ricardo Blackmon died in the crash on Edwards Avenue.“The first part of his car was against this first tree. The second part of his car ended up somehow between these two trees,” said Antonio Blackmon, Ricardo Blackmon’s brother.“The officer noticed the vehicle driving at a high rate of speed with no headlights. He turned around and tried to catch up with it,” said Chief Lee Vance of the Jackson Police Department. “Before he even got close to this individual, he turned off of Northside Drive and crashed.”Friends said they last saw Ricardo Blackmon at a nearby gas station around 10 p.m. Sunday. He crashed about two hours later.Yolanda Wade, Ricardo Blackmon’s mother, said she thinks there is more to the story than what police are saying.“My son was a very caring person. He loved everybody. I just want some answers. I need some closure right now,” Wade said.Antonio Blackmon said there are two sets of tire tracks on the street and he thinks an officer chased his brother.“They told us that there wasn’t a chase, that he was just speeding, but the witnesses at the store say he was being chased by a police officer,” Antonio Blackmon said.“Was this a police chase? Absolutely not. This individual, again, was driving one way. The officer was going the other,” Vance said.Anyone with information about the crash is asked to call police.Investigators are waiting for autopsy results to determine if Ricardo Blackmon was driving under the influence, Vance said.
