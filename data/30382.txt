BAYONNE, N.J. (CBSNewYork) -- A man who neighbors said was armed with a knife died Monday after an encounter with police in Bayonne.

The quiet neighborhood was swarmed with investigators hours after the deadly police-involved shooting Monday, CBS2's Kevin Rincon reported.

Police responded to a 911 call about an alleged domestic incident at a home on West 1st Street around 6:30 a.m., according to the New Jersey Attorney General's Office.

After police arrived, "one or more officers" opened fire on a man who lived there, the AG's office said.

The man later died from his injuries. There were no immediate details from officials on what happened before the shooting.

"He must've pulled a knife out and the cop shot him," said Marisol Velez, a neighbor.

"We were really surprised because I didn't hear anything," said another.

Velez consoled the family of the man who died. They told her they called police for help after some sort of mental health situation.

"If I need help, I want help. I don't want a police officer with hot hands and a gun. I can do that myself," said Velez. "We don't have those institutions like we used to. They just pop pills into you and send you back home, and then they expect the police to be everything. They can't be everything."

Neighbors said they wish this entire situation could've been avoided.

"Usually we don't have many problems here," a neighbor said.

The AG's office is now handling the investigation, as it does with all fatal police shootings.

Rincon watched as ammunition from a service weapon left at the scene was being closely examined. It's unclear how many shots were fired or who pulled the trigger.

The identity of the man who was killed has not been released.
