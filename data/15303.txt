The Riverside County Coroner’s Office has identified an Indio man killed by police during a standoff nearly two weeks ago.

Jesus Orduno Luviano, 20, was shot by officers on Shields Road near Highway 111 at about 11:30 p.m. Nov. 2.

Luviano brandished a shotgun, and ignored officers who demanded that he drop the weapon, according to a news release from the sheriff’s department. Luviano fired his shotgun once before officers opened fire.

Officers from the Indio Police Department and the California Highway Patrol responded to the scene. At this point, it is unclear if the officers who shot Luviano were from the police department, the highway patrol or both. The officers who pulled the trigger have not been identified.

No officers were injured.

The shooting is being investigated by the sheriff department’s homicide unit.

It began when highway patrol officers spotted what appeared to be an intoxicated driver on Highway 111 near Jefferson Street. The officers attempted to pull over the driver, but at first he didn’t stop.

Luviano drove about half a mile, with patrol officers on his tail, before he eventually stopped near Shields Road south of Highway 111.

After stopping, the suspect stepped out of his car holding a shotgun, sparking the conflict that eventually lead to his death.
