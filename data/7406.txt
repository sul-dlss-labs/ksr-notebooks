A man who led police on a chase through East Los Angeles before crashing his SUV in Rosemead and is accused of firing at officers from the burning vehicle died at the scene shortly after 2 p.m. Saturday, authorities said.

The chase started about 1:30 p.m. in central Los Angeles and ended when the suspect crashed near Walnut Grove and Garvey avenues in Rosemead about half an hour later, said LAPD spokeswoman Norma Eisenman.

No officers were hurt in the incident, said Eisenman, who added that officers had pursued the vehicle because they believed it was connected to a homicide investigation.
