(Florence-AP) February 2, 2006 - State officials are investigating a shooting involving a police officer that ended with two people being killed.

McColl Police Chief Warren McCall says one of his officers is on administrative leave while Tuesday night's shooting is investigated by the State Law Enforcement Division. The officer was not identified.

Police say when officers were called to an apparent domestic dispute, Pamela Goins and her boyfriend, Howard Scott, had already been shot. Investigators say one officer became involved in the shooting.

Goins and Scott died later at a local hospital. Marlboro County Coroner Tim Brown says it was unclear who shot whom.
