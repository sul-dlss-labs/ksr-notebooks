ELK – A 19-year-old Millville man faces a death by automobile charge following the crash of his pickup truck along Route 55 on Tuesday morning, resulting in the death of his teenage passenger.

New Jersey State Police on Thursday identified Jacob Servais as the driver of a 2007 Dodge Durango that drove into the median near Exit 48, hit a tree and caught fire. Investigation into the 9:55 a.m. incident is continuing.

Lt. Ted Schafer said the passenger was a 17-year-old Vineland resident, but his name is not being released because he was a minor. The teen was pronounced dead at Jefferson Washington Township Hospital, he said. Servais was taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden and is in serious condition.

Schafer said Franklin Township police had been chasing Servais northbound on Route 55, but police had broken off pursuit prior to the accident.

. Franklin police Lt. Matthew DeCesari said the township officer’s chase started around Exit 39. The pickup truck was speeding in the northbound lane, he said.

“When the driver started to drive more erratically, the officer broke off,” DeCesari said.

DeCesari said the township has charged Servais with resisting arrest by eluding and several motor vehicle violations.

The death by auto charge was filed at the direction of the Gloucester County Prosecutor’s Office and other charges are possible, Schafer said.

Schafer said the accident closed both northbound lanes for about 30 minutes. The right lane reopened then, but the left lane stayed closed for five hours, he said.
