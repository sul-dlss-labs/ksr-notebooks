Milwaukee police on Monday identified the man who was shot to death by officers Saturday as Chris G. Nowicki, 46.

Physical and video evidence corroborates the officers' statements that Nowicki was coming at them while holding two butcher knives about 10:30 p.m. Saturday and refused orders to drop the knives, said Sgt. Mark Stanmeyer, police spokesman.

The shooting occurred outside a residence in the 2600 block of S. 71st St. The officer who fired the shot is 47 and has nearly 21 years with the Milwaukee Police Department. He is assigned to District 6.

The Police Department and the Milwaukee County district attorney's office continue to investigate the shooting, and the officers involved in the incident remain on administrative duty pending the completion of the investigation.

It was the second deadly officer-involved shooting in Milwaukee within a week.

Police killed a 45-year-old man Wednesday in the 7200 block of W. Mill Road who was threatening to commit suicide and refused to drop his weapon.
