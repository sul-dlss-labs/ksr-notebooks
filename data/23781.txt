A 36-year-old man shot and injured his sister before killing himself near Winter Springs early Thursday morning, according to the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office.

Deputies were called at about 7:20 p.m. Wednesday to a home in the 1300 block of Via Villanova Way, which is in the Rising Sun subdivision near Red Bug Lake and Tuskawilla roads.

The suspect was armed with a handgun and fired several rounds at his 31-year-old sister, striking her multiple times, sheriff’s office spokeswoman Kim Cannaday said.

The victim escaped and ran to a neighbor’s house. She was hospitalized and is in stable condition.

The suspect and his mother, who is 72, refused to leave the home. Crisis negotiators communicated with him for almost five hours before he shot and killed himself at about 1:20 a.m. Thursday, Cannaday said.

The mother was not injured, Cannaday said.
