A Jim Thorpe man was shot and killed by a state trooper Wednesday night during an armed standoff in Pike County, state police said.

Nicholas J. Cantelmi, 31, was fatally wounded by a member of the state police’s special response team inside the cabin where Cantelmi had holed up, police said. Cantelmi was shot after he brandished a firearm as troopers entered the cabin to arrest him, police said initial reports indicate.

Police said Cantelmi was wanted on a parole violation in Carbon County. He barricaded himself in the cabin after fleeing police during a traffic stop about 11 a.m. in which he “intentionally struck one police vehicle.”

The shooting followed a seven-hour standoff in Porter Township in which negotiators sought to persuade Cantelmi to surrender peacefully, according to a news release. Police also used tear gas and flash-bang explosives to try to get Cantelmi to exit, police said.

During the standoff, Cantelmi fired shots from inside the Pine Flats Road cabin, police said.

The Pike County District Attorney’s Office and the state police are conducting a joint investigation into whether the use of lethal force was justified, police said.

Cantelmi was pronounced dead at the scene by the Pike County Coroner’s Office. No police officers were injured, police said.

Porter Township, a rural community of less than 500 people, is situated in the Poconos about 20 miles north of Stroudsburg.
