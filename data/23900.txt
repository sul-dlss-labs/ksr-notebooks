POTTSTOWN >> The Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office has launched an investigation into an officer-involved shooting in Pottstown late Thursday night that left a man dead.

At 11:25 p.m. Thursday, Pottstown Police responded to a wellness check for a suicidal man just a block from the police station at 40 E. High St., according to the Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office.

Police were informed that the man had posted photos online of himself holding a gun to his head and threatening to harm himself.

When police arrived, officers encountered the armed man in the parking lot and confronted him. At that time, an officer discharged his firearm and struck the man. The man was then transported via medical helicopter to Reading Hospital Trauma Center in West Reading, where he was later pronounced dead.

A BB/pellet gun was recovered near the suspect, according to the district attorney’s office.

Per policy, the name of the police officer involved as well as the suspect’s name are not being released at this time.

Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office investigators combed the scene behind the Guardian Apartments and a forensics truck was still at the scene as of 8 a.m. Friday.

This incident is the third officer-involved shooting in Montgomery County over the past two weeks. The Montgomery County District Attorney’s Office announced an investigation into an officer-involved shooting in Norristown on Feb. 28 as well as one in Abington Township on March 5.
