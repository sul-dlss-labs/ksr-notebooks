Prosecutors on Thursday charged a driver with killing his passenger when he fled from Arcadia police in a stolen car and collided with three other vehicles in Temple City.

Sarah Ardalani, spokeswoman for the District Attorney’s Office, said 28-year-old Richard John Villareal of Arcadia was charged with the June 2 murder of Michael Sandoval Jr.

Villareal’s arraignment on Thursday at Pasadena Superior Court was continued to June 19, court officials said.

Sandoval died at the scene of the crash on Lower Azusa Road and Arden Drive in Temple City. Deputies investigating the collision said Villareal ended up with moderate injures and another driver complained of pain.

Authorities allege Villareal was driving a stolen Honda Accord and allege he was fleeing from Arcadia police just before the crash.

The car was seen around 11:30 a.m. on Workman and Baldwin avenues in Arcadia by an officer who discovered it was stolen May 31 from Monterey Park.

Officers later tried to pull over the Accord on Santa Anita Avenue but the driver took off.

Arcadia police claim they called off the pursuit before the fatal crash.

The Accord ran a red light on Lower Azusa Road and Arden Drive in Temple City and was struck by a Toyota Avalon, deputies said. The Accord then hit two Toyota Siennas.

Villareal remains in custody.
