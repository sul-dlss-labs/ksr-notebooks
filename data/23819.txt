The Kansas Bureau of Investigation has identified the man killed during an exchange of gunfire with authorities on Monday.

Ethan M. Straub, 25, of Wamego, was killed during the incident, which involved multiple law enforcement agencies, KBI spokeswoman Melissa Underwood said on Wednesday.

Officers were called Monday evening to Kreem Kup Drive In, 601. W. US-24 highway, after receiving a report of an armed carjacking.

The suspect was seen a short time later and authorities tried to contact him on 8th Street, between Maple and Pine, as he allegedly tried to steal another vehicle, the Kansas Highway Patrol said.

Gunfire was exchanged between Straub and officers of the Kansas Highway Patrol, Pottawatomie County Sheriff's Office, Wamego Police Department and St. George Police Department.

Straub was pronounced dead on the scene.

No officers were injured, though one officer was taken to a hospital as a precaution stemming from a health concern.

The KBI is investigating, and the agency's findings will be turned over to the Pottawatomie County Attorney for review, Underwood said.
