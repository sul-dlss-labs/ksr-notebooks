Search statistics about crashes during police pursuits over the past decade from 2006 to 2015 in Michigan:

The numbers include crash resorts from police agencies across the state, recorded by the Michigan State Police.

The stats include information about which agency wrote the crash report, but do not show which police agency was involved in the crash. The numbers do not include "deliberate intent collisions," the state police said.

The most recent data from 2015 comes from a live database and may be subject to change if reports are updated, the Michigan State Police said.
