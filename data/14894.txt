? The Kansas Highway Patrol says a 23-year-old man died when his truck went into a river as he was fleeing from police.

The patrol says Timothy Wayne Charboneau, of Erie, died Tuesday evening in an accident on a road about 1 mile south of Erie in Neosho County.

The patrol says Charboneau failed to yield to an Erie police officer during a chase and his truck left the road, went through a guardrail and came to rest on its top in the Neosho River.

The patrol did not say what prompted the police chase.
