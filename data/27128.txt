The widow of a man fatally shot by a St. Helena Parish sheriff’s deputy at his Independence home on Monday evening said her husband was armed with an assault rifle when he answered the door, after she pleaded with him to drop his weapon and surrender.

Her version of events confirms initial reports from the Sheriff’s Office that said Antonio Nichols, 47, was armed, though it conflicts with the account of a neighbor who reported witnessing the encounter but saw no weapon when Nichols spoke to deputies.
