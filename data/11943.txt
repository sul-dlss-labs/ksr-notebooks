A Marion County Grand Jury announced Friday that the Salem police officer involved in the fatal shooting of a 22-year-old man in October was justified in his use of deadly force.



Officers tried to stop a stolen vehicle Dru Garrett Larson was driving on Oct. 17 when Larson began a chase through downtown Salem, said Marion County Deputy District Attorney Matt Kemmy. Larson eventually crashed the vehicle near the intersection of Liberty and Grove streets in Northeast Salem.



Larson ignored orders to surrender and show his hands to police, Kemmy said, and tried to drive away. Officers broke the driver's door window with a baton to try and get Larson out of the car, and though he momentarily surrendered, he then put the car in reverse, driving toward two officers before hitting a patrol car.



As he reversed toward the officers, Officer Rogers Smith fired four shots that hit Larson, Kemmy said. Those shots eventually caused his death.



Officer Laura Seefelt fired once, but only hit the car. The grand jury also determined her actions were justified.



A toxicology report showed Larson tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine at the time of his death, Kemmy said. The report was presented to the grand jury, along with the testimony of 13 witnesses â€” seven police officers and six civilians.
