A Mecklenburg County ABC Agent was shot in the leg just before midnight Friday. The shooting occurred at Sensations night club, located on Woodlawn Road, near I-77. The suspect was killed during the gunfire exchange and a club bouncer suffered a bullet wound to the arm.

Police say Officers Terry Mack and Robert Bates with Mecklenburg County’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board had arrived at the club to conduct a routine inspection of the property. They were attempting to break up a disturbance outside the club when the victim, Jose Ernesto Hernandez-Navarrete, pulled out a gun and began shooting. Police believe other suspects were involved in the shooting but they didn’t provide any further details.
