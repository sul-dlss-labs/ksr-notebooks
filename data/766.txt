Stockton Briefs

Mayor Gary Podesto said Tuesday

that the council had narrowed the list of candidates for the city manager position.

Podesto said the council discussed

the matter and revised the list during a closed session meeting before Tuesday's

regular meeting. But he declined to say specifically how many candidates remain

except that it is "between one and four."

Podesto said he did not want to

reveal the number of remaining candidates because he fears that doing so would

prematurely tell some candidates that they are no longer being considered.

The council plans to invite the

remaining candidate or candidates back for further interviews March 1, Podesto

said.

The city's top staff position is

open because long-time City Manager Dwane Milnes retired this month.
