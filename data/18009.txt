PALM BAY, Fla. – Palm Bay police killed a man who shot his wife during a domestic dispute, according to authorities.

Officers received a call at 7:17 p.m. Tuesday from a woman in a Lockheed Street home who said her husband, 43-year-old DeMarco Newman was cutting himself with glass and was armed with a gun threatening to kill her, according to Lt. Mike Bandish with PBPD.

“While we were responding, she said she was barricading herself in the bathroom, and we sent units right away,” Bandish said.

While the officers were on their way, Bandish said the woman was screaming on the phone, saying that Newman was breaking in the door when her phone went dead.

Officers set up a perimeter, but no longer had a point of contact. The sheriff’s department, aided with the use of a bomb squad robot, entered the home. When SWAT members breached the door, they heard the victim saying she’d been shot.

"She stated that she was shot and could not move," said Chief Mark Renkens. "She stated that her husband was in the bathroom with her and that he was armed."

Bandish said SWAT decided to go into the house to make the rescue.

Police engaged the suspect about 10:45 p.m. and Sgt. Tom Ribnicky shot and killed Newman after the 43-year-old threatened the lives of rescuers, officials said.

"The suspect began to taunt and challenge the officers, stating that he was armed," said Renkens.

Bandish said that FDLE will investigate the shooting, a protocol for officer-involved shootings.

A First Flight helicopter took the woman to Holmes Regional Medical Center with gunshot wounds.

Police did not release her name Wednesday.

Authorities say Newman was wheelchair-bound, his lower body paralyzed after being shot in a different incident three years ago.

Neighbors say since then, his relationship with his wife was very troubled.

Ribnicky was placed on paid administrative leave.
