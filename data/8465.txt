VAN NUYS (CBS) — A 31-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to multiple life terms for leading police on a chase that resulted in a pedestrian's death in Woodland Hills.

Kelly Keller, of Ladera Heights, was convicted Jan. 17 of second-degree murder for the death of 66-year-old Dean William Greenwalt. He was also found guilty of attempted murder on a peace officer, assault with a semi-automatic firearm on a peace officer, felony evading causing death, resisting an officer and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Jurors found Feb. 6 that Keller was sane at the time of the crimes.

The defendant fatally struck Greenwalt in a Woodland Hills crosswalk on Sept. 26, 2009 while driving his Cadillac sedan.

The California Highway Patrol initially began pursuing him after unsuccessfully trying to stop him for a traffic violation on the southbound Ventura (101) Freeway in Calabasas. The defendant went on to rear-end a sport-utility vehicle, with four people inside, on Ventura Boulevard and opened fire on CHP officers, authorities said. No one was struck by the gunfire.
