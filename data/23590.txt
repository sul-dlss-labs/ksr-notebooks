Lee County deputies, responding to a domestic violence incident, were confronted by an armed suspect who was shot and killed after the person pointed a gun at deputies.

The officer-involved shooting happened on Dupont Drive in San Carlos Park at 4:23 p.m.

The name of the deceased person was not released.

Lee County Undersheriff Carmine Marceno declined to take questions during a news conference, but said deputies were called to a home in the 18000 block of Dupont Drive for a domestic violence incident.

Deputies ensured the safety of the person who called 911, but when they searched the residence they found one subject with a gun.

"That suspect pointed that firearm at our deputies who were then forced to engage the suspect with deadly force," Marceno said. "The suspect is now deceased and our deputies are uninjured."

The deputies have been placed on administrative leave, per sheriff's office policy, he said.

Yellow police tape closed off the roadway at Morgan Road and Dupont Drive. At least a dozen patrol cars are stationed in the neighborhood.

Robert Dougherty, 44, who lives nearby, said he was reroofing his home when he saw patrol cars arriving in the neighborhood.

"There's not much officers present in this part of San Carlos Park at all," Dougherty said. "It's really quiet around here."

Dougherty said he was not familiar with the people who live at the home. He said he has lived there since 2001.

"I am just glad the officers are all right and my heart and prayers go out to the family of the victim that was shot," Dougherty said. "I'm glad no one else got hurt."

In September of last year, 54-year-old Debi Lynn Thorkelson was killed in an officer-involved shooting with a Lee deputy on Fort Myers Beach. The sheriff's office is also investigating that shooting.
