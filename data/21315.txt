Tune in at 9 p.m. Monday for the inaugural broadcast of “News @ 9” on WADL TV 38. The partnership between WADL and Journal Register Newspapers will feature local reporting and video coverage from reporters and videographers working at the Daily Tribune, The Macomb Daily, The Oakland Press and Mt. Pleasant’s Morning Sun, as well as national and international news.

“For me having been a news director, bringing together newspaper journalism and streaming video into a real partnership with TV is unique,” said Steve Antoniotti, WADL TV 38 general manager.

The newscast, which will also feature Bloomberg financial news and sports reporting, will be anchored by Makenzi Henderson and Macomb County native and meteorologist Eric Garlick.

Viewers in the region need a 9 p.m. newscast, Antoniotti said.

That’s because many don’t arrive home in time to catch an early evening newscast and others head to bed before the late shows.

“The ‘News @ 9’ is perfect for them,” he said.

Kevin Haezebroeck, senior vice president of Journal Register Newspapers in Michigan, said, “We are excited about the partnership with WADL TV 38.

“Our footprint in southeast Michigan matches up very well with WADL TV 38 in Wayne, Oakland, Macomb and Washtenaw counties. We cover the top news of the day with extensive video reports in each of these markets, and it will be great to be able to expand the reach of our superb journalism.”
