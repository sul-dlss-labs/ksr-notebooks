PHENIX CITY, Ala. — WRBL News 3 is on the scene where an armed standoff has just ended with the suspect’s apparent suicide.

News 3’s Joe Ripley went to the home along 13th Street in Phenix City where the incident took place.

Phenix City Police say they received a call from a concerned family member who told them a woman was being held at the house against her will. The man she alleged had kept her in the house was armed. Officers say the man slammed the door in their face when initially confronted. Police then set up a perimeter around the residence and tried to negotiate the hostage situation.

PCPD sent the Special Response Team and a hostage negotiator to the home to try and get the people outside. Officers say the woman was held for a few hours before the suspect released her.

Around 10 a.m., five hours after the standoff started, police heard a single gunshot, went inside, and discovered the man dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound.

This incident is under investigation by the Phenix City Police Department, Criminal Investigations Division. The Russell County Coroner’s Office is withholding the name of the suspect until his next-of-kin can be notified. The relationship between the suspect and woman was unclear.

News 3 learned the man has an outstanding warrant with the Muscogee County Sheriff’s Office. Police say the warrant is Georgia Probation Violation tied to Terroristic Threats and Acts.This is a developing story. Stay with WRBL News 3 for updates.
