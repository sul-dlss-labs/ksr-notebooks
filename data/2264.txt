A Council Bluffs man was killed Monday evening when he wrecked his car while being pursued by a sheriff's deputy.

Eric Clevenger, 19, 2424 Sixth Ave., died in the one-car accident about three-fourths of a mile south of Weston on Iowa Highway 191, Pottawattamie County Sheriff Jeff Danker said. He and a sister were apparently returning home after dropping their father off at work in Underwood.

A Pottawattamie County deputy was northbound on Iowa Highway 191 at 5:45 p.m. when he spotted a southbound 1993 Nissan Sentra traveling at a high rate of speed, Danker said.

"From what I understand, they originally clocked him at 84 miles per hour," he said.

The deputy turned around to initiate a traffic stop.

The car sped up after the deputy began following him, Danker said.

"His license was revoked, so that was probably the reason," he said.

In his efforts to escape the deputy, the driver attempted to pass another vehicle on the right, Danker said. About the time the deputy turned on his flashing lights, Clevenger lost control of his car, which left the highway and came to rest in the east ditch.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, Danker said. His sister, passenger Bailey Clevenger, 13, was taken by Underwood Fire & Rescue to Jennie Edmundson Hospital, where she was treated and released.
