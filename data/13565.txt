An armed man who was shot by Florissant police early Sunday died of a self-inflicted wound, according to an investigation by St. Louis County police.

Florissant police went to the home of Abayomi Afolabi, 44, in north St. Louis County just before 6 a.m. after an earlier domestic disturbance call at his ex-wife's house.

He brandished a gun and Florissant police opened fire, according to St. Louis County police. He was hit in the arm and side, according to the county police investigation into the incident, but he died from a self-inflicted shot to the head.

The confrontation began when Florissant police got a call about a domestic disturbance at the home of Afolabi's ex-wife n the first block of Regina Drive on Sunday morning.

Police said Afolabi had been to his ex-wife's home a few days before and banged on the door to get in. He returned Sunday and again banged on the door. She didn't let him in and police were called.

Afolabi was gone when police arrived. They went to his home in the 10100 block of Winkler Drive in unincorporated St. Louis County.

When police arrived, Afolabi ran from the front door and got into his vehicle in the driveway. He rammed a Florissant police car with his vehicle, pushing it back several feet, according to police. An officer was inside the car but was not injured.

The Florissant officers saw Afolabi had a handgun and saw him fire it at his own head. At about the same moment, one of the officers, fearing for their safety, fired two shots at Afolabi.

Afolabi was pronounced dead at the scene. St. Louis County police found a handgun and a spent shell casing in his car.

A friend of Afolabi said he was a driver for Laclede Cab.
