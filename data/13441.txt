ST. PETERSBURG â€” A man is dead after threatening a police officer with an ax.

The officers were responding to a call about a man carrying an ax and making threats near downtown St. Petersburg on Monday evening.

As the first officer approached, he saw a group of four to six people running in fear. Then the officer saw the suspect rounding the corner, holding a large ax. The officer says the man was making unintelligible statements. The man ran at a fast pace toward the officer, who drew his firearm and yelled for the man to stop and drop the ax.

When the man was about seven feet away, the officer fired multiple times. The 27-year-old man was pronounced dead by paramedics. Investigators identified him on Tuesday as Kenneth Robert Sprankle.
