Dubuque student who fell from roof has died

A University of Dubuque wrestler who fell from a second-story window of a home during a police raid of an underage drinking party last month, has now died from his injuries.

Nineteen-year-old Shane Frederick was one of several people attending a drinking party at a Dubuque home. When police arrived to break up the party, Frederick climbed out a second story window to avoid arrest. He slipped from the overhand and fell nearly 24 feet, landing face-first onto the concrete.

Frederick was taken to University Hospitals in Iowa City where he remained on life support since the fall. Frederick was declared dead Monday.
