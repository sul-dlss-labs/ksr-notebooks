FOLLANSBEE, W.Va. — A Brooke County man was shot and killed by police Friday night after officers said he threatened them with a knife.

A caller to Brooke County 911 reported that a man, later identified as Clifton Reintzel, 53, was cutting himself with a knife while a woman screamed in the background.

West Virginia state police spokesman Lt. Michael Baylous said when the trooper arrived with a Brooke County deputy and a Follansbee police officer they heard the woman screaming inside. The officers then decided to force entry.

Baylous said Reintzel “charged toward the officers in a threatening manner with a knife.” The officers responded by firing on Reintzel, who died later at Weirton Medical Center.
