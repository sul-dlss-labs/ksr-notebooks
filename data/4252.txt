A second man involved in a police chase and car crash last month on the city's West Side has died, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Charles Evans, 25, was pronounced dead Friday morning at Mt. Sinai Hospital. Evans, who had been in the back seat of a Buick sedan that he and two other men were riding in when it crashed May 26, had been on life support, police said.

Chicago police, responding to a report of an attempted abduction, pursued the Buick, but the chase was called off for safety reasons, police said.

The car later slammed into a utility pole at Roosevelt Road and Central Avenue and caught fire, police said.

The officer who had been pursuing the Buick came upon the accident and used a fire extinguisher on the flames then pulled the three men from the car, police said.

Toteka D. Robinson, 18, died that day.

The only person to survive the crash, Dwayne Stevens, was charged with attempted kidnapping with a firearm, aggravated possession of a stolen vehicle and two counts of aggravated driving under the influence.
