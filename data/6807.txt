LIMA, Ohio -- A judge has approved a $2.5 million wrongful death settlement in the fatal shooting of an unarmed woman by a police officer. The shooting during a drug raid in 2008 set off protests about police treatment of minorities.

An Allen County Probate Court judge on Thursday approved the payment from the city of Lima's insurance company to the family of Tarika Wilson, The Lima News reported. The black woman was shot by a white police officer when police raided her home in the northwest Ohio city on Jan. 4, 2008. Officers were looking for Wilson's boyfriend, who later pleaded guilty to drug trafficking.

Wilson, the 26-year-old mother of six children, was holding her 1-year-old son, Sincere. He was shot in the shoulder and hand.

Lima police Sgt. Joseph Chavalia was acquitted of charges of negligent homicide and negligent assault in the shooting. He testified that he heard gunfire and thought his life was in danger. The shots came from officers shooting at dogs in another part of the home.

Wilson's family and survivors will get about $1.36 million of the settlement money, and attorneys will receive a portion, the newspaper reported.

The wrongful death settlement did not include more than $253,000 the judge approved to go to Wilson's son for his injuries from the raid. The boy also has a claim in the wrongful death portion.

Attorney Cheryl Washington, representing Wilson's mother, told the judge that the boy is expected to recover full use of his arm.

Washington and the city's legal department did not immediately return calls on Friday. A telephone number for Wilson's mother, Darla Jennings, was not immediately available.
