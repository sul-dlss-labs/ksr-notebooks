San Diego police shot and killed a 59-year-old man armed with a gun early Monday at an apartment in the San Ysidro neighborhood, police said.

Police had answered a 911 “hang-up” call around 1 a.m., according to Lt. Paul Rorrison of the San Diego Police Department.

A male caller “stated that he wanted to shoot a female, before the phone was disconnected,” Rorrison said.

When the door opened at the apartment, police were confronted with a man wielding a gun, Rorrison said.

Police retreated down a stairway but the man followed them, pointing the gun at officers, Rorrison said. Three officers opened fire. The man was declared dead at a local trauma center.

The gun held by the man proved to be a replica, Rorrison said.

None of the officers was injured. A 59-year-old female relative of the man was found in the apartment, unharmed, Rorrison said.

On Friday, the Police Department released the name of the man: Alberto Hernandez.

Also released were the names of the officers: Jeffrey McCoy, who has been with the department for 18 months, and Jonathan Wells and Brandon Lull, each of whom has been with the department for a year.
