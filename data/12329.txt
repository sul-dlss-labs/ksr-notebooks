HARLINGEN (AP) – Harlingen police are looking into what set off an 87-year-old man who shot his wife, then opened fire on police who shot and killed him.

Police responding to a family disturbance call Sunday saw Price Perrin shoot his wife, Barbara, in the street in front of their home. When police ordered him to drop his gun, he fired at them. Officers returned fire, killing him.

Police Sgt. Dave Osborne says results from an autopsy on Perrin are pending. Perrin’s wife remained hospitalized Monday in critical condition.

Price Robinson Perrin, 87, shot his wife shortly before 1 p.m. Sunday in the street in front of their house in the Cottonwood Creek Country Club, said Sgt. Dave Osborne, Harlingen police spokesman.

Police saw Barbara Perrin get shot in the torso after they arrived at the couple’s home in the 1300 block of Maple Avenue in response to a family disturbance, Osborne said. He then fired at officers, who had ordered him to drop his weapon. Police returned fire, fatally wounding Perrin.
