The man who authorities said rear-ended a marked patrol vehicle, then advanced on a deputy in a fatal confrontation, was identified as 42-year-old Pedro Rubio, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office.

Rubio was shot July 13 after he advanced toward a deputy and failed to respond to his commands, according to Sgt. Joaquin Enriquez, Sheriff's Office spokesman.

The deputy was identified as Jason Blair, who joined the Sheriff's Office in 2004.

The confrontation occurred about noon on Blair's lunch break, as he was visiting a restaurant in the shopping complex at the southwest corner of Dysart and McDowell roads in Goodyear, Enriquez said.

Rubio collided with Blair's parked patrol vehicle and then got out, advancing with a knife, Enriquez said. Blair ordered him to stop but the man continued to approach. Enriquez said Blair "fired his duty weapon in self-defense."

Rubio died of his injuries. Blair was not hurt.

Blair did not activate his body-worn camera before the shooting, Enriquez said.

Several civilians witnessed the confrontation, Enriquez said.

Following standard policy, the shooting will be reviewed by the Sheriff's Office's Professional Standards Bureau. Blair has been placed on paid administrative leave.

This was the 23rd police shooting in Maricopa County in 2017, with 15 fatalities reported.
