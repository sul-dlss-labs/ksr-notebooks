CORRECTION: Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story said the suspect was taken to a cell, where he went into medical arrest. The suspect was taken into custody at the scene and brought into an open space when he went into medical distress. He later died at a hospital.

A suspect died this weekend after being taken into Long Beach police custody shortly after he allegedly entered employee vehicles on private industrial property in the 6200 block of Paramount Avenue in Long Beach.

The man, who has not yet been identified, was spotted by two security guards who pursued the man, police said. At one point the suspect tried to take the vehicle of one of the security guards; when that failed, he attempted to scale a nearby fence before being detained by the guards.

Long Beach police arrived on scene shortly after 6:45 p.m. Saturday and took the suspect into their custody and moved him into an “open space,” at which point the suspect went into medical distress, according to a spokesman for the department.

Officers attempted life-saving measures and paramedics arrived and transported the subject to a local hospital; however, he was pronounced dead upon arrival.

As with all in-custody deaths, homicide detectives are conducting an investigation. In addition, the Los Angeles County Coroner’s office will also conduct an independent investigation.

This is the second in-custody death this year for the Long Beach Police Department, with the first coming just a month ago after a women who was arrested for possession of narcotics died while in a holding cell.
