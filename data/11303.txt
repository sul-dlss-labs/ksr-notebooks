A policeman shot and killed a man who was firing a shotgun in an Aurora residential neighborhood and then aimed the weapon at police officers late Friday night, officials say.

The man was rushed to an Aurora hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, according to Frank Fania, Aurora police spokesman.

The name of the suspect has not been released, Fania said. No officers or bystanders were injured.

The officer who shot the man was placed on administrative leave pending a review, Fania said. His name was not released.

Police were called to East 28th Avenue and Atchison Street at 11 p.m. Friday after receiving numerous emergency calls. Officers who were patrolling in the same area also reported hearing the gunshots.

Numerous officers responded and soon spotted a man inside a detached garage at a home in the 2700 block of North Atchison Street.

The police officers could see holes that appeared to be from two shotgun blasts in the door of the garage.

Several officers surrounded the garage as the man walked out the door and into the backyard with a shotgun in his hands, Fania said.

The suspect fired one round, but it is unclear if he was pointing the gun at anyone, Fania said.

The man then came into view of other officers, still holding the shotgun.

Police officers identified themselves and ordered the man to drop the shotgun. The suspect refused, turned toward the officers and pointed the weapon at them.

A uniformed officer fired one round from his handgun, striking the suspect and seriously wounding him.

Detectives from the Aurora Police Homicide/Major Crimes Unit were interviewing several officers and witnesses.

The case will be presented to the Adams County District Attorneyâ€™s Office for a final review.
