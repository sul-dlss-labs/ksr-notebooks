An Escatawpa man died Thursday, and according to the Jackson County Sheriff, one of his deputies shot him. The shooting happened Thursday morning on Roberts Road in Escatawpa.

Sheriff Mike Byrd told WLOX News his deputies got a call that a man had a gun in the area. Byrd said when deputies arrived at the home, the suspect came out of the house armed with the gun.

Byrd said the man was asked more than once to drop his weapon.

"Told him several times to put the gun down, put the gun down, and he did not put the gun down and pointed it at the officers," Byrd said.

The sheriff said that's when one of the deputies shot the man.

"This is a tragedy for everybody involved. Officers certainly don't want to have to use lethal force, but sometimes that is the only alternative they have."

The victim later died at the hospital. Sheriff Byrd would not say where or how many times the man was shot. And neither his name, nor the deputy's name are being released at this time.

Sheriff Byrd has called in the Mississippi Bureau of Investigations to look into the incident.

"Anytime we have an officer involved shooting, I want a separate agency to come an look at this, and make sure everything is okay."

No matter what the investigation eventually finds, this small neighborhood is in shock.

Neighbor Scott Stork said, "He was disabled, he lived at home with his parents. Maybe it contributed to the pain, he had broke his neck. But I don't know, you never know."
