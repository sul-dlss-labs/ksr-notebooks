A man is dead and his wife is in the hospital after an officer involved shooting in Selma Monday night.

The Selma Police Chief says officers were called to the 2300 block of Azalea around 7 Monday night.

When officers arrived they discovered a woman covered in blood who had run to a neighbors house after being stabbed.

Investigators say they then found the victim’s husband on the roof of a home in the neighborhood holding a large knife.

Selma officers say the suspect began stabbing himself as officers tried to talk him down. Eventually an officer climbed to the roof on a ladder and fired a taser at the suspect. Investigators say as the officer approached the suspect tried to attack the officer and multiple officers fired their weapons. The suspect was hit by at least one of the shots and died. No officers were injured.

The woman who was stabbed was rushed to the hospital and is in stable condition.

Selma Police Chief Greg Garner says investigators with the Fresno County Sheriff’s Office will now handle the officer involved shooting.
