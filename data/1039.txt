PHOENIX (AP) — The family of a mentally ill man shot and killed by Mesa police Monday said the state's health system is partially to blame.

Raymundo Espinoza, 52, was fatally shot during a confrontation at a group home for the mentally and physically disabled in Mesa.

He was shot because he was threatening people, including four police officers, with a butcher knife and refused to give up the knife, police said.

Espinoza, who suffers from mental retardation, schizophrenia and epilepsy, was moved away from a secure state psychiatric facility two weeks before the shooting.

His family said they didn't want him discharged, but the state Department of Economic Security's Division of Developmental Disabilities was under pressure to consider discharging him and several other patients from psychiatric hospitals.

The pressure came after an advocacy group threatened legal action arguing that hospitalization was too restrictive for some mental patients.

An increasing number of developmentally disabled people are living in hospitals because they have no alternatives, according to officials at the Division of Developmental Disabilities.

Ric Zaharia, assistant director of the division, said hospitals are overburdened because of state mental health agencies' unwillingness to take on more difficult cases and of the low number of available group homes.

Espinoza's family, however, believed he needed to be in the hospital to have someone to care for him around the clock.
