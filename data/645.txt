The two men fatally shot by an off-duty detective while they tried to rob a Brooklyn bodega on Sunday both had histories of robbery arrests, the police said yesterday.

The police and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said it appeared that the detective, Michael Zeller, 36, acted appropriately when he fired his 9-millimeter service handgun at the two men, Jonathan Lynch and James Culberson. One had a gun and the other a knife.

Mr. Lynch, 32, who was on parole for robbery, was shot once in the chest and pronounced dead at the scene, the police said. Mr. Culberson, 25, has been arrested seven times, but details of six of the cases are under court seal. He was hit twice in the chest and taken to Woodhull Medical and Mental Health Center, where he was pronounced dead at 7 p.m., about 45 minutes after the shooting.

A loaded .22-caliber revolver and a folding knife were recovered from the scene, the police said.

Yesterday, the police were able to give a fuller picture of the sequence of events that disrupted the Christmas Eve quiet in the historic district of the Greenpoint section, leaving two would-be robbers dead and the detective's family badly shaken.
