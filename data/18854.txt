"I want to know why he did what he did," a tearful John Thomas Dash told Orangeburg County Chief Magistrate Willie B. Robinson Friday afternoon at a bond hearing for Randy R. Clark.

His daughter's death "don't make no sense," Dash said. "If you hit a dog, you'd take it to a doctor." He broke down in tears, then composed himself. "It don't make no sense at all. It's just not right at all," he said before losing his composure again.

Clark, an Orangeburg County sheriff's officer, is charged with leaving the scene of an accident resulting in death in connection with a March 4 incident. That night, Shemeka Lashawn Murdaugh died after being struck by a passing motorist.

Robinson set bond on Clark at $10,000 surety.

As of Friday, Clark was placed on administrative leave from his position as a sergeant with the county sheriff's office, Orangeburg County Sheriff Larry Williams said.

"He's been revoked of all arrest powers and his equipment," Williams said. "He's not, at this time, in any way associated with the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office."

Investigators say the 19-year law enforcement veteran was off-duty and driving a 1993 Lincoln along Whittaker Parkway at about 10 p.m. that night when two pedestrians attempted to cross the road.

Murdaugh, 24, was thrown onto the left shoulder of the roadway and pronounced dead at the scene, said Lance Cpl. Dwight Green, spokesman for the S.C. Highway Patrol.

Clark later returned to the area and said he might have struck something, Green said.

Clark told investigators he thought the hood of his car might have malfunctioned, causing the hood to strike his windshield. He added that he stopped to check his car after the impact but did not see anything or anyone he may have struck.

Members of the South Carolina Highway Patrol MAIT team went to the Whittaker Parkway scene this week to investigate Murdaugh's death, and a warrant was sought Friday.

"Clark did strike with his vehicle a pedestrian, Shemeka Lashawn Murdaugh, who incurred fatal injuries from the collision," his arrest warrant states. "Clark did then leave the scene of the collision without rendering reasonable assistance for medical treatment for … Murdaugh."

Williams said he was satisfied with the investigation. "Some wanted to hurry it up, but I wanted it to be thorough," he said. "And that's what we have."

About 40 people attended the bond hearing in the courtroom at the Orangeburg-Calhoun Law Enforcement Complex.

Clark softly replied, "Yes, sir," several times as Robinson asked Clark if he understood the charge against him, the reason for the hearing, his right to have a preliminary hearing and so forth.

Robinson asked if a spokesperson for Murdaugh's family wanted to address the court, and Dash came forward.

But the chief Orangeburg magistrate reminded family members the purpose of the hearing was not to assess Clark's guilt or innocence but to determine whether Clark was a flight risk or a danger to the community.

Tommy Scott, representing the 1st Circuit solicitor's office, said the state had no reason to believe Clark would not show up for his trial.

Clark's lawyer, Orangeburg attorney Gerald Davis, told the court there was "no evidence of any alcohol or drugs" being involved in the fatal wreck. Davis said his client has been in law enforcement over the past two decades.

That career as a sheriff's deputy was only about a year and a half old before Clark was involved in two other deaths.

In December 1988, Clark was involved in two fatal shootings during drug raids under former Sheriff C.R. Smith's administration.

On Dec. 7, 1988, a shooting incident in which Clark was involved resulted in the death of Carey A. Moses, 23, a South Carolina State University student.

Then, on Dec. 22 of that year, Clark fatally shot 20-year-old Todd Turner, of Pompano Beach, Fla.

In each of the incidents, the officer was engaged in a struggle that resulted in a fight for control of Clark's service weapon.

The cases were later taken before a grand jury, which did not find sufficient evidence to indict Clark in either of the cases.

After being exonerated, Clark's career had remained unblemished, Williams said.

"He's been an exemplary officer, although Randy did not use the best of judgment in this incident," Williams said. "He's been a good officer."

Williams said Clark's status with the sheriff's office  whether he will be terminated or remain on leave  will be determined Monday after a meeting with OCSO internal affairs.

"If you cross the line, I'll deal with you," Williams said. "That hasn't changed with Randy Clark."

Williams and other officers are also scheduled to meet with Murdaugh's family.

"Our chaplains have gone out to visit with them and offer our support," Williams said.

Robinson ordered Clark to appear for General Sessions Court roll call on May 16. He was told to have no contact with the victim's family before the case is concluded.
