A man who apparently stabbed himself before driving into an SUV in Philadelphia, killing three people, has been arraigned from his hospital bed on homicide charges.

Bail was set at $1.75 million for 29-year-old Keith Campbell after Monday's arraignment.

Campbell, of Bear, Delaware, was allegedly driving erratically on Delaware State Route 4 around 1 a.m. Wednesday, Jan. 2, and failed to stop when officers activated their lights and sirens.

Witnesses told police Campbell crossed the median into oncoming traffic on the 600 block of Packer Avenue while speeding before crashing into the SUV.

Members of the Delaware State Police joined the pursuit but say Campbell's driving became too reckless for authorities to continue following him about five minutes into the pursuit.

Campbell was hospitalized in critical condition with 15-20 stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. Authorities later found a bloody knife with a 10-inch blade inside his vehicle.

Campbell is charged with three counts of vehicular homicide in the deaths of 36-year-old Joseph Ferry, 35-year-old Kelly Wiseley, and 31-year-old Dennis Palandro.

Ferry and Wiseley had become engaged over the holidays.

The SUV's lone survivor was Nicole Palandro, whose husband Dennis was killed in the crash. She is currently listed in critical condition with a broken pelvis.

Campbell also faces one count of aggravated assault and related offenses. No attorney was listed for Campbell in online court documents.

The Newport Police Department was later notified that the vehicle it had pursued was involved in the fatal South Philadelphia crash. The department is assisting Philadelphia police with their investigation.
