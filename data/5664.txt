CLARKRIDGE, Ark. (AP) - Authorities in Baxter County say a 47-year-old man is dead after a standoff with deputies.

Police were called at 3 a.m. Sunday and told a man had a gun. The sheriff's department says seven shots were fired before deputies arrived at the home where the incident was taking place in Clarkridge.

Deputies spent about an hour trying to talk to 47-year-old Robert Killinger, who was outside during the incident. Officials say the standoff ended when Killinger took his own life.

Killinger was armed with a 12-gauge shotgun. There were no reports of other injuries.
