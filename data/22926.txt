MERIDEN — The sentencing of a city teen who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection with a fatal crash on Maple Avenue last August has been pushed back to September.



Rashid Bashir, 18, of Meriden, was initially scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday. He is now to be sentenced on Sept. 7, according to court officials. It wasn’t immediately clear why the sentencing was rescheduled.



In June, Bashir pleaded guilty to second-degree manslaughter, third-degree larceny and evading responsibility. A plea agreement reached in June called for Bashir to serve three years in prison, followed by four years probation. It’s unclear if the plea deal has changed.



On Aug. 19, 2016, police responded to the Maple Avenue area around 2 a.m. for a report of two men looking into vehicles. An officer arrived and saw a Hyundai being driven by Bashir pull onto East Main Street traveling at a high speed, according to Bashir’s arrest warrant. Deshawn Jones, 17, of Meriden, was a passenger in the vehicle.



After a short pursuit by police, the car crashed into several trees in the front yard of 288 Maple Ave. Jones was pronounced dead at the scene.



Bashir fled on foot and turned himself in to police on Aug. 22, 2016. Bashir was originally charged with second-degree manslaughter, third-degree larceny, evading responsibility, driving without a license, reckless driving and traveling unreasonably fast. Bashir has been held on $25,000 bond since his arrest last year.



Public defender John Delbarba represents Bashir, and previously applied for the youthful offender program but withdrew the application because Bashir’s juvenile record made him ineligible.



Officer John Slepski, a 17-year veteran of the Meriden Police Department, was fired after an internal affairs investigation concluded his conduct leading up to the crash violated department policy.
