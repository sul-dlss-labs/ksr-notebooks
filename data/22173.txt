ARCOLA, Ind. (WOWO): The Allen County Coroner has identified the body of a white man found dead inside an Arcola apartment Wednesday afternoon, as 19-year-old Tanner Dennis of Fort Wayne.

An autopsy was completed Thursday and the preliminary findings are that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the chest and the manner of death was ruled as a suicide.

As of right now, the incident is still under investigation by the Allen County Police Department and the Allen County Coronerâ€™s Office.

Officers were originally led to the apartment building in Arcola, in search of a suspect they believe barricaded himself inside the building, after robbing the S&V Liquor Store on Illinois Road, just after 1:00 p.m., Wednesday afternoon.

According to Fort Wayne Pubic Information Officer Mike Joyner, they received a call about a man wearing a grim reaper mask, dressed in a camouflage sweatshirt and blue jeans, going into the liquor store. When Fort Wayne police responded to the scene, a store employee told officers that the suspect left in a red truck, that didn't have a bed.

Police located a similar truck near the apartment building, where the body was found, but no word yet if they were the same person involved in the robbery.
