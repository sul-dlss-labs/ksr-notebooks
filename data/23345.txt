Staff report

Three Levy County sheriff's deputies who shot a man during a domestic disturbance in November have been cleared by a grand jury that found the deputies acted appropriately.

A news release from State Attorney Bill Cervone's office Monday afternoon said Deputy Gary Garboski and Sgt. Kevin Kinik's actions were "within the scope of their training and experience and constituted lawful self defense."

The deputies responded to a domestic disturbance call at 7450 NW 110th St. in Chiefland on Nov. 16, where they were confronted by Michael Wesley Goodale, 34, who was armed with two knives, the release said.

He ignored the officers' orders to drop the knives, even after he was tased by Deputy Robert Canon.

Canon and Garboski both used their tasers, to no effect, and when Goodale charged at Garbosky and Kinik, they shot him. He was taken to UF Health Shands Hospital, but did not survive.

Levy County's spring term grand jury cleared the officers by issuing a "no true bill" finding after hearing the evidence.

The three officers returned to work in December, after being placed on paid leave while the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducted an investigation.

Two deputies sustained minor injuries in the attack.

Levy sheriff's Lt. Scott Tummond said it was the first time since 2005 that deputies there had used deadly force on a criminal suspect.
