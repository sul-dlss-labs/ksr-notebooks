St. Louis, MO (KTRS) A 21-year-old St. Louis County man is charged with second-degree murder after prosecutors say he caused an accident that killed a Swansea Illinois firefighter.

Police say thirty-year-old Brett Korves lost his life on April 4 at the intersection of Page Avenue and Warson Road when Nicolas Washington was fleeing from police and wrecked into Korves. Authorities say Washington was wanted for traffic violations. Washington remains jailed on a $500,000 cash-only bond.

A GoFundMe account is set up for Korvesâ€™ wife and 18-month-old son who is left behind.
