An assault with a deadly weapon suspect was killed after a standoff with police in a South Gate neighborhood Monday.

SOUTH GATE, Calif. (KABC) -- An assault with a deadly weapon suspect was killed after a standoff with police in a South Gate neighborhood Monday night.

The incident started around 9 p.m. in the area of Stanford and Illinois avenues. The suspect, who authorities said assaulted his live-in girlfriend by striking her with a handgun, stayed in his pickup truck and did not want to cooperate with police.

SWAT officers eventually arrived on scene and tried to use less lethal rounds and irritants to get the man out of the car. At one point, he was seen drinking and smoking while he tried to wait out authorities. The irritants that were thrown into his vehicle did not appear to faze him.

Surrounding homes in the neighborhood were evacuated as authorities tried to get the man to surrender peacefully.

Toward the end of the standoff, the suspect opened fire and shot several rounds at officers through his passenger side window.

Authorities then fired back, riddling the vehicle with bullets. The man got out of the vehicle, fell forward and then appeared to be lifeless on the ground.

Five South Gate officers and one Huntington Park officer were involved in the shooting.

The suspect was described by police as a 40-year-old Hispanic man who was a resident of South Gate, but has not been identified.

The investigation was ongoing.
