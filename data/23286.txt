Kentucky State Police say at 6:01 a.m. Post 3 Bowling Green was called to assist the Allen County Sheriff’s Department with a vehicle pursuit, which had originated in Westmoreland, Tennessee.

KSP says the Westmoreland Police Department saw a vehicle "speeding and driving reckless," which led to the pursuit.

Police say upon entering Kentucky, the pursuit led Allen County Deputies through Allen County, crossing into Warren County on KY 101, reaching speeds of over 100 mph.

Kentucky State Police say once the pursuit neared the Smiths Grove city limits in Warren County, Allen County Sheriff’s Department terminated the pursuit, deactivating all emergency equipment.

According to officials, just minutes later, the vehicle was involved in a single vehicle collision on KY 101 near the intersection of US 68-80, and three people were ejected from the vehicle.

Troopers say the vehicle ran off the road and hit a tree.

According to a preliminary investigation, KSP says a total of five occupants of the vehicle were involved in the collision.

Police go on to say that two of the occupants sustained fatal injuries and were pronounced deceased by the Warren County Coroner’s Office, and two other occupants were flown by helicopter to Tennessee hospitals for treatment of injuries.

Police say those two occupants are both currently listed in critical condition, and the other person who was in the vehicle is also now in a Tennessee hospital listed in stable condition.

The names of those involved have not been released, and are pending death notification to family members at this time.

The investigation is still ongoing and being led by Trooper Kevin Mayfield. He was assisted on scene by Medical Center EMS, Warren County Coroner’s Office, Allen County Sheriff’s Department, Smiths Grove Fire Department, and other KSP personnel. No other details are available for release at this time.
