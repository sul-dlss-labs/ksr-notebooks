DENHAM SPRINGS, La. (AP) - A St. Helena Parish man suspected of shoplifting died after Denham Spring police chased him from a Wal-Mart parking lot.

Police say 33-year-old Cedrick J. Addison stopped breathing after officers struggled to handcuff him following a long chase in the heat.

Police Chief Jeff Wesley says state police detectives have been called in and a standard internal affairs investigation has been started to review the Tuesday's arrest. Addison was pronounced dead at the scene by the parish coroner's office.

Wesley says Addison's family told officers he had health problems, including high blood pressure. Also found in Addison's possession were cocaine and pills that are a controlled substance.
