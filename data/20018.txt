SELINSGROVE -- A Snyder County man involved in a state police pursuit at speeds up to 100 mph has died from injuries suffered when his pickup truck struck a tree.

Troopers said they ended the pursuit about a half mile before Jeremiah Michael Herrold, 31, of Port Trevorton, crashed his truck around 2:50 a.m. Saturday along Produce Road in the southern part of the county.

The pursuit began when troopers said they attempted to stop the truck on U.S. Routes 11/15 north of Selinsgrove after observing it speeding in the borough.

The chase continued south on U.S. Routes 11/15, onto Route 35 and Produce Road where they said it ended near Silver Creek Road. Herrold committed numerous traffic violations during the pursuit, they said.

He was taken to Geisinger Medical Center near Danville where he died later in the morning.
