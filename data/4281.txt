CASPER - No criminal charges will be filed against an Evansville police officer who had been pursuing a Casper man who died when his car crashed into a wall, said Natrona County District Attorney Mike Blonigen.

Officer George Mills had backed off the chase before the car driven by Shawn Perovich, 18, hit the concrete retaining wall in Casper, Blonigen said.

The chase began when Mills saw Perovich's car run a red light in Evansville about 2 a.m. June 6.
