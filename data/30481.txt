A 20-year-old man was killed in a one-vehicle crash that police say came after a chase with Texas Tech police and a brief pursuit by a Lubbock officer.

Isaiah Green died early Wednesday at University Medical Center following the crash about 2 a.m. Wednesday in the 4800 block of 4th Street, according to a statement from Lubbock police.

According to LPD, the Texas Tech Police Department was involved in a pursuit with a Saturn Ion shortly before 2 a.m. in the westbound lanes of 4th street.

Tech police discontinued the pursuit based on unsafe speeds. A short time later, the vehicle, which was continuing to travel at a high rate of speed, passed a Lubbock police officer who had just finished an unrelated traffic stop. The LPD officer attempted to catch up to the vehicle, but by the time the officer was able to locate the vehicle, it had crashed in the 4800 block of 4th street.

Upon arrival, the officer located Green, who was taken to UMC by ambulance with life-threatening injuries. Green later died at the hospital.

Through the initial course of the investigation, it appears Green lost control near the intersection of 4th Street and Toledo Avenue, crashing into multiple trees and a brick wall.

The investigation is ongoing.
