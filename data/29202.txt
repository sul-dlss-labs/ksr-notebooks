A man was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted wound following a standoff at a Pasadena auto body shop on Saturday afternoon, authorities said.

The incident began shortly before 1 p.m. when a man called police from the business to report he was armed with a gun and planning to kill himself, according to Pasadena police Lt. Marie Sell.

The man hung up the phone and did not answer attempts to call back, she said. Responding officers encountered family members at the business, who told them the despondent man was on the structureâ€™s second level, Sell said.

Officers summoned reinforcements and attempted to talk with the man, who was in his early-60s, police said.

Officers made their way into the business some time later and found the man suffering from an apparently self-inflicted wound, officials said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

No further details were available.
