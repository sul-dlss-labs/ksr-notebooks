SAN DIEGO (CNS) - A knife-wielding man suspected of domestic violence was shot and killed by San Diego police, authorities said Saturday.

The shooting happened in the 4200 block of Sixth Avenue at about 10:35 p.m. Friday, said San Diego police Lt. Manny Del Toro.

The officers responded to a call of domestic violence in progress in the 500 block of Lewis Street, Del Toro said. The suspect reportedly held a knife to his boyfriend's neck.

The suspect fled the residence and a San Diego police helicopter unit saw the suspect in the 4200 block of Sixth Avenue, he said.

Officers went to that location and found the man, and commanded him to stop, Del Toro said.

"Commands were given to stop and drop the weapon, but the knife-wielding suspect refused to comply. The suspect aggressively advanced towards the officer with the knife. Fearing for his safety and the safety of the public, the San Diego police officer fired his handgun at the suspect striking him in the chest."

A large kitchen knife was found next to the suspect, he said.

The man was taken to a hospital where he died from his wounds, Del Toro said.

"A preliminary investigation revealed the suspect was wanted for a parole violation and he had a violent criminal history," the lieutenant said.
