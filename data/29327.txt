HARRIS COUNTY, Texas — A woman was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound following standoff with SWAT at a Katy-area home Wednesday.

This started when Harris County deputies were attempting to execute a felony warrant on an aggravated assault of a family member charge in the 20400 block of Chapel Glen near Fry Road and Westgreen.

When deputies arrived at the home and made contact with the suspect, she retreated to one of the bedrooms inside the house, deputies said.

The back door was open so deputies entered the home and tried to talk to the suspect. Deputies said they then heard a single gunshot.

The deputies retreated outside the home and called SWAT to the scene. The SWAT team entered the home and found the suspect dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Update to Chapel Glen scene: a deceased female has been discovered inside the residence. Appears to have a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Investigators are enroute to the scene. #HouNews https://t.co/tTzSYse7sC — Ed Gonzalez (@SheriffEd_HCSO) December 16, 2020
