A man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in Glendale on Tuesday morning.

Glendale police said the incident started at 7:00 a.m. near 67th Avenue and Bethany Home Road when they received reports of an armed robbery.

A Hispanic man in his early 20's attempted to take items from a business. A fight started and the suspect pointed his gun at people in the store. The suspect fled the scene but victims were able provide a license plate number.

Phoenix police officers were able to locate the vehicle near 69th Avenue and Clarendon. Officers followed the suspect and Peoria and Glendale police joined the pursuit.

The pursuit came to an end at 43rd Avenue and Northern when the suspect was confronted by Glendale officers.

Officers attempted to take the suspect into custody, but he showed a shotgun and possibly fired a round. Officers attempted to use less lethal means to stop the suspect before he reached for his gun but ultimately had to use lethal force.

The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. He has since been identified as 21-year-old Jorge Alberto Fuentes.

No officers were injured in the incident.
