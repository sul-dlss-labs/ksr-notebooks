As part of a continuing federal narcotics investigation by the D.E.A. and federal prosecutors in the Eastern District in Brooklyn, a team of about eight agents and four New York police investigators had Mr. Dewgard under surveillance yesterday, a federal law enforcement official said.

The agents watched him leave home in the morning and drive to his job and then to another location, where he picked up what the officers believed was three kilograms of cocaine, worth $250,000 on the street. The officers said they turned on their lights and sirens to stop Mr. Dewgard to arrest him, but he rammed his car into theirs and drove off, nearly striking a pedestrian with a child. A few blocks farther, Mr. Dewgard abandoned his Nissan Maxima and ran as an agent chased him.

''One agent caught up with and tackled Dewgard as he attempted to avoid arrest,'' Elizabeth M. Jordan, a spokeswoman for the drug agency, said in a statement last night. ''A violent struggle ensued, during which time the agent's weapon discharged, striking Dewgard.''

Near Mr. Dewgard's body, three kilograms of cocaine were found in a plastic bag, she said.

No further detail was offered on the circumstances in which the agent's gun went off. Officials would not say whether they believed it had been fired accidentally by the agent in self-defense or by the suspect, who may have grabbed the trigger.

''You don't shoot a man in the back for no reason,'' said Mr. Dewgard's cousin, Carla Dewgard, 32, who said he had three young children and had just taken over running the family business, B & A Printing and Graphic, on Flatbush Avenue.
