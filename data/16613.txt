An investigation has been launched into the death of a man after he was apprehended by police inside a Bernalillo Walmart.Bernalillo Police Chief Tom Romero said Ben CdeBaca was involved in a car crash just after 6 p.m. Sunday in a nearby McDonald's parking lot that investigators believe was sparked by a domestic altercation with a woman.Romero said his department started getting calls after CdeBaca, 45, ran into the Walmart after the crash and began fighting with people inside the store. Romero said officers called for backup, because the man wasn't cooperating.The chief said CdeBaca was finally handcuffed and taken outside because he was still struggling with officers.At some point, CdeBaca suddenly became unresponsive, and officers began to perform CPR on him. Romero said the man died.Witnesses describe chaos surrounding man's deathQuestions now surround Bernalillo police and how the man could have died in their custody."He went into electronics, and he threw a TV down or something, and I guess he came back to that area and was throwing drinks around," said Pat Miera, who was inside the store at the time.Miera heard the man screaming, "You guys are going to kill me! You guys are going to kill me!""They started to handcuff him, and they were struggling with him quite a bit," Miera said.Phil Gonzales said he saw the arrest."Police officers were on him, and the man was yelling for help, saying, 'Please help me, please help me,'" Gonzales said.Rio Rancho police take over investigationRomero said he's not taking the situation lightly."This is a very critical, serious event," he said. "We've been in contact with our district attorney and want to know how all of this happened and what the man could have died from."Bernalillo police have since handed over the investigation to Rio Rancho police. Four Bernalillo police officers are on standard paid leave, and they will be interviewed later this week.Police expect more answers after an autopsy.
