A New York City narcotics officer shot his estranged wife, their 3-year-old son and the woman's companion, who died of his injuries, before killing himself Saturday night in Orange County, according to a preliminary report that investigators released yesterday.

The officer, Daniel Drury, 37, shot the victims at a house in Montgomery, N.Y., where his wife and son had been staying since the couple separated several months ago, New York State Police officials said. The dead man, Mark Van Kleeck, 38, had been shot several times, the police said, and died in the house, on Ward Street.

Mr. Drury's wife, Maureen, 36, and their son, Ian, were both shot in the legs, officials said. They were taken by ambulance to St. Luke's Hospital, about 14 miles away in Newburgh. The two were in stable condition yesterday, officials said.

Capt. James McDowell, a state police supervisor in Middletown, said the police believed that Mr. Drury arrived at the house shortly after 7 p.m. and began arguing with his wife almost immediately.
