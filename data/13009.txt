A SWAT sniper fatally shot a gunman who aimed his rifle at law enforcement officers during a standoff at a home northwest of Bemidji, authorities said.

The confrontation unfolded over several hours, ending Wednesday night when Miquell David Deppa, 34, died outside his home in Liberty Township, near Bemidji, according to the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA).

Deppa’s body was taken to the Ramsey County medical examiner’s office for an autopsy.

The Beltrami County Sheriff’s Office received a 911 call at 4:38 p.m. Wednesday from a home in the 9200 block of Spencer Road about a man with mental difficulties, armed with a rifle and threatening to kill himself or officers.

Deputies approached on foot, heard gunshots and saw a man with a rifle run into the home. Soon after, two females ran out of the home to safety.

During the standoff, the man fired several shots toward the officers. He came out about 8:15 p.m. and aimed his rifle at the officers. A county SWAT team sniper fired once and struck the man, sending him crawling back into the home.

Several minutes later, the man broke a window and came out of the residence. Officers took him into custody and emergency medical personnel began treating his injuries.

He was taken by helicopter to Sanford Fargo Medical Center in Fargo, where he was pronounced dead. No officers were injured during the incident.

The sniper who shot the man, Sheriff’s Deputy Jeff Roberts, was placed on standard administrative leave.
