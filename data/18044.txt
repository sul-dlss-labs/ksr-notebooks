One man is dead after a confrontation with Pickaway County deputies early Tuesday morning.

Deputies were called at a home on Five Points Pike in Mount Sterling around 1:20 a.m. after they received a call from a veteran’s suicide online chat service.

When deputies arrived, they encountered Ronald Smith who was outside of the home with a long rifle.

Some sort of confrontation occurred between the deputies and Smith. During this conflict, one of the deputies fired at least one shot at Smith, killing him.

Nearby neighbors said they heard two or three gunshots.

"Negotiators were on the way, but some situations don't allow you enough time to get there," Pickaway County Sheriff Robert Radcliff said.

Sheriff Radcliff explains because his officers were involved in the deadly situation he has asked the Franklin County Sheriff's office to investigate as an external case.

Detectives said Smith’s wife, along with his 10 and 14-year-old children, were in the home.

Neighbor Tom Brigner said he did not hear anything, but he wishes he had been called over to help before the gunfire.

"I would have tried to prevent this," Brigner said. "I could have run over there. I don't know what was going through his mind."

He described Smith as the type of neighbor quick to help anyone.

"All you had to do was ask and Tom would show up. He worked on washers, dryers, air conditioning," Brigner said. "If you had any problems he'd run right over and help you."
