The roommate of a man who Des Plaines police say ran through a neighborhood wielding an ax before an officer shot and killed him early Monday spent the day trying to reconcile those actions with the friend he knew.

Krzysztof Kaczor, 24, of the 400 block of East Washington Street in the northwest suburb, died of multiple gunshot wounds at 2:14 a.m. in Advocate Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, authorities said.

Police were responding to a call of shots fired when a 10-year veteran of the department shot Kaczor as he allegedly came at the officer with the ax about 1:15 a.m., said police Chief Jim Prandini.

"I've known this guy for so many years," said Kaczor's roommate, Krystian, 27, who declined to give his last name. "I don't understand why he would do that. I would never expect that from him."

Police caught up with Kaczor in the 200 block of Oxford Road, about a block and a half away, and one officer ordered Kaczor to drop the ax, Prandini said.

Kaczor "continued toward the officer to strike him," Prandini said. "Fearing for his life, he then shot the person."

"He wielded (the ax) in a threatening manner, and the officer shot him," Prandini said. "You shoot to eliminate the threat. It's a deadly weapon, and the officer met that challenge."

Other officers were in the area but did not open fire, Prandini said.

After the shooting, the officer was put on administrative leave, which relieves him of street duty, Prandini said.

The Illinois State Police Public Integrity Task Force is investigating the shooting, which is normal procedure.
