PAWTUCKET, R.I. (WPRI) â€” While executing an arrest warrant in connection with a Pawtucket murder investigation, police discovered the suspect suffering from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to Pawtucket Police Det. Sgt. Christopher LeFort.

The suspect, later identified as Artur Debarros, 24, was wanted in connection with the shooting death of Julius Bell, 39, outside of a car wash back in October.

LeFort said officers found Debarros inside the bathroom of his Lilac Street home around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday. He was rushed to The Miriam Hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

A 12 News crew on scene saw investigators laying out evidence markers next to what appeared to be shell casings outside the home.

Police have yet to respond to inquiries from 12 News regarding the shell casings.

The incident remains under investigation at this time.
