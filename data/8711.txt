Authorities have identified a 26-year-old man who was fatally shot by two San Antonio police officers last week in the 20th officer-involved shooting this year.

Mauro Segovia of San Antonio is the seventh person killed in officer-involved shootings in 2009.

He was in a stolen Oldsmobile with four youths that officers chased through the West Side on Wednesday night. According to an incident report, officers detained the four teenage boys after a short foot chase.

Police Chief William McManus said Officers Randy Alvarez and Bart Vasquez cornered Segovia in the 1700 block of Waverly Avenue. He told police he had a gun and then reached into his waistband and said he was going to kill the officers, according to a police department news release.

The quintet is suspected in at least one armed robbery on the South Side on Wednesday night, and stolen items were recovered from the Oldsmobile, a report states.

Edward Garcia, 16, and Brigido Avitia Jr., 18, were being held in Bexar County Jail on one count each of aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon and evading arrest. Garcia also faces one count of possession of a prohibited firearm after officers found a sawed-off shotgun in the vehicle.

Two juveniles also were arrested in the incident and are thought to face similar charges, police said.

As is standard in officer-involved shootings, Alvarez and Vasquez have been placed on administrative duty while the shooting team investigates the incident.
