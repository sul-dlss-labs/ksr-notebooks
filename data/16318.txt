John Leonard Berry, a 31-year-old white male, was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies on Monday, July 6, in the 5500 block of Adenmoor Avenue in Lakewood, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

The incident began at 10:40 a.m. when the Sheriff's Department responded to a call about a man who was “acting strangely” and off his medication, according to Lt. Eddie Hernandez of the sheriff’s Homicide Bureau.

The deputies found Berry sitting in the driver's seat of his black BMW, which was parked along the curb in front of his home. When Berry saw the deputy, he allegedly accelerated and drove his car into the front end of the patrol car, according to a department news release.

Other deputies arrived to help restrain Berry, using pepper spray and Tasers, according to the release, but Berry allegedly fought attempts to get him to park and get out of his car.

During the fight, Berry allegedly put his car into reverse, with his door open. A deputy was struck by the door and his legs were trapped between the BMW and a patrol car.

“At that point, fearing for the deputy’s life, the assisting deputies fired at the suspect, striking him in the upper torso,” according to the release.

Berry was pronounced dead at the scene at 10:58 a.m., according to coroner’s records. The deputy, who has not been identified, was treated at the hospital for bruises and swelling and was released.

“I’m not sure how the deputy got out without crushing his legs,” Hernandez told The Times.

Four deputies were involved in the shooting.The department did not say whether the injured deputy was one of the shooters.

Residents in the well-kept neighborhood reported hearing screeching tires and multiple shots.

“We’ve never seen anything like this in this neighborhood,” said Alfredo Gonzalez, who lives one street away from the scene of the incident. “I’m speechless.”
