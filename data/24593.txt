A woman riding in a taxi was killed and three other people were injured when a driver fleeing police caused a crash in Chicago's River North neighborhood Wednesday night, officials said.

Around 10:54 p.m., officers attempted to pull over a white Jeep Grand Cherokee that had been reported stolen and was traveling at a high rate of speed southbound in the 500 block of North State Street and failed to stop before turning right onto Grand Avenue, according to police.

Authorities said the driver of the Jeep then ran a red light at North Dearborn Street, striking a taxi traveling northbound through the intersection in the first block of West Grand Avenue.

A 66-year-old woman who was a passenger inside the taxi was taken to Northwestern Memorial Hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to police. The Cook County Medical Examiner's office could not immediately confirm the fatality and further details, including her identity, were not available.

The driver of the cab, a 64-year-old man, suffered minor injuries and was taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center where he was listed in good condition, officials said.

Two pedestrians on a nearby sidewalk were struck by the taxi after it was hit by the Jeep, according to police.

A 45-year-old man was taken to Stroger Hospital in stable condition with a possible broken leg, authorities said, while a 48-year-old woman was taken to Illinois Masonic Medical Center where she was also listed in stable condition with a possible broken leg.

Three adults inside the Jeep were taken into custody at the scene, according to police. None of the three sustained injuries in the crash, officials said, and it was unclear if charges were pending.

The investigation into the incident remained ongoing.
