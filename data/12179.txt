KANSAS CITY, Mo. — Police have released the identity of a man shot and killed by a Rockhurst University security guard shot following a wreck near campus on Thursday afternoon.

According to Kansas City, Mo., police, Chandler T. Guinn Jr., 23, rear-ended another car near 52nd and Troost. He then got out of his vehicle waving a gun. Witnesses said Guinn started to take his clothes off in the street. He then threatened a doctor who came to the aid of the victim of the crash before he pointed the gun at the security guard, who fired back, hitting Guinn in the chest. He later died at an area hospital.

“I believe the security guard actually heard the accident and started heading this way,” said Darrin Snapp of the Kansas City Missouri Police Department. “Thank goodness he responded so quickly because the way this person was acting, who knows how many people he might have shot.”

The name of the security guard has not been released. There were no other reports of injuries in the incident, which remains under investigation.
