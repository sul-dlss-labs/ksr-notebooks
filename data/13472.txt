A New Brunswick man led police on a high-speed pursuit down Jersey Avenue after a hit-and-run, then crashed his car again, killing an innocent bystander, according to authorities.

Shareef Holder, 28, is charged with aggravated manslaughter, vehicular homicide and eluding police after the Saturday night incident that killed Luis Rodriguez, 22, of Somerset, according to Andrew Carey, the acting Middlesex County prosecutor. Holder is being held on $1 million bail.

According to a statement from Carey's office, the chase started before 10 p.m. in New Brunswick when Holder, driving a 2001 Mercedes ML 320, crashed into a 1985 Nissan Maxima on Route 27 in New Brunswick. The driver of the Maxima was not injured, but Holder fled the scene, police said.

When cops caught up with him on Jersey Avenue, he fled, according to authorities. He continued on Jersey Avenue into North Brunswick. Near the intersection with Huron Road, Holder's Mercedes rear-ended Rodriguez's 1995 Honda Civic, according to authorities. Rodriguez was pronounced dead at the scene. The Civic was badly damaged in the crash.

After hitting Rodriguez's car, Holder's car then hit a GMC Sierra pickup truck and then a Chevrolet Ventura, police said. The two people in the Sierra and the two people in the Ventura were not hurt, according to police.

Police did not say whether Holder was hurt in the crash, which shattered the windshield of his Mercedes.

Anyone with information is asked to call Investigator Crocco or Investigator Morris, both of the Middlesex County Prosecutorâ€™s Office at (732) 745-3300.
