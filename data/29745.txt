SECURITY, Colo. â€” An hourslong standoff in Security ended Thursday, after deputies determined the man inside the home had taken his own life that morning.

Deputies said around 7:30 a.m., they were called to a domestic violence situation on Stingray Lane. About 30 minutes later, a man, who was believed to be armed, locked himself inside the home. Deputies did not believe there was anyone else inside the home.

Deputies were on the scene until Thursday evening, when they determined the man had died by suicide sometime that morning.

Grand Mountain School, which is about a mile from the home, was put on secure perimeter status when the standoff began. That means doors were locked and no students were allowed to go outside. The secure perimeter was lifted around 12:45 p.m.

Four other schools were also briefly put on secure perimeter status, but that was lifted just before 9 a.m.
