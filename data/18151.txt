ST. LOUIS â€¢ The man who was killed Friday night in an exchange of shots with a police officer was identified Tuesday as Michael Thompson Jr., 38, of the 10100 block of Winkler Drive in north St. Louis County.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, in the 900 block of Harlan Avenue in the Baden neighborhood of St. Louis.

Police said the officer, 29, has been on the force for more than five years.

He was placed on administrative leave, which is standard for shootings by officers.

The officer is white; Thompson was black.

Police Chief Sam Dotson said Friday night that Thompson was a felon who was wanted on probation violations.

The incident began about 7:30 p.m. Friday when two officers tried to pull over a Nissan Altima on a traffic matter, police said.

The car continued traveling for two blocks before the driver suddenly stopped in the 800 block of Harlan and fled.

One officer pursued on foot. A probationary officer riding with him held the other two occupants of the Nissan.

Police said Thompson ran up a hill to a house, turned toward the officer and fired at least one shot.

The officer then fired, fatally injuring Thompson.

Police said they recovered a weapon, which had jammed. The officer was not injured.
