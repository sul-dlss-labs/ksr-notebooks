Police received multiple reports Monday that Taylor was randomly firing a weapon both inside and outside the home he shared with his mother.

(WMC-TV) - Bill Stewart watched his 33-year-old neighbor Johnny Taylor die Monday night in a front yard across Parkside Avenue in East Memphis. Flowers and balloons now sit alongside broken glass and blood.

"He came outside, the cops rolled up, he turned around, unloaded on the cops – and they unloaded on him," said Stewart.

Police received multiple reports Monday that Taylor was randomly firing a weapon both inside and outside the home he shared with his mother.

When police arrived on the scene, they saw Taylor crouched down behind a parked vehicle with a handgun. Officers say he did not drop his weapon when asked, but instead, pointed his gun at them and fired several times. One officer returned fire, killing Taylor.

"He got off two or three rounds before the three officers started shooting back," said Stewart.

Stewart said, at one point, he grabbed his own gun in case Taylor came across the street. He described the Taylor as generally sincere and polite, unless he was under the influence.

"Only when he drank ... Of course, yesterday he was drinking," said Stewart.

Police credit Stewart and other neighbors who watched Taylor's violent rant for providing minute-by-minute details via 911.

"That's very crucial – for us to know what's going on before we get here. It's always helpful for us to know what we're walking into," said Memphis public information officer Sgt. Karen Rudolph.

In this case, it was a situation Stewart and others never imagined would end the way it did.

"I figured, you know, worst case scenario he was going to jail," he said.

The officer who fired the fatal shot is relieved of duty pending the outcome of an investigation.
