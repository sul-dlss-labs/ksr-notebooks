The Essex County Prosecutor's office says the county officer, whose name was not released, was approached by an armed, masked man around 11 p.m. Tuesday night.

The two soon exchanged gunfire, and both suffered gunshot wounds. The suspected carjacker, 20-year-old Steven McCrae, was pronounced dead a short time later at a hospital.

Details on the injured officer's condition were not disclosed.

Newark police say a 16-year-old has been arrested in connection with the case and was charged with carjacking and weapons offenses.
