A homeless man is dead after being shot by a Miami-Dade cop Friday afternoon, officials said.

Manuel Bueno, 34, was shot near 169th Street and NE 15th Avenue around 1:30 p.m.

Police were conducting an investigation in the area when Bueno, who was known in the neighborhood as "50 Cent" because that's often how much he asked for, was approached by a cop.

Police claim Bueno had a knife and lunged at the officer, who shot and killed him.

It's unclear if a knife or weapon was found on Bueno.

Residents of the neighborhood said Bueno sometimes lived with his grandmother in the area and that he was generally nice and not a threat to anyone.

Police are still investigating the incident.
