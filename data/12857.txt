OAKLAND (CBS SF) -- A man who was fatally shot by a police officer in East Oakland last week after he allegedly brandished a gun was identified by police Friday as 22-year-old Bernard Peters Jr. of San Francisco.

The shooting happened at about 2 p.m. on May 29 after Oakland police said they received information that some people driving in a car might have a gun.

Officers then spotted the suspected car near 90th Avenue and Plymouth Street and attempted to stop it, but instead the car sped away and officers chased it to 77th and Bancroft avenues, where three suspects got out and ran in different directions.

One officer found one of the three suspects, later identified as Peters, around the corner in the 7700 block of Ritchie Street. Police said

the officer saw that Peters was armed and fired his gun at him.

Peters was injured and was treated by police until paramedics arrived and took him to a local hospital, where he died a short time later.

Investigators found a loaded gun reported stolen out of Georgia that the suspect was allegedly carrying. The other two suspects were found nearby after a brief search and detained, police said.

The shooting is being investigated by the department's major crimes and internal affairs divisions and the Alameda County District

Attorney's office.

Oakland police declined to release any additional information about the incident Friday.
