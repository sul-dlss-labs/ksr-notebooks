TBI agents are investigating the fatal shooting of an armed man by a Carroll County sheriff's deputy on Friday night.

A deputy shot Matthew D. Belk, 27, after Belk got out of his car with a gun in his hand, a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation spokesman said today. No officers were injured in the incident.



The shooting occurred about 8 p.m. on Terry Road near its intersection with McCullough Road, just outside the town of McLemoresville.

Earlier in the evening, Carroll County sheriff's deputies responded to a domestic call at Belk's home, but Belk had left the house prior to the arrival of deputies, the TBI said. Deputies later saw and stopped Belk's car, which matched the description given by the complainant. That's when Belk got out of his car with the gun, the TBI said.



Investigators have not named the deputy who fired the shot that killed Belk.

TBI special agents responded to the scene and are continuing to investigate at the request of 24th District Attorney General Matthew Stowe.

Carroll County Sheriff Andy Dickson could not be reached for comment Saturday.
