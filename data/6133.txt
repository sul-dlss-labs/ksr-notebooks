Andrew MacEarchern, 52, a white man, was shot by a Manhattan Beach police sergeant on the northwest corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue in El Segundo, and died at 7:51 p.m. Thursday, May 10.

According to sheriff's Lt. Larry Lincoln, the sergeant was responding to a call about a man with a knife. When the sergeant met the man on the sidewalk, he had a 6-inch, fixed-blade knife out of its sheath, which he wore on his belt. He advanced toward the sergeant, did not obey commands to drop the knife, and the sergeant shot him. MacEarchern was transported to a hospital and died.
