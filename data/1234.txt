CHICAGO â€” Chicago police are conducting an internal investigation after a woman being questioned in the shooting death of her husband was found hanged in a Calumet District headquarters interrogation room.

Julie Riggs, 44, was found hanged with her undergarments Sunday afternoon, shortly after she told police she accidentally had shot her husband, Edward Riggs, police spokesman Pat Camden said.

The Cook County medical examiner had not ruled whether the death was a suicide, a spokesman said Monday. Julie Riggs was pronounced dead at around 4:30 p.m. Sunday in Roseland Community Hospital.

"We are investigating to see if any department rules were violated and to rule out that there was any negligence," Camden said.

He declined to say how long Julie Riggs had been left alone, saying only that she was being checked on periodically.

Edward Riggs, 52, was found shot in the back of the head Saturday evening in the couple's home in the 6800 block of South St. Lawrence Avenue, Camden said.
