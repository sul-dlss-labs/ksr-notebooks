KENDALL, Fla. â€“ Police said they were forced to shoot a knife-wielding man Tuesday in Kendall.

Frederico Osorio, 20, was identified as the man who was fatally shot by Miami-Dade police inside the Kendallwood Villas at 10511 SW 108th Ave.

Police told Local 10 that Osorio's mother called 911 because he was acting irrationally.

"She was the one advising officers that he was making threats to kill with knives," Miami-Dade police spokeswoman Elena Hernandez said.

When officers arrived, Osorio was armed with knives, Hernandez said.

Officers tried to subdue Osorio with their Taser guns, but when that didn't work, they were forced to shoot him, Hernandez said.
