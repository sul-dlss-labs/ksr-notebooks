Javier Ortiz, a 31-year-old Latino, was fatally shot Friday, Aug. in the 38500 block of Larkin Avenue in Palmdale, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

According to sheriff's officials, authorities were summoned to the scene by a report that a man in the area was "acting violently.” Deputies spoke to members of Ortiz's family, who said he appeared to be under the influence of drugs.

Soon afterward, they were contacted by an off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer, who said he and his fiancée had been assaulted by a man with a pipe whose appearance matched the description of Ortiz, authorities said.

Deputies spotted Ortiz and saw him attempt to scale a wall. After they pulled him down, Ortiz grabbed one deputy’s pistol and pointed it at him, sheriff’s officials said. "The deputy quickly pushed the suspect's hands upward and at that moment the suspect fired at least one shot into the air," according to a statement released by the department.

The deputy pulled his back-up gun and fired multiple rounds at Ortiz, as did a second deputy, according to the statement.

Ortiz’s preliminary coroner report shows he sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head and torso.

One deputy sustained a broken hand during the fight and was treated at a hospital. The off-duty LAPD officer and his fiancée also received medical treatment.

Anyone with additional information about this incident is asked to contact the sheriff’s homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
