MARTINSBURG, W.Va. â€” A Berkeley County, W.Va., man died early Tuesday from a self-inflicted gunshot during a standoff with deputies, according to the Berkeley County Sheriff's Department.

John Patrick Gracy, 50, of Poor House Road was pronounced dead at Berkeley Medical Center, a sheriff's department news release said.

Sheriff's deputies were dispatched initially at 12:16 a.m. to the man's home to investigate a reported domestic situation involving his girlfriend, the release said.

Gracy left the home in a van and passed deputies who were en route to the residence, the sheriff's department said.

Gracy fled in the vehicle when deputies attempted to pull him over, eventually stopping in the 1400 block of the Pitzers Chapel Road, the release said.

Deputies were talking to Gracy and directing him to get out of the vehicle when he retrieved a firearm and shot himself in the head, Berkeley County Sheriff Curtis Keller said.

One deputy fired his weapon after he reported seeing a "projectile" come from the vehicle, but the bullet from the officer's gun struck the van, Keller said.

The deputy didn't see Gracy turn the gun on himself and thought the man was shooting from the vehicle, he said.

Deputies initially were told by Gracy's girlfriend that she fled the residence after he fired a weapon inside the home, the sheriff's department said.

The girlfriend, who met with deputies and provided a statement, told them that her boyfriend was barricaded inside the home, and had several firearms, records said.

The shooting remains under investigation, Keller said.
