TAMPA â€” A suspect seen trying to break into cars fatally shot himself in the head early Wednesday while fleeing from police on foot.

The incident occurred around 4 a.m. on N 52nd Street just south of Busch Boulevard. The suspect, a male, was not immediately identified.

Tampa police gave this account of the incident.

Officers responding to a report about car break-in attempts on Delray Court saw the suspect running through yards and hopping fences.

He met up with a ride-share vehicle on N 52nd Street and drove off, police said. An officer spotted the vehicle soon afterward and activated lights for a traffic stop.

The ride-share vehicle stopped and the suspect fled south on foot along 52nd Street.

The officer chased the suspect on foot and was two houses behind when she heard a pop, police said. She carefully approached and found the suspect on the ground with a bullet wound to the head.

A gun was found under his body. He died at the scene.

Police said he appeared to have died from a self-inflicted wound.
