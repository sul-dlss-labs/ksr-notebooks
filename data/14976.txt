Standoff ends in suicide Published 12:00 am Wednesday, August 27, 2014

A Brewton man shot and killed himself Wednesday as deputies attempted to serve a search warrant at his Shadow Hill home.

Chief Deputy Mike Lambert said Escambia County sheriff’s deputies wanted to question Robert Graves Jr. for theft; however, the day ended tragically when Graves committed suicide.

“We went to the home to serve a warrant for theft of property I,” Lambert said. “When deputies made entry into the home, Graves barricaded himself in his bedroom. Aggressive negotiations were made to get him to exit the home.”

Lambert did not say how long deputies attempted negotiations before Graves shot himself; however, he did say an unidentified female was safely removed the home after deputies made entry.

Graves was laid to rest Monday.
