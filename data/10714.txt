According to Sgt. Greg Sanches, a trooper found 603 pounds of marijuana behind the driver's seat in the sleep room of the cab.

Sanches said the trooper had stopped the truck on a routine commercial truck stop on Highway 59 north near the Angelina River Bridge.

Sanches said the trooper approached the vehicle and attempted to talk to the driver when he heard a gunshot. The trooper took cover and called for backup. When backup arrived, officers approached the vehicle and found the driver leaned over inside the cab dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot.

The truck driver has been identified as Mason Burks, 46, of Missouri. The truck has been transferred to a lab and will be processed. The incident happened around 10 a.m. Wednesday.
