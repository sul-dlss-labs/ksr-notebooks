A man died during a standoff with Jackson police officers at a Jackson residence on Tuesday.

Aerion Brown, 23, from Jackson, was pronounced dead at the scene with a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, according to a press release.

Jackson Police officers began searching for Brown around 7:30 a.m. after Brown's girlfriend told police that Brown assaulted her and another woman with a gun at a Lincoln Circle residence, according to the release.

Jackson City Court issued warrants for Brown's arrest on two counts of especially aggravated kidnapping, two counts of aggravated assault and one count of theft of property after an investigation. Madison County General Sessions Court also issued Brown's girlfriend an order of protection.

Police responded to a 911 call at the Lincoln Circle residence at around 11:26 p.m. Tuesday, according to the release. An unidentified man came to the door of the residence and told police, "He's got a gun, he's 'gonna' shoot himself," the release states.

Officers saw Brown standing inside the residence through a window and told Brown to come out, according to the release. When Brown did not comply, officers evacuated the apartment and one officer attempted to deploy a taser but was not successful.

Brown then ran out of sight and officers pursued him inside the residence. Officers heard a gunshot and found Brown on the floor with a single gunshot wound to the head, according to the release. Footage from officers' body cameras corroborates officer accounts of Brown's death, the release states.

Officers called for an ambulance immediately, but Brown was unresponsive when it arrived, the release states.

The weapon was later identified as a gun stolen from a residence in Hardeman County.
