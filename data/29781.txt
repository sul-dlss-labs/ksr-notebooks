The pedestrian who was struck and killed on Interstate 41 on Thursday night is believed to have been a retail theft suspect who was fleeing Wauwatosa police officers.

The crash, which shut down southbound lanes of I-41 for more than nine hours beginning at 7 p.m. Thursday, was preceded 20 minutes earlier by a retail theft report from Best Buy, at 2401 N. Mayfair Road, according to Wauwatosa police.

The man killed Thursday has been identified as Kevin Wilke, 35, of Milwaukee, according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office.

Before arriving at the store, officers located a car that matched the description of the vehicle believed tinvolved in the theft. They performed a traffic stop somewhere near the Wauwatosa Police Department, at 1700 N. 116th St., but one of three occupants fled on foot as officers approached the car, according to a news release.

As officers searched for the man, they learned a pedestrian had been struck by a car on I-41 near West North Avenue, in the area where the suspect was last seen running, police said.

“Positive identification of the man who was struck is still pending, but at this time we believe the two incidents are related,” police said.

The Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office is the lead investigative agency into the crash.
