A man brandishing a gun in a stolen vehicle with a potentially kidnapped woman shot himself when approached by police in North Bergen on Tuesday night, according to authorities.

Joshua Nunez, 24, of Jersey City, was stopped at about 7 p.m. on 46th Street and the woman in the passenger seat immediately fled from the vehicle, according to the Hudson County Prosecutor's Office.

Nunez shot himself as an officer approached the vehicle and was pronounced dead at the scene, the prosecutor's office stated.

While the death was not believed to be suspicious, authorities continued to investigate. Anyone with information can contact the Office of the Hudson County Prosecutor at 201-915-1345.
