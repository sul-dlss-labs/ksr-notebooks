WEST SACRAMENTO (CBS13) - A 17-year-old is being charged with murder after a pedestrian was killed during a high-speed chase Tuesday night.

But the teen driver didn't hit the man - an officer did.

The accident happened at West Capitol and Pine streets.

"It's crazy," a resident said. "I just live right here in these apartments right here."

It was a grisly scene. A West Sacramento police officer, rushing to join in the pursuit, slammed into a pedestrian, killing him on impact.

The coroners office has yet to release the name of the victim, but we've learned he was a transient living in West Sacramento. The suspect's name is being withheld because of his age.

West Sacramento police say they were in pursuit of a stolen vehicle Tuesday night when the 17-year-old driver sped off. The teen crashed into a parked car a few miles away and ran.

A neighbor tackled him and a crowd held him down until police rolled up. He's now facing murder charges.

"If they didn't put them on a high-speed chase to begin with, then it would have never happened," resident Nick Monroe said.

Jennifer Mouzis has defended minors in murders cases. She expects a first-degree murder charge even though the teen never came close to the victim.

"If you participate in an act that has a natural and probable consequence of death, then you're going to be liable for the murder of another individual even if that murder is caused by another individual," she said.

While Mouzis thinks the teen could have a tough time avoiding a conviction, there may be a legitimate reason that caused him to speed away.

"Sometimes in the news we see that people are driving really fast because they're taking their friend to the hospital," she said.

But on West Capitol, people think the teen should face stiff penalties.

"He caused the whole situation," WC Johnson said. "I mean, he wouldn't have chased him if he didn't steal the vehicle."
