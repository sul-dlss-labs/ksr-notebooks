PITTSBURG — A 24-year-old man died after jumping into a Contra Costa County canal after a police pursuit here Wednesday evening, authorities said.

Kenyon Thomas, of Pittsburg, either drowned or died from the frigid water, according to authorities. An autopsy report has not yet been made public.

Thomas’ body was discovered Thursday morning, police said.

It all started when a California Highway Patrol officer tried to pull over a car with Thomas and two others on Highway 4, CHP spokesman Officer John Fransen said. Thomas was one of three suspects in the vehicle pursued by the CHP. The car’s other two occupants were arrested, Fransen said.

After driving from police, Thomas and the others attempted to run away, authorities said. After eluding the officers, Thomas apparently jumped into the canal. Police have not commented on exactly where Thomas is believed to have entered the canal, nor where the police chase ended.

Typically, officer-involved deaths, including fatalities related to police chases, are reviewed by the Contra Costa District Attorney as well as a public coroner’s inquest hearing. But in this case, the involved law enforcement agencies determined Thomas’ death was far enough removed from the chase that it was not necessary to invoke this county protocol.

The county’s canal system is protected by barbed-wire fences, security patrols in certain areas, and signs warning that swimming in them can be deadly. Still, on average one to two people typically fall in the water and die each year.
