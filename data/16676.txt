Lobster Fest is coming to Wayland! Extend those lazy days of summer and join in the fun at the fourth annual Lobster Fest on Sunday, Oct. 4 at Sandy Burr Country Club from 5 to 7:30 p.m.

A luscious dinner buffet will include lobster, steak tips, chicken, clam chowder, “make-your-own” sundaes and more.

This highly anticipated event is sponsored by the Friends of the Wayland Council on Aging. Highlights of the evening will include the Live Auction, Wine Toss (includes craft beer), and a new game of chance called the Wine Draw.

Proceeds will be used to fund special equipment and activities at the COA. In the past, the Friends of the Wayland COA has purchased a state-of-the-art audiovisual system, including an 8-foot screen, a media cart equipped with a Smart TV, DVD and Video Graphics Array (VGA) connection for guest speakers and course discussions, and a portable PA system.

Also, funding is used to sponsor the monthly senior cafès and special concerts and speakers. In recent years, the Friends group has paid for rental space when room was unavailable at the Town Building. This added space has allowed the COA to carry on regular programming for our seniors.

This event is open to all and has sold out the past two years, so get your tickets early. Cindy Bryant and Doug Leard come every year because of the sense of community they feel and the chance to support the Council on Aging. Cindy loves that she can have fun at such a nice dinner, and still give support for the programs she thinks are so important for our senior population.

Call 508-358-2990 for tickets, or stop by the Village Bank or the Council on Aging located at the Town Building. Tickets are $60. Purchase a table of eight and receive free raffle tickets. Invite your family, friends and neighbors!
