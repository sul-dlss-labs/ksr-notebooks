NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WTVF) â€” After several hours, a standoff situation in South Nashville has ended after Metro police say they found the suspect dead by an apparent suicide.

BREAKING: @MNPDNashville say they found Michael Lynn Tucker dead inside his motel room.

They breached the room earlier and say he died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Tucker never spoke to negotiators who attempted for hours to bring him in peacefully.@NC5 â€” Levi Ismail (@LeviAIsmail) April 1, 2021

U.S. Marshals, the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and Metro police were involved in the situation at the La Quinta Inn on Sidco Drive. Marshals were attempting to arrest 48-year-old Michael Lynn Tucker, who had been tracked to that location. Tucker was added to the state's most wanted list earlier this week after he was accused of killing three people in Memphis on March 26.

When U.S. Marshals got to the door, someone inside fired at least three shots. Police said officers never fired back, but they did deploy tear gas at some point, but received no response.

Sidco Dr. is shut down beyond Harding Place as @MNPDNashville say one man shot at US Marshals in the area.
