Phoenix police identified the man who was shot and killed by police officers after a chase Thursday afternoon at a northwest Phoenix apartment complex.

Police said two officers shot and killed Robert Hammonds, 68, Thursday afternoon near 19th Avenue and Cactus Road.

Police first attempted to make contact with Hammonds after they noticed the car he was driving had stolen plates, said Officer James Holmes, a Phoenix police spokesman.

When police approached the vehicle, Hammonds and an unidentified second man fled from 27th and Peoria avenues. Police followed the car to the apartment complex where Hammonds and the second man fled on foot, police said.

Police detained the younger second suspect and when pursuing Hammonds, he pointed a handgun at police and police then opened fire, according to Holmes.

Two Phoenix Police officers were involved in the shooting. Their names have not been released. Both the officers are 42-years-old and have 38 years of experience on the force between them, according to Holmes.

No officers were injured in the incident, which remains under investigation.
