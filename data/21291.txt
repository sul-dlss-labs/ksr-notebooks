While hundreds of residents gathered on the east side of Detroit to discuss the city's future, a sad scene unfolded on the west side that reinforced the need for progress.

Detroit police officers fatally shot a 22-year-old man they say opened fire after an attempted carjacking shortly before 7 p.m. on 7 Mile at Burt Road.

The television reports an officer wearing a bulletproof vest was hit during the shootout but not seriously injured.

"The individual fired shots at the officers," Interim Police Chief Ralph Godbee

. "Fortunately, those shots did not take effect. Both officers returned fire, striking the individual one time. He was pronounced dead on the scene by EMS."

Police have not released the name of the young man killed in the shooting, and the department will continue to investigate.
