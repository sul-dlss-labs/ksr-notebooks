NEWTON, N.C. — Timothy Shyler Kincaid, 28, of Conover, died in a motorcycle crash at about 10:45 p.m. Friday night after he led a Newton police officer on a three-and-a-half-mile chase.

A Newton police officer was running radar on N.C. 16 near Burris Road when he saw a red and white Yamaha R6 sport bike speeding past headed south. The officer followed it planning to do a traffic stop, according to the department’s press release.

When Kincaid neared a red traffic light at the intersection of N.C. 16 and Mt. Olive Church Road he slowed before running the light. The officer turned on his lights and siren and kept following the motorcycle.

Kincaid rode past Dale Earnhardt Chevrolet, straight through the intersection of N.C. 16 and Business 16 and onto East P Street Ext westbound.

When the officer got to the three-way junction of East P and St. James Church Road he saw that Kincaid had ridden straight across St. James and crashed in the woods on the other side.

The officer called EMS and the paramedics pronounced Kincaid dead at the scene.

The Yamaha’s tire left a roughly 35-foot long skid mark that stretched across St. James Church Road and off its edge through dry brown oak leaves. Red and white bits of broken plastic were strewn through the woods up to 150 feet from the road.

The Highway Patrol is assisting with the investigation.

Kincaid’s father, Timothy S. Kincaid, was honored Tuesday at a reception commemorating his retirement after 28 years of service as a Superior Court judge.
