Coroner’s officials on Wednesday identified a 27-year-old Paramount man shot and killed by a sheriff’s deputy after he allegedly lunged for the officer’s gun.

Vincent Param was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics shortly after the shooting, which occurred about 7:45 p.m. in the 16600 block of Downey Avenue, said Los Angeles County Coroner’s Assistant Chief Ed Winter.

The deputy was investigating a family disturbance when he got into a struggle with Param, authorities said.

The incident began after Param’s grandfather called 911 and the deputy was sent to a home in the Paramount trailer park. When the deputy arrived, the suspect’s grandfather said Param was acting “crazy,” authorities said.

When the deputy contacted the suspect, the 27-year-old told the deputy, “I’m not going back to jail,” and began fighting, officials said. The struggle lasted several minutes, during which time the suspect hit the deputy on the head and attempted to choke him, according to authorities.

The deputy was forced to open fire when the suspect tried to take the deputy’s gun, officials said.

In addition to the Sheriff’s Department’s internal investigation, an independent investigation is being conducted by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.
