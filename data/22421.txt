A police pursuit ended Friday night with a rollover crash that killed two Griffith residents in unincorporated Calumet Township.

Jean Scziglak, 42, and Jeffrey Scziglak, 51, died of blunt force trauma following the wreck that occurred about 10:30 p.m. at 45th Avenue and Ross Road. The location is between Gary and Griffith boundaries, Lake County Police Chief Marco Kuyachich said.

Jeffrey Scziglak was pronounced dead at the scene. Jean Scziglak was pronounced dead at Methodist Hospitals Northlake Campus in Gary, the coroner's office said.

Kuyachich said Gary police initiated the pursuit, and Lake County police were later called to assist Gary officers when the chase entered unincorporated Calumet Township. Before Lake County police could reach their vehicles, the chase ended when the vehicle rolled over, Kuyachich said.

Kuyachich was unsure why Gary police started the pursuit. Gary police couldn't be reached for comment.

Lake County police are handling the crash investigation.
