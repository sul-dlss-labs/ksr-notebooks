Suspect slain by deputies after 3 shot in robbery Twitter CULLOWHEE ?? Jackson County sheriff??s deputies shot and killed Dewann Christopher McCollum, 32, hours after he allegedly shot and critically wounded three people in the early morning of Nov. 15 while robbing the China Dragon restaurant.



McCollum reportedly went into the restaurant after it had closed and ordered Qi Lin, 26, the restaurant??s owner,



Jie Lin, 32, and Cai Bolin, 24, who were cleaning the kitchen, to lie on the floor. He demanded money and the men complied.



However, at that point McCollum allegedly tried to sexually assault Becky Lin, 23, an employee of the restaurant.



The three men then jumped up and bombarded him with tea canisters. Even after McCollum shot them with a .22-caliber semi-automatic handgun, they continued to fight.



The struggle continued into the parking lot, where Qi Lin collapsed from a wound to the thigh.



At that point, Phil Doolan, 21, heard the gunshots and ran toward the sounds of the screams to reportedly find McCollum searching through Qi Lin??s pockets before chasing Youle Lin, 24, another employee of the restaurant, who was running to get help.



Doolan ran back to his apartment and asked Erin Williams, his roommate, to call 911. The two then returned to the scene of the shooting, where they attended to the victims?? wounds until rescue workers arrived.



Around 10 hours later, deputies tracked McCollum to Moss Apartments on Weyehutta Road, about a mile away from the scene of the crime.



When a tactical unit stormed the apartment, McCollum reportedly jumped out of a closet and began threatening the deputies with a kitchen knife. They responded by fatally shooting him.



McCollum??s family said that police did not have enough evidence for the raid and are questioning whether he robbed the restaurant.

McCollum was also facing an outstanding drug charge in Cumberland County, according to police reports.
