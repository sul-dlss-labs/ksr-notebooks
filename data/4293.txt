NEW ORLEANS (AP) - A man shot two women, then went to a nearby police station and shot two officers, before New Orleans police shot and killed him. The shootings happened in about a ten-minute span Thursday night. It apparently started when the suspect went looking for his estranged girlfriend and their child and couldn't find them. Police Chief Eddie Compass says the rampage began when the man went to the home of the woman's mother, asked her for the woman's whereabouts and, when he didn't get a satisfactory answer, shot her in the head and neck. Compass says she's in critical condition. The gunman also shot the girlfriend's sister multiple times and she's listed as stable. The gunman then traveled to a nearby police station.

Police spokesman, Captain Marlon Defillo, says investigators don't know why he showed up at the Fifth District police station but once there, officers recognized him from a description broadcast of him and his vehicle. As officers approached, investigators say the man pulled a pistol and fired shots and officers returned fire. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene. Sergeant David Carter sustained several gunshots to the face and body. He's in critical condition after undergoing surgery. Officer Jon Steele was shot in the right shoulder and is listed as stable. The identity of the gunman was not immediately released.
