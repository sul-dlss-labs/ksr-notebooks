DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- A man convicted of vehicular homicide, eluding an officer and driving a car without the owner's consent won a partial victory today before the Iowa Court of Appeals, which reversed the eluding conviction but upheld the other charges.

William Joseph Pinegar, 28, was charged after he led a Polk County sheriff's deputy on a chase in January 2004 when the deputy attempted to stop him for speeding.

Court documents said the car Pinegar was driving struck a tree and rolled over on its side. A passenger, Melissa Sayles, was thrown from the car and died. Another passenger, Troy McDaniels was injured.

A jury convicted Pinegar of the three charges in December 2005.

The appeals court reversed the conviction on the eluding charge because it was not proven at Pinegar's trial that the sheriff's deputy, Cass Bollman, was in uniform during the chase, an element that must be proven to find someone guilty of the charge.

'There is no dispute concerning the absence of any direct evidence indicating Bollman was in uniform at the time he attempted to stop Pinegar's vehicle,' the court said. 'Because the evidence was not sufficient to establish all of the essential elements of eluding, we reverse Pinegar's conviction on that count and remand for entry of a judgment of acquittal.'

Bollman said he turned on his patrol car's lights and siren during the chase, court records show.

The court upheld the conviction on homicide by vehicle and said Pinegar may raise the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in a future appeal proceeding.

Iowa Department of Corrections records indicate Pinegar is serving a 30-year prison sentence and is eligible for parole in 2019.
