Noe Escobar Reyes, a 41-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a Pomona police officer on Tuesday, Sept. 22, in the 1900 block of South Towne Avenue in Pomona, authorities said.

Officials with the Los Angeles County Fire Department said firefighters were called to the scene about 5:10 p.m. to help two victims caught in a traffic crash, said fire dispatcher supervisor Bryan Webb.

The collision involved an individual with a gun, and apparently escalated into a standoff with Pomona police. The suspect was pronounced dead at the scene.

One witness said the incident involved a police pursuit between officers and two suspects after their truck collided with another vehicle and then smashed into a wall in front of a house.

At one point, authorities ordered passengers in the truck to “come out with your hands up,” said John Nickoley, who witnessed the incident. Then a shot came from the car and police opened fire on the vehicle, he said.

He said more than a dozen shots were fired.

The traffic victims were rescued, but details on their condition were not available. No officers were injured.
