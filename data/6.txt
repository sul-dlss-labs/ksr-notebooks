YORK â€” A $1 million claim has been filed against the city by the mother of a 19-year-old man who was shot by a police officer during a struggle last January.

Kyle Dillon was fatally shot during a struggle with Officer Jason Bargstadt on Jan. 6.

The claim alleges the negligence by employees of the cities of York and O'Neill caused Dillon's death. The claim is generally viewed as the first move toward a possible lawsuit.

The claim states Bargstadt used unreasonable force during the struggle. It also accuses an O'Neill officer of acting inappropriately when questioning Dillon about a gas theft in O'Neill several hours before the York struggle.

The claim appears to say that the actions of the O'Neill officer upset Dillon and contributed to his later actions, York City Attorney Charles Campbell said.

Dillon's mother, Willa M. Dillon, filed the claim in her capacity as administrator of her son's estate. Neither she nor her attorney was available for comment.

A grand jury ruled in February that Bargstadt's actions were justified in defending his life against Dillon.

Special Prosecutor Sean Brennan has said Dillon walked up to Bardstadt's parked patrol car and held a knife to the officer's neck, demanding his gun.

Dillon persisted after Bargstadt refused and eventually the officer drew his gun, Brennan said. Dillon grabbed the weapon and three shots were fired during the struggle, with two of them hitting Dillon.

Dillon's estate has the option of filing a lawsuit if the city denies the claim or takes on action on it in six months.
