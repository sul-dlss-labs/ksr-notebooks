SAN FRANCISCO, CA- A man shot and killed by police officers in San Francisco's Mission District on Thursday morning has been identified as 45-year-old San Francisco resident Luis Gongora, according to the city medical examiner's office.

Police said Gongora, who was homeless, was wielding a kitchen knife in the 400 block of Shotwell Street between 18th and 19th streets shortly after 10 a.m. A homeless outreach team summoned police, who tried to subdue him by shooting beanbag rounds at him.

But Gongora allegedly got up and charged at police and two officers opened fire, according to police. Gongora was taken to San Francisco General Hospital, where he died from his injuries.
