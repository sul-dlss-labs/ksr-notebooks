WARE – Police in Ware have identified the man killed in an early Saturday morning car crash in Ware as Dean K. Latulippe, Jr., a 26-year-old from Barre.

The Northwestern District Attorney's Office reports that Latulippe failed to stop for a Ware police office while turning from West Street onto Main Street, kicking off a short pursuit that the police officer reportedly terminated when Latulippe accelerated his Honda Civic near Club 12 on South Street, which becomes West Warren Road.

Authorities say the police officer found Latulippe’s vehicle on its roof on West Warren Road near Shady Lane. Latulippe, who police said was traveling at a high rate of speed, was found on a steep embankment about 60 feet away from the Honda Civic he was driving.

The district attorney's office said Latulippe, who was alone in the vehicle, died “from significant injuries.” Ware Police listed his address as 261 Valley Rd., Barre.

In January, Barre police criminally charged Latulippe with lying to police and obstruction of justice following an incident in which his father, Dean Latulippe, Sr., nearly froze to death.

The Jan. 2 incident involved the father wading into a river, apparently under the influence of alcohol, according to police – following an automobile accident that occurred during a snowstorm.

The younger Latulippe, who had walked away and was spotted on foot several hundred feet from the accident, initially told Barre police he knew nothing about the accident involving his father.

Ware police, Massachusetts State Police, Massachusetts State Police assigned to the Northwestern District Attorney's Office, the MSP Collision Analysis and Reconstruction Section, and Ware Fire and Ambulance responded the Sept. 6 incident.

According to the district attorney's office, the crash that claimed the life of the younger Latulippe remains under investigation.
