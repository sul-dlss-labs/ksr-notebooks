The shooting is being investigated as “suicide by cop,” said acting homicide Capt. Jorge Duran.

About 9 p.m. Wednesday, police received a call from a man who said he had a knife and a gun and wanted to kill himself.

Three officers went to the home and found Vongpramai with a knife in the back yard of the home on Westinghouse Street south of Tait Street, police said. They ordered him to put down the weapon, but Vongpramai instead ran to the front of the home where he was again ordered to put down the weapon.

Vongpramai ran towards the back yard again and officers momentarily lost sight of him. As the officers made their way to the rear of the home, Vongpramai reappeared at the side of the house and again was ordered to disarm, police said.

“They tried to calm the male down,” Duran said. “They could see he was agitated.”

Vongpramai raised the knife over his head and moved toward one of the officers, the captain said. The 4-year veteran fired at least three shots and paramedics attended to the wounded man, but Vongpramai was pronounced dead at the home, police said.

The captain said police had received a 911 hang-up call about 6 p.m. at the same address. When officers arrived, they contacted the parents, who claimed that it was a misdial and that they were trying to make an international call. The officers left because they didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.

The second call was made by the son, who lived with his parents, who were not home at the time of the shooting.
