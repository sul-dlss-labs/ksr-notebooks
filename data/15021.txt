The Shasta County coroner identified a man shot and killed by Shasta County sheriff’s deputies as Erik Charles Lebak.



Lebak is the son of retired Redding police captain Chuck Lebak, officers said.



Deputies responded to Lebak’s home at the 28000 block of Fig Tree Lane at about 8 p.m. Thursday night after someone reported the 32-year-old sent them suicidal text messages, Redding Police Sgt. Shawn McGinnis said. Deputies also received reports of gunfire in the area.



When deputies found Lebak, he was armed with a shotgun and a handgun, and fired the shotgun at least twice near the two deputies. The deputies have not been identified.



During the confrontation, one of the deputies reported that they were pinned to the rear of the residence and requested emergency assistance, then returned fire and struck Lebak, according to the release.



A medical crew arrived shortly after the shooting, but Lebak was pronounced dead at the scene. Neither of the deputies was injured.



Lebak’s relationship to retired police captain Chuck Lebak will play no role in the investigation and is not considered a conflict of interest in the Police Department’s investigation of the shooting, McGinnis said. Chuck Lebak was not a witness and he wasn’t at the home at the time of the shooting.



“Of course some of the people here know him and have offered their condolences,” McGinnis said.



Erik Lebak has no criminal record in Shasta County. An autopsy has been scheduled for next week.



The Redding Police Department is leading the investigation with assistance from the Shasta County District Attorney’s Office, the California Highway Patrol and the Shasta County Sheriff’s Office.
