A man and a woman killed in a police-involved shooting Tuesday at an Elkton motel were wanted on serious drug charges and armed with what turned out to be BB guns, Maryland State Police said. A video captured the end of the standoff when police attempted to arrest the suspected heroin dealers when for some reason they came out of the motel room armed with replica handguns. Hours after gunfire erupted outside the New Eastern Inn, state police continue to go over every aspect of the incident. Exclusive video obtained by 11 News shows the moments after police knocked on room on the second-floor of the motel when they attempted to arrest Chelsea Porter and her boyfriend, Brandon Jones, both 25 and from Dover, Delaware. In the video, Jones is seen emerging from the motel room moving toward police on the balcony, raising his hands with what appeared to be a gun, police said. The rest of the video shows him being shot numerous times by police. “It was a lot of shots,” a witness said. The man who shot the video, who does not want his identity revealed, also recorded the moment Porter emerged from the door 10 seconds after her boyfriend is first shot. She was also killed. "Police in Delaware had charges against them for possession of deadly firearms and manufacturing controlled dangerous substances," state police spokesman Greg Shipley said. Delaware State Police said they seized more than 2,000 bags of heroin and stolen guns from Jones’ home last week. Late Tuesday while examining the shooting scene, police discovered both weapons were actually BB guns. Regardless, the witness said the shootout appeared real. “The cops nowadays, they get bad rep about shooting people,” the witness said. “In this situation, they did what they needed to do to defend themselves. The guy was first with his weapon, first to shoot." The Route 40 corridor of northern Maryland is known for drug trafficking. State police said they have been working with local departments on a crackdown of the problem. A portion of Route 40 was closed for several hours during and after the incident.State police said that at least one trooper fired his weapon. He is on administrative leave. State police said that they plan on turning over their findings to the Cecil County State’s Attorney’s Office. Officials identify trooper, officers who fired in shooting Maryland State Police investigators determined a state trooper, sheriff’s deputies and municipal police officers fired during incident. Investigators have learned that when authorities knocked and announced their presence at the hotel room when Jones pulled back the curtain, pointed a gun at them and said he had a gun. The police officers retreated from the door and continued to order the suspects to surrender, until they came out and pointed the guns at police. The Maryland State Police identified the trooper who fired as Sgt. Michael Bonczewski, a 10-year veteran of MSP who works on the Maryland State Apprehension Team. The team tracks and arrests criminal fugitives throughout the state. He has been placed on routine administrative leave, which is procedure in police-involved shootings. Maryland State Police investigators have determined three deputies from the Cecil County Sheriff’s Office. The Cecil County Sheriff’s Office identified the three deputies who fired their weapons as Deputy First Class Martin Allen, an 18-year veteran of the Cecil County Sheriff’s Office, Cpl. Jonathan Pristash, an eight-year veteran of the Cecil County Sheriff’s Office, and Cpl. Michael Zack, a 13-year veteran of the Cecil County Sheriff’s Office. The deputies have been placed on routine administrative leave, which is procedure in police involved shootings. Six officers from the Elkton Police Department also fired their weapons. Their identities have not yet been released by that police agency. Authorities said the investigation is continuing. Criminologist: Officers forced to make split-second decisions Dr. Jeffrey Ian Ross, a criminologist at the University of Baltimore, said officers are constantly put in difficult situations to try and determine if a gun is real. "These are split second decisions that need to be made to prevent violence to themselves to others and possibly even the suspects," Ross said. He said the bottom line is officers must use necessary force to try and get the suspects into custody. "Police officers don’t want to be second-guessing themselves when they themselves are shot their colleagues are shot or innocent civilians or passersby or people that are within reach get injured because of their failure to react appropriately," Ross said. Police said that’s exactly what the officers had to deal with in the Elkton shooting. "There is every reason in their mind to believe that they had a real gun," Shipley said. All of the officers involved in the shooting have been placed on routine administrative leave. Both of the suspects were wanted on multiple felony gun and drug offenses.
