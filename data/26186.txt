A domestic incident involving several gunshots turned into a standoff that lasted several hours Tuesday evening in Woodland Park.

According to the Woodland Park Police Department, the shots were fired at a home in the 600 block of N. Pine Street around 6:41 pm.

The arriving officers heard a shot, and when they knocked on the door, they heard a second shot.

A short time later, WPPD issued an emergency notification to surrounding residents, urging them to shelter in place and avoid the area until further notice.

It finally ended just before 11 p.m., when an Emergency Response Team entered the home and found the suspect dead.

Bob Krauss who lives across the street said he knew the suspect. He identified him as Bob Hamm. He also said that this was very out of character.

“He was a very soft-spoken person and retired. Just spoke to him a few days ago and I guess I’m totally surprised,” said Krauss.

It’s still unclear if that person was the only person found inside the home.

Woodland Park PD declined to release additional details, saying this was an ongoing investigation.
