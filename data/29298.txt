Updated at 11:25 a.m. Friday with the name of the person who died.

A 60-year-old man who had been communicating with crisis negotiators walked out of an apartment and fatally shot himself Thursday afternoon, Plano police said.

He has been identified as Charles Michael Catlett of Plano.

The incident began when officers responded to a welfare check near the 6400 block of Ohio Drive earlier in the day.

"Much of the stuff he was saying was very concerning to the call taker who received the call," said Plano Police Department Public Information Officer David Tilley.

An armed person at that location shot at a police vehicle from a balcony, officials said.

"About every 15 seconds the gun went off...three gunshots," said one witness.

Plano police said the officer who was struck suffered minor injuries and was treated at a local hospital. He has since been released from the hospital and is doing well, Plano police said Friday.

Officials did not release any other details on the officer only to say he was a veteran officer in the patrol division.

Police said the Emergency Services Unit was called to the scene as Catlett stayed inside his apartment and ignored requests to come out by Plano Police Crisis Negotiators.

No shots were fired by officers in this incident, police said.

After several hours, Catlett exited his apartment holding a firearm and shot himself around 2 p.m.

Tilley said the investigation is ongoing but this was also likely a case of someone in a deep mental crisis. Tilley said police departments never want these situations to end this way.

"We're dealing with a pandemic, we're dealing with people who have lost their jobs. They're going through stresses they wouldn't normally go through," said Tilley.
