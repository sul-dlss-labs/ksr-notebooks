An officer with The Village Police Department was recently charged in the shooting death of a man holding a bat during a domestic incident this summer.On Friday, KOCO 5 reported that Corp. Chance Avery was charged with first-degree manslaughter after he shot and killed Christopher Poor in July during a domestic incident inside Poor’s home.The Village Police Department officials said they were shocked to learn Avery was criminally charged. Avery was on standby at the home on Downing as a woman gathered her belongings, then things escalated. Body camera video shows that at some point Avery turned around with his weapon drawn as Poor, 49, approached him from behind with a bat in hand.“Put the bat down right now,” Avery said.“I will! I’m glad you’re here,” Poor responded.Avery called for backup as he gave Poor numerous commands to set his weapon down. Those repeated demands were ignored as Poor walked toward Avery.Three shots were then fired.“Headquarters, I have shots fired. I need another unit here,” Avery said.The woman was in distress.“He was not going to hurt you,” she said.“Ma’am, he was coming at me with a bat,” Avery responded.The Oklahoma County District Attorney’s Office filed court documents for first-degree manslaughter against Avery, saying he “willfully, unlawfully and unnecessarily killed Christopher Poor” and that “this level of force utilized by Chance Avery exceeded the level of force appropriate for the victim’s actions during this encounter.”Avery was still on paid administrative leave when charges were filed. The Village Police Department is conducting an internal investigation, and officials said they stand by Avery, who has served in the community for eight years.Avery's attorney released the following statement following the video's release:"Today, the Oklahoma County District Attorneys Office released the body worn camera of Corporal Chance Avery surrounding the officer involved shooting on July 25, 2020 in the City of The Village. "The body worn camera video reflects that Mr. Poor made the decision to advance on Corporal Avery and Melissa Poor while armed with a metal baseball bat. Mr. Poor was given multiple commands to drop the baseball bat. He did not comply. Instead, he angrily confronted Corporal Avery and demanded that Corporal Avery drop his service weapon."Mr. Poor then advanced towards Corporal Avery, while moving the baseball bat from his left hand to his right hand. He then begins moving the barrel of the bat upwards. When Mr. Poor was within 6 feet of Corporal Avery and Melissa Poor, Corporal Avery discharged his weapon in defense of his life and Melissa Poor’s life."
