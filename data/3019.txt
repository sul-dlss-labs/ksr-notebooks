SANTA ANA – A Cerritos man was sentenced today to 17 years to life in prison for the death of two passengers killed when he crashed a stolen car while fleeing Anaheim police in December 2003.

Robert Hurlbut, 26, was convicted in February of two counts of second-degree murder for the deaths of Faye Woolever and Dusty Rhoades of Anaheim, said Deputy District Attorney Howard Gundy. He was also convicted of stealing a car, he added.

The Dec. 16, 2003, car chase lasted about 30 seconds before Hurlbut collided with another auto and hit a tree. Woolever and Rhoades were thrown from the car and killed. Hurlbut, who was seriously injured, tried to run away but was captured.

The three had just purchased drugs, and Hurlbut was high on methamphetamine during the crash, Gundy said.

“It’s another mindless tragedy caused by drugs,” he added.

Kenneth Reed, Hurlbut’s attorney, said his client was remorseful.
