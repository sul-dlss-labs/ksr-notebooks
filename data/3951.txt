A fatal South Side accident received the attention of a U.S. congressman Tuesday and prompted a police investigation to determine whether a police chase was involved.

Chicago police began an internal investigation after receiving conflicting reports from witnesses about the three-car accident late Monday at 63rd Street and Stony Island Avenue that killed Larry Mitchum, 32, of Chicago, said police Sgt. Robert Cargie.

Some witnesses reported a police chase was involved in the accident while others said they saw no squad car near the accident scene, Cargie said.

"At this point, there is nothing that indicates a police pursuit," Cargie said. Two other people involved in the accident were uninjured.

However, Julia Mitchum, Larry Mitchum's mother, said neighbors told her family the accident involved a police chase. She passed the information on to their pastor and U.S. Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.), who has begun to look into the incident.

Rush said he planned to speak with police about the accident Wednesday.

Julia Mitchum said her son was a computer technician for a suburban electronics company. She said he was leaving her house when the accident occurred.
