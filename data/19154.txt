EDWARDSBURG — A 30-year-old Edwardsburg woman was killed in a single-car crash while being pursued by police for three miles in Mason Township Saturday night.

The woman, Amanda Fay Bowers, was pronounced dead at the scene after her car ran off the roadway and rolled in the area of Old Michigan 205 and Redfield Street, according to the Michigan State Police. The crash occurred around 9 p.m.

Authorities said that prior to the pursuit Bowers’ car was stopped with its lights off in a travel lane on a roadway not far from the crash scene. Bowers was alone in the vehicle. When a Cass County Sheriff’s deputy on routine patrol attempted to approach Bowers, she drove around the patrol car and fled. The deputy pursued Bowers in a four-minute chase.

Bowers was not wearing her seatbelt and was ejected from her car.

Police are continuing the investigation into the cause of the crash.
