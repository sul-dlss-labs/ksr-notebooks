A Paden-area man is dead after investigators say he confronted an Okfuskee County Sheriff's deputy with a shotgun early Sunday.

The deputy was responding to a domestic dispute call in the 900 block of South Walnut in Paden at about 3 a.m. Curtis Fipps - who was not involved in the domestic dispute - approached the deputy with a shotgun, according to a news release from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

Fipps refused to drop the shotgun despite repeated orders from the deputy, the release states. The deputy, who was not identified, shot and killed the 48-year-old Fipps.

After the OSBI collects information from witnesses and the crime scene, the district attorney will determine if the shooting is justified.
