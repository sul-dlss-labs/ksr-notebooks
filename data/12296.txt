Updates:



On Jan. 23, Jamar Anderson, a 23-year-old African-American man, was convicted of the double-shooting that left John Person, a 17-year-old African-American male, dead. At about 4 P.M. on Aug. 6, 2008, a woman saw Anderson, who was 18 at the time, committing a burglary in her apartment complex in the 2900 block of Garrison Boulevard and called the police. Anderson said he would come back and kill the woman for what she had done. Around midnight, Anderson came back and shot at her, firing 10 rounds from a semi-automatic gun. He missed the woman but hit her cousin, Person, in the back. Person died on Aug. 17, 2008. Anderson was previously convicted of Person's murder and the attempted murder of the woman on Oct. 14, 2009, but the ruling was overturned on Oct. 6, 2011 because a comment from the judge was believed to have prejudiced the jury.



A second person has been arrested for the murder of Michelle Adrian, a 17-year-old Caucasian female. Tevin Hines, an 18-year-old African-American male, was arrested on Jan. 23. Dorrien Allen, an 18-year-old African-American man, had already been arrested on Jan. 16. Adrian and a 19-year-old Caucasian male were shot while in a truck in 3900 block of West Mulberry Street on Jan. 15. Adrian died; the male survived. Police initially said that the pair were in the block to buy drugs when they were shot. In a press release announcing the arrests of Allen and Hines, police describe the incident as a "robbery that turned violent."
