According to Arkansas State Police, Carter was in a car with a female driver when a trooper initiated a traffic stop on I-40 westbound near Ozark in Franklin County just before 1 p.m. yesterday. As the car pulled off the road, the female jumped from the car and fled into the woods. After the trooper began to chase her, Carter took the car and then sped away on I-40.

Just after 1 p.m., troopers spotted the car on I-40 and a short chase ensued. After the car pulled over, troopers approached, only to find Carter dead at the wheel, the victim of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Troopers were able to arrest Carterâ€™s 36-year-old female companion. She has since been released, and will reportedly face no charges in connection with the incident.
