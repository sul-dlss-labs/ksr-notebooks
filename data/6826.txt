Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 3215 Soway

January 12, 2008 - A suspect who raised a pistol in the direction of Houston police SWAT officers was fatally shot at 3215 Soway about 8:30 p.m. on Sunday (Jan. 11).

The suspect, Stephen Paul Greene (w/m, DOB: 6-3-54), was wounded in the torso and transported to Ben Taub General Hospital where he was pronounced dead.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant C.M. Cegielski and Officer J.T. Barringer reported:

Family members called police when the suspect told them he was suicidal and wanted to kill himself. When the suspect found out police had been called, he told family members he would point a gun at officers to make them shoot him. Officers arrived and met with the suspect’s family outside the residence while other officers set up a perimeter around the house for safety until SWAT officers arrived.

While SWAT officers were in the process of setting up at the scene, the suspect emerged from the front door of the residence with a pistol in his hand. When he raised the gun in the direction of SWAT officers, three officers discharged their weapons, striking the suspect. No officers were hurt.

The three senior police officers who discharged their weapons were M.S. Scales, R.L. Kent and J.D. Coleman. Senior Police Officer Scales was sworn in as an officer in August 1979, Kent in May 1992 and Coleman in January 1982. All are assigned to the Tactical Operations Division.

As is customary in officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney’s Office.
