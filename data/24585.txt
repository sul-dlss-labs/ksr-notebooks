Michigan State Police are investigating a fatal crash caused by a possible intoxicated driver after a Auburn Hills police officer terminated pursuit.

An officer was dispatched at 3:30 a.m. Saturday to a possible intoxicated motorist traveling northbound on Interstate 75 in a Jeep SUV.

The officer attempted to stop the vehicle on I-75 near Baldwin Road but the vehicle did not stop and led police on a short pursuit.

The chase was terminated and the department did not disclose why the officer stopped pursuing the vehicle.

The Jeep continued northbound on I-75, leaving Auburn Hills, and was later involved in a crash on I-75 near Sashabaw Road in Independence Township.

Michigan State Police said the officer was stopped before Sashabaw Road when he observed brake lights from vehicles ahead of him and proceeded to the front where he found the Jeep involved in the crash.

A preliminary investigation revealed the vehicle left the roadway to the right and struck a guardrail. The driver, who was not wearing a seat belt , was partially ejected. The video was captured by the officer's in-car video that was reviewed at the scene.

Anyone who may have witnessed this crash is asked to call the Michigan State Police at (248) 584-5740.
