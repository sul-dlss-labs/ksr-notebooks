A woman shot by a man who opened fire on police officers in Watts and then killed himself, has died at a hospital, police said.

Neither the victim nor the shooter has been identified.

Police called to a house at Grape and 115th streets just before 3 a.m. Friday found a man’s body in a truck. He had apparently been shot to death. Another man began shooting at the officers, who fired back, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

The man retreated inside the house. About two hours later, a SWAT team entered and found the woman critically injured. The man was dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Police said earlier that the woman was his wife but later said they were uncertain of the relationship between the two.

Three children, ages 1, 3 and 8, were in the home during the incident and were unharmed.

Maiya Ray Saucedo, a 27-year-old white female, died Friday, March 8, after being shot in Watts, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Henry Edgar Saucedo, a 33-year-old Latino male, died Friday, March 8, after being shot in Watts, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.
