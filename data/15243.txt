Jose Calzada, 35, called a suicide hotline just after 4 a.m. on Oct. 21, 2014, and spoke with negotiators for more than five hours before saying he was going to bed, according to a lawsuit filed by his family in federal court Tuesday. About two hours after he got off the phone with negotiators, a SWAT team illegally searched his home and property, the suit states, and found him lying in the trunk of his car with a pistol in his mouth.
