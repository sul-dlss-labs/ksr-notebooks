The 23-year-old Joshua Tree woman who was fatally shot by a former boyfriend Monday night has been identified as Ronda Ebeling, San Bernardino County sheriff’s officials said Wednesday, May 23.

Deputies killed the man after they became involved in a subsequent shootout with 58-year-old Ray Wyatt. The Joshua Tree man was also identified Wednesday in a sheriff’s news release.

Dispatchers received a call Monday evening from someone who said they were on the phone with Ebeling, who had gone to meet with Wyatt in a dirt field near the Yucca Trail and La Contenta Road, according to a sheriff’s news release.

The caller told dispatchers Ebeling said Wyatt was acting suicidal, officials said. The caller also said he could hear Wyatt say he had a gun. The caller then said he could hear the woman screaming, the release said.

Deputies found the pair standing outside a vehicle and as deputies tried to speak to them, Wyatt shot the woman in the upper body. In turn, a deputy shot Wyatt, who then ran off, the release said.

Paramedics took the woman to the hospital where she later died, officials said.

Deputies searched for Wyatt and a second deputy-involved shooting took place when he was found, according to the release. Details surrounding the second deputy-involved shooting were not released.

Wyatt died at the scene.
