A man was killed after he stepped in front of a Fairfax County, Virginia, police cruiser late Saturday night, police say.

Jeffrey Ponce Aguilar, 26, of Alexandria, Virginia, stepped into the roadway against the green light at Beulah Street near Old Beulah Street around 11 p.m. Saturday. A police car, driving north on Beulah Street, couldnâ€™t stop in time and hit the man, police said.

"There was no reaction time for the officer based upon the weather conditions and dim lighting," said Fairfax County Chief of Police Edwin C. Roessler at a news conference.

Roessler said there was heavy rain at the time of the crash and Aguilar was wearing dark clothing.

The officer immediately stopped and requested an ambulance, police said. Aguilar was taken to Inova Franconia-Springfield HealthPlex with life-threatening injuries, where he died about 45 minutes later.

The officer, who has not been named, did not require medical attention.

Roessler said the department's crash reconstruction unit will investigate to determine if the crash was preventable. The Fairfax County Police Department Internal Affairs Bureau will also do a separate investigation to learn whether or not the officer complied with procedure.

"At this time we don't have any information if speeding or alcohol was a factor for the driver or the pedestrian," Roessler said. "Unfortunately, accidents do happen and it's a tragic loss of life here with Mr. Aguilar."
