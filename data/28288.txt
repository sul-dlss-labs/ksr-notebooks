Authorities Tuesday identified a carjacking suspect who was killed in a crash that occurred during a police pursuit in the Harvard Park area of Los Angeles.

The car was taken at gunpoint at 11:10 p.m. Sunday at Congress Avenue and 25th Street, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.

A description of the car was broadcast, and a patrol car spotted the vehicle about 20 minutes later at Western and Vernon avenues, where the pursuit began, police said.

The car was going southbound on Normandie Avenue when it collided with a car making a left turn at 60th Street, and each car then hit a parked car, police said.

The female passenger in the carjacked vehicle was pronounced dead at the scene, and the male driver was taken to a hospital in critical condition, according to the LAPD.

The woman was identified Tuesday by the Los Angeles County coroner’s office as 18-year-old Armani Brown. The man’s name has not been released by police, an LAPD spokesperson said.

Two men in the car struck by the carjacked vehicle were hospitalized with stable vital signs.
