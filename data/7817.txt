A high-speed chase that began in south suburban Wilmington ended on a Chicago expressway late last night with the driver crashing and killing himself with a shotgun blast to his head, authorities said.



The episode began as a domestic battery. The man, whose identity was being withheld pending notification of relatives, took his own life on the Stevenson Expressway near the exit ramp to northbound Lake Shore Drive, said Illinois State Police Trooper Mark Hall.The man, in his 20s, was involved in a dispute with his ex-girlfriend in Wilmington before speeding off in her car, a 2008 Pontiac, just after 10 p.m. Monday night, Hall said.



A Braidwood police car spotted the stolen vehicle and unsuccessfully tried to stop it, Hall said, and a chase began. Wilmington police joined the pursuit until the suspect entered Darien, where Darien police took over. They continued the chase to Interstate Highway 55 at Harlem Avenue, when they broke off.



Illinois State Police didn't join in, Hall said, because "it's our policy not to pursue a vehicle in which the subject was involved in a domestic dispute." Hall said the vehicle was last seen at 11:07 p.m., where the pursuit was concluded.



Seven minutes later, State Police received a report of the accident on the Stevenson. There, troopers found in the car a man dead from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. A shotgun was recovered. Hall said investigators were still trying to determine whether the man shot himself before or after the crash. He said the vehicle was found tipping against a retaining wall.



Hall said the pursuit was mainly along the Stevenson, but earlier may have involved side streets. He wouldn't venture a guess on the speeds in the pursuit, but the distance between Wilmington and where the vehicle ended up is about 65 miles.



Wilmington police have not yet commented on the case.
