Prosecutors have cleared three Vancouver police officers who shot and killed an Iraq war veteran after he was acting threatening and roaming the Fruit Valley neighborhood Sept. 7 with a gun.

Nikkolas Lookabill, 22, was shot 13 times by officers after he refused to drop his handgun near the 3000 block of Fruit Valley Road, just north of West Fourth Plain Boulevard. The officers involved were Vancouver police Sgt. John Schultz, 41, and officers Frank Gomez, 32, and Gerardo Gutierrez, 38.

Chief Criminal Deputy Prosecutor Denny Hunter said the shootings were “justified and therefore lawful” in an Oct. 20 letter to Vancouver Police Chief Cliff Cook. They won’t face any criminal charges.

The officers, who were placed on paid administrative leave, a standard procedure following law enforcement-involved shootings, returned to their regular duties on Oct. 25, said Vancouver police spokeswoman Kim Kapp. An internal affairs investigation is ongoing, an official said.

Hunter’s five-page report also reveals that Lookabill had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and was taking the antidepressant citolopram, which has the trade name, Celexa. The night of the shooting, he had consumed several cans of the caffeinated malt liquor, Four Lokos — an alcoholic energy drink, dubbed “blackout in a can,” that has been banned from at least one grocery store chain in Washington.
