INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. (June 2, 2014)— Authorities have identified the 79-year-old man killed in a crash that occurred during a police pursuit Sunday morning.

Police said George Porter’s vehicle was struck after 19-year-old Troy Scott ran a stoplight at 16th Street and Riverside Drive on the city’s near northwest side.

Officers were pursuing Scott after a Marion County Sheriff’s deputy spotted the car he allegedly stole at gunpoint earlier that morning. The officers attempted a traffic stop on the Toyota Camry, but police said Scott fled northbound on Indiana Avenue, where officers later located a discarded .38-caliber handgun on the sidewalk.

Scott proceeded to the intersection of 16th Street and Riverside Drive, where he disregarded a stoplight and struck Porter’s 2000 Honda Accord. Porter’s car then struck a pole, trapping him.

Following the crash, Scott fled the scene on foot. He was later found hiding in trees near South Grove Golf Course.
