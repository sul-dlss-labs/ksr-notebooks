BUTNER, N.C. â€” Two men involved in a weekend shooting outside a Butner restaurant that left a third man dead work at the Federal Correctional Center in Butner, authorities said.

Uriah Metcalf, 30, and Gwynn Basinger, 36, are still employed at the prison, according to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman, who declined further comment Monday.

NO TITLE PROVIDED

Ronald Dewey Anderson Jr., 45, was shot in the parking lot of Taste of Fuji, at 1515 N.C. Highway 56, at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday.

Police said Anderson and Warren Farrell Owen, 44, were inside the restaurant when they got into an argument with Metcalf and Basinger. The fight continued outside, where shots were fired.

"All I know is that I just saw the gunfire, and I wanted them to stop firing," Owen said Monday. "It's just a tragic thing."

No one else was wounded in the shooting, although police said that Anderson also fired at Metcalf.

Owen said investigators asked him not to discuss specific details of the shooting, including what sparked the argument, until Butner police and Granville County prosecutors can determine whether to file criminal charges.

"I just want to see justice done," he said. "I don't think it should have came to this, and I'm just going to let the law run its course and do what they have to do."

Police said they charged Owen with carrying a concealed weapon.

Owen said Anderson once saved a friend's life with CPR and described him as a family man who loved his wife, two daughters and stepson.

"He would never hurt anybody. He was just a great all-around person," he said of Anderson. "It should have never happened, and it happened to one of the most kind human beings I've ever met in my life.

"I wish it had been me instead of him."
