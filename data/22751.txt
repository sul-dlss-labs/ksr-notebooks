A man shot by a police officer last week after he refused to drop a handgun and sword has died, St. Louis County police said Sunday. Authorities say it appears to be a case of “suicide by cop.”

Police identified the man as Joshua Lanflisi, 38, of the 7700 block of Harlan Avenue. He died of his injuries Friday, they said.

Lanflisi had called 911 just after 6:30 a.m. on Oct. 1, drawing officers to the home on Harlan. He did not say why he was calling and he did not answer calls back from dispatchers.

When officers arrived, Lanflisi originally refused to answer the door, then stepped onto the porch holding a handgun in one hand and sword in the other. He ignored commands to drop the weapons, and an officer shot him several times, police said.

Investigators said they found a suicide note written in marker on a bathroom mirror. Police said an autopsy was conducted Saturday.

The home is near the historic Oakland House, southwest of the River Des Peres and northeast of the intersection of Heege and Mackenzie roads.

The officer who shot Lanflisi has been with the police department for eight years, said Sgt. Shawn McGuire, a county police spokesman. The incident is under investigation by the department’s Bureau of Crimes Against Persons. Police said there was a witness to the encounter between Lanflisi and officers. The witness’ version of events matched that of the officer, the department said.
