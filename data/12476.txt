ANNISTON, Alabama --- The

of a Saks couple was a murder-suicide, according to an investigation by the Anniston police.

Sgt. Chris Sparks said Darren Wilson, 52, stabbed Doris Wilson, 50, multiple times at their residence at 4424 Asbury Avenue, killing her. He then used a knife to commit suicide.

On March 10, officers responded at the residence to a domestic violence stabbing call. Upon their arrival, officers learned that a woman inside had been fatally stabbed and were told that the woman's husband had been outside the house with a gun. Those officers then surrounded the house and called for backup.

Negotiators tried to speak to Darren Wilson, but received no answer. Police then used tear gas, but got no response. They also used a robotic camera device to look inside the house.

After forcing their way in, police found Doris Wilson dead in the living room and Darren Wilson's body in the basement.
