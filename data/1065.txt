From Times Staff Reports

A man killed last week by police was identified Monday as a Stanton resident wanted in connection with a home-invasion robbery in which a 61-year-old man was wounded.

Nam Quoc Nguyen, 21, was fatally shot Friday when Garden Grove officers--who were tracking several suspects in the June 7 robbery--ordered him out of a white Honda near Brookhurst Street and Chapman Avenue, and he emerged holding a gun.

Arrested at the scene were two juveniles, since charged with possession of stolen handguns found in the car; and another man wanted in connection with the home-invasion incident. None of their identities have been released.
