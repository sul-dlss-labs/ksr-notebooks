Police Release Video From Fatal West Baltimore Shooting That Left Officer Hurt

Baltimore police on Monday released what body camera video they could recover from a police-involved shooting last month that left a suspect dead.

Police spokesman T.J. Smith said Officers Phillip Lippe and Steven Foster, in their vehicle, trailed 29-year-old suspect Nathaniel Sassafras, who was on foot. Foster stopped the car, the officers got out and, per the video, gunfire erupted almost immediately.

Interim Commissioner Gary Tuggle said the officers, in the West Baltimore neighborhood for a routine crime suppression initiative, had reason to suspect Sassafras in drug trafficking.

The body-worn camera on Lippe was damaged in the shooting such that the video could not be retrieved. The video does not capture the moment Lippe got out of the car, and the audio recording didn't activate until the shootout had already begun. When Foster gets out of the car, Sassafras is seen on the ground, looking up toward Lippe with a handgun in his right hand. Foster drew his gun and rushed behind the car. He radioed for help as more than two dozen shots rang out.

Lippe, who was struck twice in the body armor on his chest and once in the arm, repeatedly maintained he was "good." Both officers yelled at others near the alley.

Sassafras was carrying a handgun with an obliterated serial number and laser sights, Smith said. He fired 10 shots.
