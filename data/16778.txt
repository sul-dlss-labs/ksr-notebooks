HOUSTON (KTRK) -- Houston police fatally shot a man during a standoff north of downtown Houston Friday.

It started as a limited SWAT standoff at a home in the 900 block of Panama Street. Police tried to communicate with the person inside, but were unsuccessful.

Eventually, they heard a gunshot from inside and when police went to inspect, they say the man started firing shots towards the back yard.

Police say the officers later deployed tear gas into the home, which is when the suspect broke out a window, stuck his head out and aimed a weapon at one of the SWAT officers.

Police shot and killed the suspect.

At this point, it's unclear what led to the standoff.
