OKLAHOMA CITY – Officials say an Oklahoma City man died in police custody over the weekend.

On June 9th, police officers were called to the 1800 block of N.W. 10th on reports of a suspicious person.

Police say a man was seen going into a neighbor’s yard and the calling party was concerned he was burglarizing the residence.

When Officer Kelsey Dunn made contact with the suspect, 43-year-old Lorez Chambers, police say he was holding a naked barbie doll and rubbing his genitals through his pants, the police report states.

Police say Chambers appeared to be under the influence of intoxicants.

Officer Dunn was able to get the suspect to stand up and escort him to the patrol vehicle.

However, police say Chambers became uncooperative when the officer attempted to place him in handcuffs.

Two unidentified construction workers saw what was happening and rushed to the scene to assist the officer in placing handcuffs on the suspect.

Officials say Chambers continued to be physically uncooperative and officers were forced to place him in maximal restraints.

When he was transported to the Oklahoma County Jail, it was determined he needed to be taken to a local hospital to receive treatment.

Police say Chambers was admitted to the hospital on June 9th and passed away June 19th under hospital care.

The case is being worked as an in-custody death by the Oklahoma City Police Department.

No other information has been released at this time.
