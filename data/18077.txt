The man who led police on a high speed chase through Twin Falls Tuesday evening, has died. Twin Falls Coroner Gene Turley said Roger "David" Vulgamore, 24 of Buhl, died and most of his organs were harvested for donation.

The corner said the gunshot wound was to his head. His body will be taken to Boise Thursday for autopsy.

The Jerome County Sheriff's Office has taken over investigation of the incident.

A critical task force, headed up by Jerome County sheriff Doug McFall, took over the investigation Tuesday night. This is common practice to have an outside agency look into office involved shootings even if they weren't shot at or firing their weapon.

Details as to why they were chasing the suspect are not being released at this time.

Josh Palmer with the City of Twin Falls said Kimberly Police department originally began a pursuit that would later involve the Sheriff’s office and Twin Falls city police. The pursuit began Tuesday around 5:45 p.m.

Police are not releasing why the suspect was running from authorities.

The vehicle's description is close to that of a car involved in the robbery at KJ’s Gas Station on Blue Lakes in Twin Falls Monday, but Palmer said it’s too early to determine that.

The vehicle was stopped near the intersection of Carriage Lane and Indian Trails in Twin Falls. Palmer said police used the pursuit intervention technique or PIT to end the chase around 6:10 pm.

Palmer said that “at that point the pursuit ended. When they approached the vehicle they found the suspect with a self inflicted gunshot wound.”
