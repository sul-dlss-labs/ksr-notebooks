SNYDER, TX (KCBD) - An investigation is underway in Snyder after an officer-involved shooting left one man dead Saturday.

According to police, it started around 7:45 a.m. when a Scurry County Sheriff's Dispatcher received a call in reference to a male subject threatening to kill himself, his girlfriend and his child in the 500 block of 27th Street in Snyder.

Officers from the Snyder Police Department responded to the scene. Upon arrival on scene the officers observed a male subject standing outside the residence holding a small child and a knife.

The male subject was identified as David Dale Rivera, 52. Police say Rivera retreated back into the residence with the child and he continued to make threats that he was going to kill the child and himself.

While officers tried to communicate with Rivera, they say he continued to make threats to harm the child and he could be seen displaying the knife in a manner that was threatening to the child.

At about 9:35 a.m. Rivera came to the front door and made a comment about which officer to go after. Rivera was standing at the front door and he put the child down just inside the residence. Rivera then came running out of the residence with a knife in each hand straight at an officer. Rivera was shot as he advanced on the officer.

Scurry County EMS arrived and transported Rivera to Cogdell Hospital, here in Snyder where he was pronounced deceased. An autopsy on Rivera is scheduled for Monday November 5th, 2012.

The child was not injured in the incident. The incident is still under investigation.
