SAC CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Officers were justified in shooting an armed man who had killed his son and fired shots at them, Sac County Attorney Earl Hardisty said.

An investigation and autopsy results indicated that Howard Huen, 73, had shot his son, Rodney Huen to death on Sept. 12, Hardisty said. The two men apparently had been arguing when the confrontation escalated into violence.

Police were called by Howard Huen's wife, Nancy, who reported that her son Rodney was assaulting his father. In a second 911 call, she reported that Howard had shot Rodney as he was leaving their home. Rodney Huen's body was found in the driveway when sheriff's deputies and Storm Lake tactical unit officers arrived.

Howard Huen fired shots at officers to keep them away from his home for about three hours.

After setting fire to the house, Huen tried to escape from the back door, but was stopped by gunfire from the officers.

Autopsy results indicated he had been hit twice by bullets from tactical unit weapons. He died after shooting himself in the head, Hardisty said.

"The responding officers were trying to contain an armed individual who had just committed an unjustified homicide, and who was now shooting at the officers," Hardisty said. "The officers acted quickly to remove civilians from danger and probably prevented additional fatalities or injuries."
