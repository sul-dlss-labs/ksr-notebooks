A 20-year-old man was arrested in connection with the death of an innocent bystander killed in a four-vehicle crash after a police pursuit in East Los Angeles, police said.

Jose Fernando Arrellano, 20, was bookedinto the Los Angeles County Jail on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter in the death of Julio Reyes-Salvador, said LAPD Officer Norma Eisenman, a department spokeswoman.

Arrellano was allegedly behind the wheel of an SUV being pursued by LAPD officers when the SUV crashed on Saturday before 1 p.m. in the 5300 block of Poplar Boulevard, officials said.

The crash was triggered when the suspect allegedly tried to flee police during a pursuit in the El Sereno area of Los Angeles, police said.

Officers tried to pull over the suspect, who was driving a silver Chevrolet Suburban, on suspicion of driving recklessly.

The suspect drove away and officers briefly lost sight of him, police said.

At some point the suspect crashed the Suburban into two sedans and a Toyota 4Runner, which overturned at Poplar Boulevard and Huntington Drive.

Reyes-Salvador died at the scene and his passenger was injured.

The suspect and a woman in the other sedan were also injured.

Arrellano allegedly climbed out of the wreckage and began running, but he was chased down and arrested after a police dog bit him, authorities said.

Police said they found a gun in the Suburban the suspect was driving.
