The San Francisco Medical Examiner’s office has released the name of the second victim of a Jan. 1 collision that happened at 21 Street and South Van Ness Avenue, as Silvia Tun Cun.

Last week, donation boxes were set up at Muzio’s Wine Liquor Store where the collision happened, for Tun Cun, 29, and Francisco Gutierrez, 26. One of the victims’ relatives told Mission Local that funds will help the families of the victims send their bodies home for burial. Tun Cun was originally from Guatemala and Gutierrez was from Honduras.

Gutierrez was struck and killed by a white Toyota sedan that crashed into the liquor store at about 7:45 a.m. Jan. 1, after the vehicle was hit by a black four-door car fleeing from police. Tun Cun was a passenger of the Toyota.

A third victim, the 18-year-old man who was driving the Toyota, is in serious condition, according to police.

David Morales, 19, was driving at high speed on South Van Ness Avenue when his vehicle struck the Toyota. The Toyota subsequently hit Gutierrez and smashed into Muzio’s.

Morales shot at three pedestrians near Valencia Gardens at 14th and Guerrero streets earlier that morning before police officers attempted a traffic stop. No one was reported injured in the shooting.

Morales is being charged with two murders, three attempted murders, evading a peace officer, causing bodily harm, participation in a gang, and being a convicted felon in possession of a handgun. He will be arraigned Tuesday Jan. 8.
