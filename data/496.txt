MIAMI, Okla. -- The District Attorney's Office has decided

that a Miami police officer was justified in fatally

shooting a knife-

wielding man Wednesday night.

Assistant District Attorney David Anderson ruled Friday

that Lt. Dan Dorey was justified in the use of deadly force

during a confrontation with Lowell S. Mobley, 49, a Texas

resident who formerly lived in Webb City, Mo.

Anderson said the District Attorney's Office will take

no further action in the matter.

Dorey will be allowed to resume his duties on Monday,

Miami Police Chief Gary Anderson said. He had been placed

on administrative leave pending the outcome of an

investigation.

The police chief said Mobley's vehicle was stopped by

Dorey at 10:26 p.m. after the officer noticed the 1999

Chevrolet pickup being driven in an erratic manner in the

200 block of South Elm Street. Mobley reportedly got out of

the pickup, shouting obscenities, and threatened Dorey and

backup officer Terry Durborow of the Ottawa County

Sheriff's Office, Gary Anderson said.

According to the police chief, other area law

enforcement officials said that Mobley "had a criminal

background and was known to get violent." He said Mobley may

have had an outstanding misdemeanor warrant.
