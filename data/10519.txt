For the Nassau County police, the fatal standoff came a day after three officers wounded a man after he had driven off in a marked police car in Oyster Bay and tried to run them down, the police said. In March, officers from the force shot and killed a knife-wielding 21-year-old man, Anthony DiGeronimo. That episode included the fatal friendly-fire shooting of another Nassau officer by a Metropolitan Transportation Authority officer.

The events that led to Mr. Doerbecker’s death began at the Buoy Bar, about a quarter-mile from the Doerbeckers’ home. According to Lieutenant Smith, officers responding to a 911 call made at 10:23 p.m. regarding a disturbance there learned that a young man dressed in a camouflage shirt had entered the bar a third time after having been kicked out for disturbing patrons.

At 11:55 p.m., the police received another 911 call for a possible burglary on Lynbrook Drive. Allison Donnelly, 42, called the police after confronting an intruder — who was wearing a scarf over his face and holding some sort of weapon — on the first floor of the home she shares with three children and her mother, she said. The police said the intruder was Mr. Doerbecker.

Ms. Donnelly’s house is across the street from the Doerbeckers’. The intruder fled out the front door when she yelled, she said. Officers connected the investigative dots and soon went to the Doerbeckers’, where they tried but failed to have Kurt Doerbecker come out after speaking with him and his father, Lieutenant Smith said.

At that point, police officers took up positions around the house, Lieutenant Smith said. At least 20 officers initially responded, he said. Three of them were on the north side of the home when they saw a man exit through a ground-floor window. One officer was ultimately “forced to fire,” the police said.
