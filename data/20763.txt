A robbery suspect who last Thursday night engaged police in a four-hour standoff committed suicide by tying a bed sheet to a pipe in the ceiling of his hotel room and hanging himself, Dauphin County Coroner Graham Hetrick said Monday morning.

Joseph S. Pavelic, 47, was found dead around 11:30 p.m. inside Room 222 at the Days Inn Harrisburg North on North Front Street.

The cause of death was a “passive hanging.” Hetrick said the forensic term means one is not suspended in the air; rather Pavelic kept his feet on the ground and slumped over to proceed with the hanging.

Police received a tip Pavelic was somewhere along North Front Street and an officer later found his vehicle in the hotel parking lot, which prompted the standoff.

Pavelic at one point broke off communication with the Dauphin County Crisis Response team and they proceeded to tear gas his hotel room, Hetrick said. Police then entered to find Pavelic’s body.

Pavelic, of the Swatara Twp. area, was wanted in connection with two Metro Bank robberies: last Wednesday at the Derry Street, Swatara Twp. branch and a day later at the Jonestown Road, Lower Paxton Twp. branch, according to Susquehanna Twp. Police Chief Rob Martin.

He was also on federal parole for robbery convictions, Martin said.

It was the second time in a month a suspect committed suicide in a police standoff with the Crisis Response Team in Dauphin County. Abel Roman shot himself after a nine-hour standoff with officers at the Hall Manor housing project in Harrisburg on Dec. 18. Roman, 24, of Philadelphia, had been wanted in connection with a shooting in his home city.
