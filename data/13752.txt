Police shot and killed a man who was armed with a rifle and a handgun Monday night at a home in Granada Hills, officials said.

Officers responded about 10:20 p.m. to the 12700 block of Woodley Avenue after police received calls from neighbors reporting shots fired, according to Sgt. Jose Valle of the Los Angeles Police Department.

The incident was initially considered a barricade situation, because the man refused to come out of the house after officers arrived and made contact with him, Valle said.

An officer-involved shooting occurred when man “exited the rear of the residence armed with a rifle,” said LAPD Lt. Brian Gilman.

As a police airship hovered overhead, “the officers did observe the suspect with a handgun” before the shooting, said Sgt. Jerretta Sandoz of the LAPD.

The man was struck by gunfire, taken into custody and pronounced dead, Gilman said.

No officers were injured in the incident.

The identity of the man, who was said to be in his seventies, was not immediately released. He lived alone at the residence, police and neighbors said.
