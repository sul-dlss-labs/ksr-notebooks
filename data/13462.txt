WESTFIELD -- Investigators have identified a man who died of injuries sustained in a Shaker Road car crash Thursday morning following a lengthy police pursuit as 43-year-old Glenn Madison of Chicopee.



Investigators, still probing the crash, have yet to find any obvious or apparent reason why Madison fled police, according to the Hampden District Attorney's office.



According to state police, Madison's 2003 Honda Civic had an expired registration and Madison had a revoked license.



Madison was thrown from his car when it struck a utility pole on Shaker Road.The impact sheered the pole in two and caused the car to roll over.

He was pronounced dead at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield.



State police spokesman Lt. Daniel Richard said the chase involved two separate pursuits. One began in Westfield and involved a state police trooper; the other began in Southwick and ended with the crash in Westfield, involving police from those two communities.



The first pursuit began on East Silver Street at about 7 a.m., Richard said. A state trooper assigned to the Russell barracks attempted to pull over a vehicle for an undisclosed violation, but the car sped away from the scene.



The trooper pursued but the chase was eventually called off by the barracks commander in Russell in the interest of public safety, Richard said.



About 25 minutes later, a Southwick police officer spotted the same vehicle and attempted to stop it, but it again sped off with police in pursuit, he said.



The chase crossed back over into Westfield, with Westfield police joining in pursuit. The crash was reported at about 7:35 a.m., Richard said.



State police were not involved in the pursuit from Southwick back to Westfield, he said.



The accident is being investigated by state police attached to the Hampden District Attorney, state police out of the Russell barracks and the state police collision analysis and reconstruction section.
