Green Bay Police have identified a man who died in their custody as Javier Francisco Garcia-Mendez.

The 46-year-old Green Bay resident was pronounced dead after an April 26 arrest on the city's west side.

Police say the Brown County Communication Center received multiple 911 calls about a man who was pounding on doors and chasing people in the 1400 block of Admiral Court.

A short time later, police were called to the 1400 block of Shirley St for a report of a man who was yelling and screaming that someone was after him.

Officers located the man in the 1400 block of Shirley St. Police said a taser was deployed and the man was handcuffed.

"The officers observed the subject was in distress and began life-saving measures," police say.

The Green Bay Metro Fire Department arrived on scene and continued life-saving measures.

The man, identified as Javier Francisco Garcia-Mendez, was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead a short time later.

Police say he had been arrested the week prior for a disturbance at a different home in the city.

The Appleton Police Department is investigating. State law requires an outside agency to investigate officer-involved deaths.
