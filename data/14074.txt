Officer-involved shooting leaves pedestrian dead at Red Rock Canyon

A man died this afternoon after an officer-involved shooting in the Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area outside Las Vegas.

The shooting happened about noon on State Route 159 at mile marker 11 after a Nevada Highway Patrol trooper and two rangers from the Bureau of Land Management responded to reports of a pedestrian who got into a fight with two bicyclists in the area, Highway Patrol Trooper Jeremie Elliott said.

Another NHP spokesman, Trooper Loy Hixson, said the responding officers reached the pedestrian and a fight ensued between them.

The trooper on the scene signaled over his radio about the struggle, Elliott said. "Several seconds later, he called out, 'Shots fired!'"

During the skirmish, the pedestrian was shot and he died.

Troopers said details still were sketchy as of this evening, but none of the officers were hurt. Investigators still don't know who fired the shots or whether the pedestrian was armed.

State Route 159 remains shut down from roughly the Red Rock Canyon Visitors Center to Sky Vista Drive while investigators canvass the area for evidence.
