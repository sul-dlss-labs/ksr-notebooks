State Attorney General Gurbir S. Grewal said his office was investigating under a law that requires he do so when a suspect dies either in police custody or during an encounter with law enforcement.

Camden County police were pursuing the as-yet-unidentified driver when he crashed his car in an underpass, got out and ran up an embankment onto Route 676, where non-police vehicles struck and killed him near Pine Street around 7:30 p.m. Saturday, Grewal said.

More information will be released as a review of the incident proceeds, he said.
