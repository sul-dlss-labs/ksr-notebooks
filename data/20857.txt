A man who is suspected of stealing a car on Tuesday later crashed during a police chase, setting the stolen car aflame and killing himself, police said.

Derrick Foster, 48, stole a female victim’s car at gunpoint, the victim told the Prince George's County Police Department.

A patrol officer about 10 miles away in Suitland spotted the car, launching a police chase lasting about 30 seconds, police said. Foster turned off the car’s lights to conceal himself from the officer’s view. The officer lost sight of the car.

Foster later crashed into two utility poles in the 4200 block of Silver Hill Road. The car burst into flames.

Officers unsuccessfully tried to rescue Foster by extinguishing the flames and pulling him from the car. He was pronounced dead on the scene.

Police recovered a gun from Foster.
