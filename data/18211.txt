An off-duty court officer who shot and killed a man trying to rob him at gunpoint outside a Queens Dunkin' Donuts was justified in his use of deadly force, officials said Thursday.

Ian Caine, 50, will not face any charges in the September shooting death of Kadeem Trotter, said Queens DA Richard Brown.

Caine was in uniform Sept. 17 for his weekend job as a security guard when the robber approached him near the coffee shop on Liberty Ave. and Merrick Blvd. in Jamaica at about 8:45 p.m., cops said.

As the officer — who had a gun clearly visible in his holster — went to step into his car parked outside the store, Trotter, 24, stepped up to him and whipped out a gun, police said. The robber demanded cash and the officer's handgun, cops said.

In an ensuing struggle, the officer shot the robber in the chest. The would-be thief, was taken to Jamaica Hospital, where he died.

"We have concluded our investigation and informed the Trotter family that we have deemed the shooting justified," said Kevin Ryan, a spokesman for Brown.

Investigators later learned that Trotter's weapon was a BB gun.

Officials said investigators looked at video of Trotter casing the Dunkin' Donuts before Caine walked out.

But Trotter's family has disputed the police version of events, saying Trotter was shot while he was running away, and that he suffered bullet wounds in his buttocks and thigh.

"When someone is shot in the back, absent extraordinary circumstances, it's not a justified shooting," said the family's lawyer, Edward Sivin.

Sivin, has filed a $10 million notice of claim with the state on behalf of the family.
