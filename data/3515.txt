A retired New York police lieutenant was shot to death yesterday afternoon in a quiet beach community on Long Island by a resident who resisted arrest and then fired a shotgun at the officer from a window of his house, the police said. The man then ran over the officer and was fatally shot by the police, they said.

The violence began about 3 p.m. in Oak Beach, after the retired officer, Richard Brooks, 44, who worked part time as a constable for the Town of Babylon, tried to pull over a resident, identified by the police as James Wilson, because he thought Mr. Wilson was intoxicated.

But Mr. Wilson, 40, who was driving a white sport utility vehicle across the Robert Moses Twin Causeway that connects Oak Beach to the mainland, refused to stop, said Lt. Jack Fitzpatrick of the Suffolk County Police Department.

A short car chase ended in Mr. Wilson's driveway at 79 Hawser Drive. Mr. Wilson got out of his car, went into his house, and fired at Constable Brooks with a shotgun from a second-story window, Lieutenant Fitzpatrick said.
