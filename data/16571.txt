Manuel Soriano, a 29-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by a Los Angeles police officer Friday, Aug. 28 in the 14600 block of Valerio Street in Van Nuys, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Shortly after 11:30 p.m., two officers with the LAPD’s Van Nuys Division went to a home after a 911 caller reported a dispute among neighbors, said Sgt. Barry Montgomery. When officers arrived, they contacted the caller, who pointed them to a house next door.

The officers found a 30-year-old man inside the house, Montgomery said, and “shortly thereafter, a physical altercation ensued.”

At one point, Montgomery said, the man grabbed a 4-foot-long metal contractor’s level and started hitting one of the officers in the head and shoulders. Police then shot the man, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

A neighbor told NBC-4 that he believed the man was a squatter who stayed inside the home.

Montgomery said investigators were looking into that possibility but have not yet confirmed why the man was there.Montgomery described the house as “dilapidated.”

“There wasn’t much to look at,” he said.

The two officers were taken to a hospital for minor injuries, Montgomery said, but have since been released.The sergeant said he was not aware of any video of the incident.

The man was the 28th person shot by LAPD officers so far this year. Half were killed.

As with all LAPD shootings, the incident will be reviewed by the district attorney's office, the Police Commission and its independent inspector general.
