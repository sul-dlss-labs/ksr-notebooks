LOS ANGELES, CA — A man who was fatally shot by police while he was allegedly trying to rob four people at gunpoint in the South Los Angeles area was identified Friday.

Kevin Carr, 23, of Compton, died at scene of the shooting that occurred about 9:55 p.m. Wednesday near 111th and Figueroa streets, according to the coroner's office and the Los Angeles Police Department. According to the LAPD, Carr approached the four people as they sat in a vehicle at a gas station and pointed a gun them.

"An LAPD Southeast patrol unit was traveling eastbound on 111th (Street) and saw the suspect and victims," according to a statement from the department. "The officers stopped and gave the suspect commands which he failed to comply with — at which point an officer-involved shooting occurred." A gun was recovered, police said.

Later, at about 2:30 a.m. Thursday, police arrested seven people after they crossed the crime scene tape at the shooting site, the LAPD reported. "A female protester at the scene of the officer-involved-shooting crossed the yellow Los Angeles Police Department crime scene tape and entered the restricted area," an LAPD statement said.

"Officers detained her, at which time six additional suspects crossed the crime scene tape and attempted to free the female from police custody. A struggle ensued between the individuals and the officers. Ultimately, seven people were arrested for willfully resisting and obstructing a police investigation," the LAPD said. One officer suffered a hand injury, police said.
