Shortly before 9 p.m. on Tuesday, troopers responded to a home, located at, 1233 Old Piseco Road, on a call of a man experiencing mental health issues.

One of the troopers who responded, Ryan Mousaw, began speaking with the man, Daniel E. Condon, who was showing signs of instability. Troopers did not immediately say exactly what Condon was doing that made him seem unstable. Mousaw tried to take Condon in to custody to take him to the hospital but Condon began to struggle with him, reports TimesUnion.

Mousaw tried to use his Taser to stun Condon. But troopers said that effort was unsuccessful and Condon struck Mousaw in the head with a hatchet. The blow left Mousaw bleeding. Troopers said Mousaw gave Condon several commands to drop the hatchet, but Condon ignored them and Mousaw shot him. Troopers did not say where Condon was struck or how many rounds Mousaw discharged. Mousaw then tried to give Condon first aide, using an automatic electronic defibrillator but was not able to resuscitate him.

Mousaw was transported to an area hospital where was treated for a head laceration and a sprained right arm and right wrist. He has since been released.
