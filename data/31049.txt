Westwego Police Department officers shot and killed a man who they say reached for a shotgun after a two-hour, slow-speed chase early Saturday morning during which the man threatened to take his own life and declared that police would have to kill him, according to authorities.

Wade Adams, 58, of Westwego, was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting, which occurred in the 400 block of Fourth Street, near police headquarters, said Capt. Eric Orlando, spokesman for the department.

"It's not the outcome that we wanted. Our primary goal was to get this guy to the hospital to get him the help that he needed," Orlando said.

Adams called 911 from the parking lot of an unidentified church in Westwego about 2 a.m. Saturday and told a dispatcher that he was armed with a shotgun and rifle after drinking alcohol and consuming marijuana, according to authorities.
