Incident at 8309 Montridge

August 26, 2006 -- The Houston Police Department is investigating the death of a man at 9:55 p.m. on August 25, 2006.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant M. McStravick and Officer E. Carstens reported:

The deceased, Jose A. Fernandez (w/m DOB 8-4-76), and his common-law girlfriend, had a physical altercation at their residence located at 8309 Montridge. The female left the location and went to a nearby police storefront where she informed a police officer of the assault she sustained from the suspect. She also advised the officer that Fernandez had multiple warrants for aggravated robbery outstanding.

Officers went to the residence and attempted to arrest Fernandez. Fernandez met the officers at the front door, displayed a pistol and retreated to a back bedroom of the residence. Officers heard several gunshots from within that bedroom and then heard some moaning. When officers entered the room, Fernandez was found on the bed with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head. Additionally, other weapons were found nearby Fernandez' person.

Fernandez was transported to Ben Taub General Hospital by H.F.D. where he was

later pronounced dead.

As is customary in incidents wherein a citizen inflicts injury to him or herself in the presence of officers, this incident is under investigation by the Houston Police Department's Homicide Division and the Internal Affairs Division.
