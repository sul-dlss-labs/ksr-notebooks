BANNING — The Riverside County coroner’s office has released the name of a man shot and killed during a confrontation with Banning police officers.

Nolan Hurtzig, 29, was a Banning resident, the coroner’s office said.

The officer-involved shooting occurred about 11:15 p.m. Thursday in the 1500 block of North Blanchard Street, near Theodore Street, according to the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department, whose detectives were asked to handle the investigation.

Sgt. Ben Ramirez said Banning patrol officers were called to a residence to investigate a disturbance and encountered a hostile suspect in front of the property.

“During attempts to detain the male, an officer-involved shooting occurred,” Ramirez said.

The sergeant declined to go into further detail regarding the circumstances, including whether the man was armed.

The suspect now identified as Hurtzig was taken to a trauma center, where he died a short time later.

No officers required medical treatment, according to Ramirez.

Sheriff’s homicide detectives were investigating what happened, he said.
