A 27-year-old Milwaukee man who fatally shot himself after a standoff with Milwaukee police was identified in a Milwaukee County medical examiner's report Monday as Devon M. Arms.

According to police, Arms shot himself in a garage in the 4800 block of N. 24th Place on Saturday morning after a standoff that lasted more than eight hours and during which he fired on officers several times.

Officers began searching for Arms early Saturday after a woman called to report a domestic violence incident and said Arms had a gun, police said.

Arms' death was determined to be a suicide, according to the medical examiner's office.
