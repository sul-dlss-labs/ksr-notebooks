A West Palm Beach police officer was forced to shoot and kill an armed robbery suspect after the suspect fired a gun, according to investigators.Investigators said a person called 911 at 7:06 p.m. to report that he was a victim to an armed robbery/burglary after his bike was stolen.The calling party provided a detailed description of his bicycle, taken at gunpoint by the suspect from his Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard home.Within minutes, a West Palm Beach police officer spotted 39-year-old Anthony Lamar Brown riding the stolen bicycle and ordered him to stop near the 500 block of 15th Street.The suspect refused to stop and yelled expletives at the officer.The officer then drove ahead of Brown and pulled over.When the officer got out of his marked patrol car, a fight arose between Brown and the officer.The officer first tried to control the suspect by deploying his Taser but it did not have any effect on the suspect.Investigators said Brown then pulled a semiautomatic handgun from his waistband and opened fire at the officer. The police officer fell backward as he back-peddled away from the gunfire.The officer returned fire, shooting the suspect."When you put on the uniform, you know the single most difficult situation you may face is what happened in this case,” West Palm Beach Police Chief Bryan Kummerlen said. “But when someone pulls a gun, opens fire and tries to kill an officer, that officer is trained to protect not only himself, but to protect anyone else from being hurt or killed."Brown was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.The suspect’s handgun was recovered at the scene, and two loaded magazines were also recovered from Brown.Police could not release how many shots were fired but the incident remains an active and open investigation.The name and record of the officer involved is expected to be released Monday.The officer received minor injuries in the incident.
