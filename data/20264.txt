Glenda Freese and Steven Miller were set to get married this weekend, according to Metro Police.

But sometime after they called off the wedding, the couple were found on Sunday in their second-floor, central-valley apartment bleeding from stab wounds, police said.

In her final moments, Freese was able to tell officers that Miller had stabbed her, according to his arrest report.

When asked who'd stabbed him, Miller, who was described as being in shock, mumbled, "I did. I did. I did," police said.

Freese died soon after being rushed to University Medical Center, where Miller also was taken, police said.

The man, a longtime Clark County juvenile probation officer, was booked in absentia at the Clark County Detention Center on one count of murder with a deadly weapon, police said.

Officers responded about 11:45 a.m. to the apartment in the 2200 block of West Bonanza Road, near Tonopah Drive, police said. Miller's sister, who'd discovered the scene, called 911.

Upon entering a bedroom, officers found Freese lying next to a bed and suffering from multiple wounds to her chest and arm, police said. As she was losing consciousness, she told officers that Miller had stabbed her. There was a large, bloody butcher knife near her.

Miller was on the other side of the bed with wounds to his neck and hands, police said. He told officers that he'd stabbed himself.

Police said they learned that Freese and Miller, who'd been a probation officer for about 15 years, were supposed to be married soon but that the wedding had been called off.

Miller told a doctor that most of the injuries on his body were self-inflicted, but that one on his hand had happened when his hand "slid on the very big knife," police said. He and his sister declined to further speak to homicide detectives, according to the report.
