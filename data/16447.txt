ST. MARTIN, Mississippi -- A woman died and her son was injured after their vehicle ran off a Jackson County road during a police pursuit.

Deputy Chief Clay Jones told local media outlets that the crash occurred Thursday while the car was fleeing the scene of a fight at a D'Iberville restaurant.

D'Iberville police responded about 5:07 p.m. to a report of a fight involving several people at a restaurant. Jones said officers learned one driver had rammed into a vehicle while leaving the restaurant.

When officers attempted to detain the driver, identified as Marshall Smith of D'Iberville, he drove away and the chase began. It ended when the 2005 Ford 500 left the roadway and hit a tree around 5:14 p.m. between Brittany Avenue and Quave Road in St. Martin.

Jackson County Deputy Coroner Jason Moody said Millicent Sue Smith, 48, of D'Iberville, a passenger in the vehicle and the mother of the driver, died at the scene. An autopsy will be conducted.

Marshall Smith was treated for injuries at Ocean Springs Hospital. He was still hospitalized as of Friday morning, but is expected to recover.

Jones said investigators determined after interviewing witnesses that Marshall Smith stole the vehicle from his mother, who later found it and her son at the restaurant. Jones said that's when the altercation occurred.

Investigators learned Marshall Smith was released from prison on June 18 and on parole for a Harrison County burglary. The Mississippi Probation and Parole Office has issued a probation violation warrant for Marshall Smith.

Jones said the incident remains under investigation.
