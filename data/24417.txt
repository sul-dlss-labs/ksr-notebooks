He was hit by the patrol car, which actually was carrying two sergeants who were on their coffee break at the time, police said. The sergeant driving will be placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigation.

Investigators believe there may have been two other cars that also hit the man but they did not stop. The two vehicles were described as an unknown color sedan and possibly a maroon sport utility vehicle.

The drivers of both of the vehicles that struck the victim will face charges for failure to stop and render aid when identified, police said.

The man who was killed was said to be between 25 and 30 years old. Police did not release his name right away pending notification to next of kin.
