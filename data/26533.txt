A police shooting that left a suspect dead from multiple gunshot wounds late Tuesday morning followed a standoff that started 17 hours earlier when narcotics officers initiated a traffic stop because the man was seen leaving a suspected drug house in Baton Rouge.

Police said the man refused to pull over and then barricaded himself inside a house on Sycamore Street. Hours of negotiations ensued â€” and the suspect fired more than a dozen rounds at officers from inside the building before finally stepping outside late Tuesday morning and pulling the trigger once again.

That's when officers returned fire, Baton Rouge Police Chief Murphy Paul told reporters Tuesday morning. The chief did not release the suspect's name or condition, saying only that he had been taken to the hospital. But an attorney representing the man's family said around noon that he had been pronounced dead.
