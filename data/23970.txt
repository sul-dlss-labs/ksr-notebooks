Lincoln Police said Monday a 62-year-old man in Lincoln committed suicide during a lengthy standoff with police on March 24.

The incident took place in the 4000 Block of Gertie Avenue, causing surrounding roads to be closed for an extended amount of time.

At 5:42 p.m. the Lincoln Police Department was called to the residence on reports of a domestic assault.

Police determined the 62-year-old man had assaulted a 61-year-old female and threatened a 28-year-old female with a knife.

The 28-year-old was holding her 1-year-old child at the time.

A short time later, after the situation had progressed, the 28-year-old female and a 22-year-old male were threatened with a firearm by the armed man.

Lincoln Police said all people involved were part of the same family.

At 10:18 p.m., LPD said multiple gunshots were heard, and one final round was discharged at 11:01 p.m.

Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister said five rounds in total were discharged, none of them were fired by officers.

The LPD SWAT team forced entry into the home at 11:06 p.m. and the male was found in the basement with multiple self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

Police said a handgun was retrieved and is being processed, and an autopsy on the deceased male was performed on Sunday.

Bliemeister said the officers were attempting to negotiate with the male during the lengthy standoff, and that alcohol was a factor in the incident.

Since the death occurred while LPD was attempting to apprehend the male, it is being treated as an in-custody death. A Grand Jury will investigate the incident.

LPD said roughly 40 officers were on scene during the standoff.
