LAKE PANASOFFKEE – A suspected child molester shot himself to death at his home Sunday night as Sumter County sheriff’s deputies were confronting him.

Charles Edward Roberts, of Lake Panasoffkee, died on the scene, according to a sheriff’s spokesman on Tuesday.

According to the Sheriff’s Office, deputies initially were called to a store in Lake Panasoffkee just after 5 p.m. Sunday to reports of a sex offense complaint involving a minor.

The mother told deputies the suspect had molested and raped her daughter repeatedly over time.

As the investigation continued later Sunday at the Sheriff’s Office, Roberts began sending text messages to the victim’s mother indicating he was suicidal.

Standing outside his Lake Panasoffkee home, deputies reached Roberts on the phone and asked him to come out.

About 8:15 p.m. Sunday, deputies heard a gunshot while speaking to the suspect on the phone. They forced their way inside and found Roberts in a bedroom with a gunshot wound to the right side of his head and a .40 caliber gun beside him.
