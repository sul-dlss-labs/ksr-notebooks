A Fort Riley soldier who had been convicted Wednesday of raping a child was killed Thursday after a standoff with law enforcement officers in Abilene, a Fort Riley official said late Thursday.

U.S. marshals and local authorities located Sgt. Kirk Evenson at a hotel in Abilene. He had been reported absent without leave by military authorities Tuesday when he failed to appear for the second day of his court-martial for rape of a child — a violation of Article 120 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

“The man killed by law enforcement officials in Abilene, Kan., this evening was a Fort Riley soldier who was fleeing from military justice,” Lt. Col. Sophie Gainey, 1st Infantry Division public affairs officer, said in a news release.

Evenson was tried in absentia and was convicted and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.

His vehicle was spotted outside a hotel in Abilene on Thursday.

Gainey says Evenson was shot after a lengthy standoff when officers decided to enter the room and he “offered resistance.” Further details weren’t available.

“We are confident law enforcement officials made every effort possible in their attempts to apprehend Evenson peacefully,” Gainey said. “We are saddened for everyone affected by this tragic case.”

Evenson was assigned to the Brigade Special Troops Battalion, 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division.
