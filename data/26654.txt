A deadly police-involved shooting is under investigation in Southwest Miami-Dade.

MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. â€“ A fatal police-involved shooting is under investigation in southwest Miami-Dade County.

According to Miami-Dade police, a man opened fire at officers from inside a unit at the Waterford Point apartment complex.

Police fired back and a standoff ensued.

The standoff ended several hours later when the man, later identified as Richard Cabrera, was found dead.

Police said they do not know whether Cabrera, 38, was shot by officers or if he took his own life.

One officer was grazed by a bullet during the exchange but was treated at the scene.

Police said there was a mother and child inside the apartment during the incident.

Miami-Dade police were initially called to the apartment because of a disturbance.

Once at the door, officers were met by Cabrera's mother, who said her son was under the influence of a drug and was behaving violently.

"He was erratic," Deputy Director Freddy Ramirez said. "While during the conversation, the subject produced a firearm and fired at our officers. Our officers returned fire. At that time, the subject barricaded himself."

Officers retreated and called a special negotiator, but after unsuccessful attempts to communicate with Cabrera, officers entered the apartment and found him dead.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the circumstances of the shooting.
