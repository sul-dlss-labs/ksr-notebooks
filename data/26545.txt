WAKE COUNTY, N.C. (WNCN) – A man is dead after a deputy-involved shooting Saturday night in southern Wake County.

Wake County Sheriff Gerald Baker said deputies received a call around 8 p.m. or 8:30 p.m. in reference to a disturbance on Caddy Road.

When deputies arrived, a man went into the woods and didn’t come back.

Baker said deputies tried to coerce the man to come out.

Deputies left, but eventually came back around 11 p.m. when they got another call the man returned with a weapon.

When deputies returned to the scene, Baker said the man got into his vehicle and locked himself inside.

Deputies tried to get the man to come out of the car and find out what was going on.

According to Baker, the man refused requests and tried moving the car away from the scene.

Baker said deputies used non-lethal force — including pepper spray — to try and get the man out of the car.

“At some point during the ordeal, the subject pointed a handgun towards a deputy,” a news release from Baker said.

Deputies yelled to put it down, but according to Baker, the man pointed the gun at deputies.

Deputies then shot and killed the man.

The man was pronounced dead on scene. His name hasn’t been released. It’s unknown if the man lived in the neighborhood.

“Looking at it, at this point, up to this point, it appears they did everything the way they were trained to do it,” Baker told CBS 17 at the scene early Sunday morning. “They gave this person every opportunity to cooperate.”

While it’s unclear how many shots were fired, Baker said more than one deputy fired shots.

One Wake County deputy was placed on administrative duty, Baker said in the Sunday afternoon news release.

The deputy is not being identified by authorities as of Sunday afternoon.

SBI officials are investigating this shooting.
