CANTON, Ohio (AP) - Canton police say a murder suspect who shot himself while hostage negotiators tried to coax him from a car was agitated by repeated calls to his three cell phones.

Sergeant Frank Love says Leo Knighton would get upset every time he had to talk with a friend or relative who called him during Sunday's standoff in a church parking lot.

Love says Knighton also appeared to feel pressure because he was surrounded by police and being watched by residents of nearby apartments.

Knighton was pronounced dead at a hospital about ten hours after he shot himself in the chest.

A murder warrant had been issued for his arrest in the shooting death of his ex-girlfriend, Bobbie Moore
