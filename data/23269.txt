Phoenix police say an unidentified man was fatally shot by an off-duty officer on Saturday after he stabbed a city bus driver and a passenger.

Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix police spokesman, said in a news release that the man, armed with two knives, boarded a Valley Metro bus near 51st Avenue and Cactus Road.

Police said the man injured the bus driver with the knife and stabbed a passenger. The driver stopped the bus west of the Interstate 17 underpass, and the driver and other passengers fled, police said.

Police said the man then was trying to get away in other motorists' vehicles when an off-duty Phoenix police sergeant saw him.

The sergeant, a 32-year-old man who has worked as an officer for 10 years, got out his handgun, identified himself as police and gave commands to the man, police said. The sergeant was in his personal vehicle and was out of uniform, police said.

Lewis said the man didn't follow the sergeant's commands and walked toward the officer. That was when the officer shot and killed the man, police said.

Responding officers attempted CPR on the man, but he was pronounced dead at the scene, Lewis said.

The stabbing victims were taken to a hospital for treatment of non-life-threatening injuries.

Police didn't release the name of the officer. They said they were waiting to notify the shooting victim's relatives before identifying the officer.
