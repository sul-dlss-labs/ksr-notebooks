The records released responsive to the request were incomplete, but did provide enough data to produce a preliminary numerical and statistical report of officer-involved shootings in Dallas, TX from 2002 through mid-2013. The causes and individual circumstances of each shooting are not reported here, although DCOC has requested and is awaiting a response from Dallas PoUce for each "Use of Force Report" from 2007-2012. We split the findings into two separate parts, where Part I focuses on the ten year overview and Part II elaborates on a year by year basis. DCOC's analysis of the data provides a clear picture of overwhelming bias in the appUcation of deadly force against Black and Hispanic citizens, and makes a valid argument that the Dallas Police use race as a determining factor when making the decision to use deadly force against an individual. While Texas does have a state law that requires local police departments to report racial profiling data on traffic and pedestrian stops, there is no law that has been enforced that requires reporting on officer involved shootings at the municipal level. This report seeks to fill this gap and provide a clear understanding to the public of the interaction between Dallas PoUce and the communities they are tasked with serving. Background: Beginning on September 1, 2001 the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure was amended through House Bill 3389. This state law required law enforcement agencies to begin reporting racial profiling data concerning traffic and pedestrian stops to the Texas Commission on Law Enforcement Standards (TCLEOSE). All agencies must file an annual report with TCLEOSE, as well as their respective governing body, which in the case of the Dallas PoUce Department is the City of Dallas. The Dallas Police Department is considered a Tier 1 Partially Exempt Agency, which means that data collected for the annual report must include the number of motor vehicle stops, the race or ethnicity of the person(s) who were stopped, the number of stops that the race or ethnicity was known prior to the stop, the number of stops in which a search was conducted, and the number of consents to search that were received prior to the search. Senate Bill 1074/HB 3389 as authored by Texas State Senator Royce West does not require that agencies report racial profiling data for officer- involved shootings, or when law enforcement uses force against civilians. Additionally, the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (Assault Weapons Ban) passed under the Clinton administration required that "The Attorney General shall, through appropriate means, acquire data about the use of excessive force by law enforcement officers." In response to 42 U.S.C. 210402, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Institute of Justice issued a report outlining the process for collection of this data which included development of a national database on police use of force based on information voluntarily provided by police departments and a Police-Public Contact Survey issued to individuals who may have experienced use of force through interaction with police. According to BJS, the survey provides detailed information on the characteristics of persons who had some type of contact with pohce during the year, including those who contacted the pohce to report a crime or were pulled over in a traffic stop, or for other reasons. There are of course several issues with the federal reporting of excessive force data. First, it relies on municipal police departments to voluntarily report those numbers. As is apparent by the widespread lack of use of force data nationally, departments have consistently refused to volunteer that information. There is also zero federal enforcement of this law, hence there is no incentive for poUce departments to comply. Secondly, the PoUce-PubUc Contact Survey is supposedly issued to a national sample of persons who had contact with police within the prior twelve months. DCOC has been organizing in the greater Dallas area for upwards of six years and have never come across a victim of poUce brutality who was subject to this survey. Finally, and most importantly, those individuals who were part of an officer involved shooting and were killed are unable to complete any survey, and with families members difficult to locate the numbers are seriously flawed faiUng to accurately represent the reality of excessive and deadly force on the streets of the United States, and most certainly not on the streets of Dallas, TX. According to Dallas PoUce General Order 906.02(D) Authorization to Use Deadly Force; "Officers will only use deadly force to protect themselves or another person imminent death or serious bodily injury". General Order 906.02(E) Drawing or Displaying Firearms requires that a threat or reasonable belief that there is a threat to life or they have reasonable fear for their own safety and/or the safety of others exist in order to authorize an office to draw or display her/his firearm. Other uses of force may include hand locks, arm bars, take- downs, pepper spray, tasers, batons, and police dogs. Based on Dallas Police General Orders, DCOC assumes that any time a weapon is pulled constitutes an act of deadly force, regardless of whether an individual is wounded, killed, or not. Any time an officer-involved shooting occurs and is categorized by the Dallas Police Department as an OIS, regardless of whether the individual was injured or killed, as long as race is identified, the shooting shall be categorized as an officer-involved shooting. Methodology: Open Records Request 2013-09685 was submitted under Texas Open Records Act, Chapter 552 of the Local Government Code via email on August 12, 2013 to the Dallas Police Department Records Division Open Records Unit located at 1400 South Lamar St. Dallas, TX 75215. The invoice date for the records was September 13, 2013, and records were released on October 14, 2013. DCOC specifically requested "information relevant to Officer-Involved Shootings, and/or shooting deaths of civiUans by Dallas Police from January 1, 1987 through August 11, 2013..." Included in the results were Internal Affairs case numbers, date of occurrence, service number, precipitating factor(s), officer assessment of situation, service rendered, sub-classification, name, race, sex of the shooting victim, name, race, sex of officers involved, and allegations of police misconduct if any. For the purposes of determining any pattern or practice of racial profiUng in the application of deadly force during officer involved shootings we used "Sub- Classification", as listed in records provided, as a determinant factor. DPD's "Sub-Classification" describes whether the individual was killed, injured, or not injured. Here, Sub-classification "suspect killed" and "suspect injured" were coded as "Victim Killed (Y/N)", respectively. Race identifiers were implemented using data provided by the Dallas Police, where Black (B), White (W), Hispanic (H), Asian (A), and Other/NA were paired with a numerical ID Code ranging from 1-8. ID Codes 1 through 4 apply specifically to fatal officer involved shootings, where 1 - White (W), 2 - Black (B), 3 - Hispanic (H), and 4 = Black and Hispanic (BH). ID Codes 5 through 8 apply to non-fatal shootings, where 5 = White (W), 6 = Black (B), 7 = Hispanic (H), 8 = Black and Hispanic (BH*), and 9 - Asian (A). Female is coded as (F), and Male is coded as (M). Each set of observations, fatal and non-fatal, were analyzed exclusive of one another to determine rates of officer-involved shootings by race, sex, and date of occurrence. Analysis begins on July 20, 2002 and goes through July 20, 2013. In the Part I Findings DCOC develops a comprehensive overview of a ten years, while in Part II Findings we go into more detail by analyzing available statistics year by year. Part I Findings: Between July 20, 2002 and July 18, 2013 there were 185 total officer-involved shootings as reported by the Dallas Police Department. Fifty-eight of those shootings resulted in fatality where the sub-classification "suspect killed" was noted in the records. Black and Hispanic fatalities combined account for 43 (74.13%) of all fatal officer involved shootings. Thirty-three of those who died at the hands of law enforcement were Black (56.89%), 10 were Hispanic (17.24%), and 15 were White (25.86%). Of the 185 officer-involved shootings reported by DPD, 127 were non-fatal, where the Sub-classification "suspect injured" or "non-injury" was noted in the records. Of those. Black and Hispanic non-fatal officer-involved shootings account for 112 (88.97%) of the 127 total incidents reported. There were 71 Black (55.9%), 42 Hispanic (33.07%), 13 White (10.2%), 1 Asian (0.78%) non-fatal shootings reported. Overall, (fatal and non-fatal) there were 156 Black and Hispanic (84.32%) individuals involved in an officer-involved shooting, with 28 White (15.13%) victims during the same time period. 179 (96.75%) of total officer involved shootings victims were Male, with 57 ending in fatality (98.27% of all fatalities). 6 (60%) of total female victims were Black and Hispanic. DCOC compares the racial demographics to OIS to emphasize the disparity. Part II Findings: According to Dallas Police records analyzed by DCOC from 2003 to 2012 there were 167 total OIS from 2003-2012. In Dallas Police Chief David Brown's press release from December 30, 2013 he reports only 102 for the same time period, highlighting a major discrepancy in reporting on behalf of DPD. For example, in 2012 Chief Brown reported only 15 OIS, but public records and media accounts confirm that by August there were a total of 22 by the end of the year. If this were an isolated incident Chief Brown may be able to explain it away. The reality is that in nearly every single year during that ten-year period reported by the Dallas Police Department they omitted OIS.

The City of Dallas' Black (African American) community represented 25% of the total population according to the 2010 US Census. DCOC calculated the total number of fatal and non-fatal officer-involved shootings, and then compared those numbers by race to get the rate of who was actually affected.

Density 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 For the entire ten-year period, Black communities in Dallas suffered non-fatal officer-involved shootings at rates far higher than their respective population density. In eight of the 10 years reported. Black communities consistently suffered at twice the average, and in many cases much higher. 2011 reported the highest percent at 63.6%, while 2007 was the lowest at 30%.

The rate at which Black men and women are killed by the Dallas Police far outweighs their respective representation in the population. In 8 out of 10 years, Black individuals suffered at twice the rate of the U.S. Census population, although the time period varies from Part I. 2007 represents the high at an appalUng 83.33%, while 2003 is the lowest at 28.57%. % Black Fatal Officer Involved Shootings Poo^ 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012"^ p) Black Fatal OIS 28.57 60 50 67 83.33 60 60 44.44 50 70 ^010 Population 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25 25^ The narrative remains the same when combining Black and Hispanic populations, although the disparity between population and rate of incident is slightly lower. The reason is the Hispanic population comprises a much larger portion of the population at 42.4%, but represents a much smaller number of the shooting incidents. This creates downward bias in the overall picture created when combining the data for both communities. % Black and Hispanic Non-Fatal OIS vs 2010 Pop.

In 2003 and 2009, the percentage was 91.67%, while 2008 represents the lowest rate at 70%. In 2006, 2007, and 2011, all non-fatal shootings involved communities of color. % Black and Hispanic Non-Fatal Officer Involved Shootings % BH Non-Fatal 91.67 i 85 88.89 100 100 70 91.67 88.9 100 2010 Population 67.4j ^ 67.4 67.4 67.4 ^16 17 16 15 16 12 ^=1 The argument is clear that communities of color are exposed to a devastating and ongoing level of deadly force by the Dallas PoUce.

In fact, for 2006, 2007, and 2011 there were zero white individuals subject to a non-fatal police shooting. The ten year high was 30% in 2008. Death in Custody: From 1991 to 2012, the Dallas Police Department reported a total of 51 deaths in custody. Of those 35 were Black (68.62%), 9 were White (17.64%), and 7 were Hispanic (13.72). According to BJS, between 2003 and 2009 there were 4,813 deaths of suspects nationally that occurred during, or shortly after, state or local law enforcement officers engaged in an arrest or restraint process. Of those, 32% were Black and 20% were Hispanic, for a combined 52%. In the same time period the Dallas Police Department, on average, killed black individuals at a 26.41% higher rate than the national average based solely on officer involved shootings. For the same time period death in custody fatalities, 18 of 20 (90%) were Black or Hispanic. U.S. Department of Justice Investigation: In order to hold a municipality Uable for a violation of constitutional right, plaintiffs must prove that the action taken was pursuant to official municipal policy and that the poUcy caused the alleged constitutional injury. The City of Dallas and Dallas Police Department's application of a "Shoot to Kill Policy", and lack of a formal "Foot Pursuit PoUcy" at the time of the shootings subject to this report, are clearly incriminating. It is also clear that until recently, the inaction of high ranking officials within the Dallas Police Department, City of Dallas, and the Dallas County District Attorney's Office officially condoned the application of a biased use of deadly force policy in excess, failing consistently to hold officers accountable or to conduct additional independent investigations in a timely manner. These purposeful actions created and continued to further a perpetrated culture of violence against communities of color by the Dallas PoUce. Connick V. Thompson (2011) established that "Official municipal poUcy includes. ..practices so persistent and widespread as to practically have the force of law." DCOC alleges that the clear pattern and practice of excessive force against Blacks and Hispanics, acted and continues to act as a de-facto municipal policy. Being targeted by law enforcement based on national origin or race is prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Our data supports the argument that the City of Dallas reUes on race, not reasonable suspicion, to make decisions about whom to use deadly force against. According to Judge Shira Scheindlin who recently found that the New York Police Department's "Stop and Frisk" poUcy was unconstitutional: "Intentional discrimination can be proved in several ways, two of which are relevant here. A plaintiff can show: (1) that a facially neutral law or policy has been appUed in an intentionally discriminatory manner; or (2) that a law or policy expressly classifies persons on the basis of race, and that the classification does not survive strict scrutiny. Because there is rarely direct proof of discriminatory intent, circumstantial evidence of such intent is permitted. "The impact of the official action — whether it bears more heavily on one race than another — may provide an important starting point." Before we are able to compare the Dallas Police Department's response to DCOC, we must first define what we mean when we say "officer-involved shooting." According to the Dallas Police General Order 906.02(E ). in order for an officer to be authorized in drawing or displaying his/her firearm, a threat or reasonable belief that there is a threat to life must exist, or the officer must have a reasonable fear for their own safety and/or the safety of others. Taking this into account in conjunction with the "Shoot to Kill" training that Dallas police receive, we can assume that if a shot is fired the goal is to kill or cause injury to the target in an effort to protect their Ufe, or the life of others. Only after shot(s) are fired may the incident be categorized as an "officer-involved shooting". Regardless of whether the suspect was injured, killed or apprehended, if shots are fired and race is identified, DCOC categorizes the incident as an "officer-involved shooting". Conversely, unless the incident ends in an injury or a fatality, the Dallas Police Department does not report the incident as an officer-involved shooting. Conclusion: The 56.89% fatal and 51.07% non-fatal officer-involved shooting rates for Black individuals are more than double the 2010 Demographic Profile Data provided by the U.S. Census Bureau, which shows that African Americans comprised 25% of the total population of the City of Dallas. The combined Black and Hispanic populations of the City of Dallas is 67.4%. This means officer involved shootings for the same Black and Hispanic communities of color are 11.78% higher than the representative populations. Comparing fatal (74.13%), and non-fatal (81.15%) Black and Hispanic shootings, the pattern holds. The ten year history of officer-involved shootings for the Dallas PoUce Department confirms that Blacks and Hispanics suffer a much higher rate of violence than was previously known, and provides a clear picture of overwhelming bias in the appUcation of deadly force. There is an ongoing disproportionate threat to Blacks and Hispanics of being shot and killed by the Dallas Police. DCOC has determined that shooting victims were targeted by Dallas Police specifically based upon race, and that race was the determining factor for the use of deadly force, both which violate the Fourteenth Amendment.

BROWN CHIEF OF POLICE Revised 06/19/09 906.00 USE OF DEADLY FORCE 906.01 Philosophy A. This philosophy is intended as a broad guide to the use of deadly force and as a moral and ethical approach to the use of deadly force policy. Although not intended as a strictly enforced set of njles, the philosophy statement describes the manner in which the procedures will be applied. B. Protection of human life is a primary goal of the Police Department; therefore, police officers have a responsibility to use only the degree of force necessary to protect and preserve life. C. Deadly force will be used with great restraint and as a last resort only when the level of resistance warrants the use of deadly force. The Dallas Police Department places a greater value on human life than on the protection of property; therefore, the use of deadly force Is not allowed to protect property interests. 906.02 Use of Deadly Force Policy A. Justification for the Use of Deadly Force -In all situations, justification for the use of deadly force must be limited to the facts reasonably apparent to the officer at the time the officer decides to use the force. B. Definitions 1 . Reasonably Perceive - The facts or circumstances the employee l<nows, or should know, that would cause an ordinary and prudent peace officer to act or think in a similar way under similar circumstances. 2. Reasonable Alternative - An action that may be taken by the officer that may allow the officer to avoid the use of deadly force. 3. Reasonable Belief - A belief that would be held by an ordinary and prudent person in the same circumstances as the actor. 4. Serious Bodily Injury - Bodily injury that creates a substantial risk of death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss of impaiment of the ftjnction of any bodily member or organ. C. Avoiding the Use of Deadly Force 1. At the point when an officer should reasonably perceive the potential exists that deadly force may be an outcome of any situation, the officer must use reasonable alternatives if time and opportunities permit. The reasonableness of the action is based upon the time available, the opportunity of performing the action, and the facts apparent to the officer prior to and during the incident. 2. Planned and supervised hazardous entry situations are recognized as meeting the requirements of reasonable altematives above. 3. Officers will not fire their weapons under conditions that would unnecessarily subject bystanders or hostages to death or possible injury except to preserve life or to prevent serious bodily injury. D. Authorization to Use Deadly Force -Officers will only use deadly force to protect themselves or another person from imminent death or serious bodily injury. E. Drawing or Displaying Fireamis - Officers may draw or display fireanns when there is a threat or reasonable belief that there is a threat to life or they have a reasonable fear for their own safety and/or the safety of others. F. Discharging Firearms at Moving Vehicles - 1 . Discharging fireanns at a moving or fleeing vehicle is prohibited unless it is necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury to the officer or another person. 2. Officers will not voluntarily place themselves in a position in front of an oncoming vehicle where deadly force is a probable outcome. 3. When confronting an oncoming vehicle, officers will move out of its path, if possible, rather than fire at the vehicle. G. Officers will not fire warning shots. H. Policy Restrictions - The restrictions of this policy shall not apply if an off-duty officer acts within the provisions of current state statutes to protect the employee's personal property. In this case the officer is acting as a private citizen.
