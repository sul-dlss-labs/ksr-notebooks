? An Olathe officer shot and killed a man who police said was suicidal, ending a six-hour standoff.

Bryan E. Jones, 36, was shot about 4 a.m. Tuesday when he walked out the front door of a house with a firearm and threatened authorities, police said.

Police would not discuss how Jones threatened police, citing the continuing investigation.

Neighbor Jim Van Houten said he watched the shooting from his house across the street.

“He came out the front and was screaming at them to turn off the bright lights,” Van Houten said. “The next thing I know, I saw him pull out a shotgun and shoot toward the (tactical) vehicle.”

Jones’ girlfriend called police to the house Monday night. When authorities arrived she said Jones was suicidal, said Olathe Police Sgt. Greg O’Halloran.

The officer who shot the man, a nine-year veteran, is on paid administrative leave until the investigation is complete, O’Halloran said.
