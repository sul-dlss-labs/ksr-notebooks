TheSt. JohnsCountyman who was shot onKatnack Roadon Wednesday died from a gunshot wound to the head, according to the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office.

District Medical Examiner Predrag Bulic performed an autopsy on Rodney Wayne Stevens, 64, and released the findings today.

The deputy who fired the shot, Thomas Coward, 29, has been placed on administrative leave, according to the Sheriff's Office. That is standard procedure when an officer is involved in a shooting.

Deputies went to the house around 12:30 p.m. Wednesday after someone reported that another person at the house was armed and threatening people.

The house is off U.S. 1 about eight miles north of St. Augustine and five miles east of World Golf Village.

When deputies arrived at the house, Stevens came outside and ran back inside. He threatened to get a gun.

Deputies went inside the house and confronted Stevens in a back bedroom, and at some point the deputy shot Stevens, according to the Sheriff's Office. Detectives found a loaded shotgun on the bed.

Authorities with the State Attorney's Office and the Medical Examiner are investigating.
