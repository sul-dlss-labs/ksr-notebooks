A fatal shooting involving Creek County deputies and a Bristow police officer Wednesday night in Kellyville is being investigated by the OSBI, according to a media release.

Mark Smith of Kellyville was killed after a confrontation with deputies and other authorities, including Bristow police, who responded to a domestic violence call about 8 p.m., the release said.

When authorities arrived, Smith was in a nearby field but fled into the metal building where he was living on the same property as his estranged wife. After speaking with officers by cell phone, he left the building in a truck and appeared to show authorities a rifle in the cab of the vehicle, OSBI said.

Smith, who was accused of assaulting his estranged wife and her child, drove his truck into a Bristow officer, knocking the officer down. Three deputies and a Bristow police officer then opened fire on the vehicle, according to the release.

Smith, who was taken to St. John Medical Center in Tulsa, was pronounced dead about 2 a.m. Thursday, OSBI said.

The Bristow officer who was hit by the vehicle was not seriously injured.

According to the release, OSBI agents will investigate the shooting and forward their report to the district attorney to determine whether the shooting was justified.

The state Medical Examiner’s Office will perform an autopsy on Smith’s body.

Two of the three deputies have been restricted to limited duty and the third has been placed on administrative leave, pending the review by the District Attorney’s Office, according a release from the Creek County Sheriff’s Office. The Bristow officer also has been placed on administrative leave, according to the release.

The sheriff’s office said the names of the deputy and the Bristow officer were not being released at this time.
