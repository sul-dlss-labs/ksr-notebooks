A Bowling Green man is dead following an officer involved shooting in Butler County.

Kentucky State Police Post 3 Bowling Green say they were notified just after 2:00 am Sunday that a Butler County Deputy had been involved in the shooting after being dragged by a vehicle on Logansport Road, near the intersection of Dave Gaskey Lane in the city limits of Morgantown.

Deputy Chris Reneer of the Butler County Sheriff's Office made a traffic stop on a vehicle that was believed to have people who had outstanding warrants.

During attempts to positively identify the passenger, 43-year-old Randy Clark Jr. of Bowling Green, he became aggressive and got involved in a physical alteration with Deputy Reneer.

During the altercation the driver of the vehicle, who is not being identified by police, exited the vehicle.

Reneer used his taser on Clark, who continued to be aggressive and gained access to the driver’s side of the vehicle and accelerated, dragging Deputy Reneer.

Reneer fired multiple shots from his handgun, striking Clark multiple times.

"At that point, he had no other course of action to protect himself from serious injury or from death," Public Information Officer with Kentucky State Police Post 3, Trooper B.J. Eaton said.

The vehicle continued a short distance before coming to a stop after striking a guardrail at the intersection of Logansport Road and Dave Gaskey Lane, allowing Deputy Reneer to free himself from the vehicle.

Clark was pronounced dead at the scene by the Butler County Coroner’s Office.

Clark was wanted on multiple outstanding warrants in Warren County and by Probation and Parole.

Deputy Reneer was taken to the Medical Center in Bowling Green by Butler County EMS for treatment of non-life threatening injuries.

Kentucky State Police are not releasing any more information on the man who was with Clark at the time.

An autopsy will be performed on Clark at the Medical Examiner's Office in Louisville on Sunday.
