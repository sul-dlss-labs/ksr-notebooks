OZARK, AL (WSFA) - A high-speed chase in Dale County turned deadly late Wednesday evening.

According to the Ozark Police a drug suspect led authorities down U.S. Highway 231 towards Montgomery around 9:30pm.

The man, identified as 39-year-old Ronald Charles Pugh, was initially pulled over on a traffic violation, but quickly fled the scene.

Pugh's 1997 Chevrolet Tahoe SUV barreled down the road at speeds of more than 100 mph. Investigators say he eventually crossed the median heading north in the southbound lanes and slammed head-on into a 2003 Toyota Carolla.

The driver of the Toyota, Charles Edward Knight, 57 of Ozark, was killed in the collision. Pugh was rushed to Dale Medical Center where doctors treated him for non life-threatening injuries.

Police say the suspect crossed over the median and headed towards on-coming traffic.

Investigators say a large amount of narcotics were recovered at the scene and the incident remains under investigation.

Alabama State Troopers confirm they are working the case as a homicide investigation in connection with the crash.
