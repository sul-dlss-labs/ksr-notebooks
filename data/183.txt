A man who the police said beat and slashed his elderly mother before storming onto a Queens street with a handgun and knife was fatally shot by officers yesterday morning, the authorities said.

The man, James Murphy Jr., 43, was shot at least seven times on his street in Maspeth as he walked toward a group of officers, dropped a knife and his denim jacket into a puddle of water, pointed a black Luger handgun at them and began yelling, ''I guess you got me now,'' law enforcement officials and witnesses said.

The officers began firing, witnesses and police officials said, after Mr. Murphy refused to comply with repeated pleas to drop the weapon. The officers had gone to the Murphy home, on 53rd Avenue near 73rd Street, after receiving a 911 call that Mr. Murphy was beating and slashing his 70-year-old mother, Dorothy, in the front yard.

Witnesses and police officials said that a neighbor, Michael Koto, 31, helped Mrs. Murphy get away from her son, who was wielding a knife, before officers arrived about 9:30 a.m. By then, Mr. Murphy had gone back into the house and retrieved a handgun, the witnesses and officials said.
