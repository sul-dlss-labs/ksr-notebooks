Officers are investigating how a suspect died in police custody.Milwaukee police said it happened after a traffic stop Wednesday night.Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman held a news conference Thursday afternoon to try to address what happened.He said at about 8 p.m., officers pulled a driver over in the 1600 block of South Caesar Chavez Drive.The stop was connected to an ongoing drug investigation, Norman said, it was not random.The officers arrested a 27-year-old Milwaukee man and took him to District 2 headquarters.While there, Norman said officers recognized the suspect needed medical attention.They believed he ingested unknown drugs before being arrested, the chief said.Officers took him to Ascension St. Francis Hospital for treatment."Out of respect for each individual's right to privacy and to comply with applicable state and federal laws, Ascension Wisconsin is unable to comment," the hospital group told WISN 12.Norman said staff at the hospital medically cleared the man and he was taken back to District 2.While there, he suffered an additional medical emergency and was then taken to Froedtert Hospital for additional treatment.The chief said he believed the suspect was in a holding cell when he experienced the medical emergency and not in a squad car.The man was alive when he was taken to the hospital, Norman said.He was pronounced dead there Thursday morning.Family members identified him Monday as Queivonta Quentez Moffett.His body was transferred to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office where an autopsy will be conducted Friday.Toxicology results typically take several weeks to be released.The Medical Examiner's Office said the death was being investigated as a probable drug overdose.
