Investigative documents paint a clearer picture of the Oct. 4 Vancouver police shooting that resulted in the death of Andrew A. Williams, a 41-year-old homeless man with a history of drug use and run-ins with law enforcement.

Williams was in an on-and-off relationship with a woman he stabbed with a screwdriver on the night he was shot.

Investigators previously reported he was covered in blood when officers approached him; the blood was likely his own, as the woman’s teenage son stabbed Williams with a pocket knife to protect his mother, according to documents obtained by The Columbian through a public records request.

The Southwest Washington Regional Independent Investigative Team finished looking into the shooting in about a month, releasing little information during that time. Clark County Prosecutor Tony Golik said he planned to have an outside prosecutor review the investigation and make a legal determination on the two officers’ use of deadly force.

Golik said Thursday he has not yet handed over the review to another office but hopes to do so by next week.
