The Travis County district attorney’s office on Monday said officers involved in a 2018 shooting in Central Austin in which a man suspected of targeting YouTube stars was found dead will not face criminal charges.

Christopher Giles, 23, died on Jan. 26, 2018, in the 4500 block of Avenue G. Police responded to the Hyde Park area after getting a call from a couple who said a man had fired a gun into their house, then came inside.

When officers arrived, they spotted Giles leaving the home and getting into a black Cadillac parked out front. The officers shouted at Giles to stop after he backed up a few feet, then heard a gunshot coming from the car. Officer Stephen Abbott moved out of the line of sight while his partner, Officer Matthew Jackson, returned fire. Three of Jackson's shots hit Giles, but an autopsy report later found that he had already died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound when he was hit, officials said.

Investigators suspected Giles traveled to Austin from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to target YouTubers Gavin Free and Megan Turney. A search warrant affidavit filed in New Mexico after the shooting said police sought to search Giles’ residence after the incident because they believed “evidence related to the planned burglary and homicides of Megan Turney and Gavin Free will be found,” the warrant said.

While searching Giles’ phone, detectives found notes in which he mentioned Turney and Free, along with threatening recordings about Free. One of them said: “I want Gavin Free to die alone, with no children,” the warrant said.

“Based upon these notations, it was apparent that Giles developed a fondness of Turney yet resented Free for his lifestyle and success,” the warrant said.

Free and Turney did not respond to requests for comment after the shooting. However, the pair tweeted out thanks to Austin police and supporters.
