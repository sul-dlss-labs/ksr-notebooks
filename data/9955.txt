One issue is whether the phenomenon of police overresponse to a crime contributed to the confusion. In short order, more than a dozen police officers — even that count is murky — converged that Saturday evening in Massapequa Park on one house, making for an overpopulated scene that was difficult to control, with officers who did not know one another, their guns out.

Louis R. Anemone, the former chief of department of the New York Police Department, was loath to evaluate something he was not involved in, but he did say that the appropriate number of officers answering a call is an issue as old as policing itself.

“Throughout my career, cops have always been eager to respond, to help, to get to the scene, and it is one of the inherent dangers of police work,” he said. “There is a very, very, very fine balance.”

The case remains under investigation, and no charges have been filed. As yet, no consensus has been reached on how things ended as they did, and some questions may never be answered.

Three Officers

Police officers run deep through this story. A good number come home to the Cape Cods and ranches of Massapequa Park itself — including Mr. Cafarella. One officer lives down the block from the site of the shootings, but he was out at a movie with his wife at the time. A 79-year-old retired officer lives two doors away from the scene. He was at home watching TV that night and did not come out. He was in his pajamas.
