METAIRIE, LA (WVUE) - A man who fled a traffic stop was killed Tuesday morning when he was ejected from his SUV after hitting a utility pole while being chased by Jefferson Parish deputies.

Just after 1:20 a.m., deputies pulled over the driver of a 2014 Nissan Murano near the intersection of Clearview Parkway and West Napoleon Avenue. As the deputy approached, the driver of the vehicle stepped out of the car to speak with the officer.

While the officer was standing in the doorway, the driver, identified as 26-year-old Boubacar Kanoute of Texas, suddenly pulled the door closed, hitting the officer with the door, and sped away from the scene.

A chase ensued onto North I-10 Service Road South. As Kanoute was nearing the intersection of North Hullen Street and South I-10 Service Road, he lost control of the vehicle, overturned and hit a utility pole. He was ejected from the vehicle and pronounced dead at the scene.

At this point, investigators do not know why the driver fled the scene of the first traffic stop.

An autopsy has been scheduled for Wednesday.
