[October 20, 2011] Authorities ID Man Shot, Killed by CHP on 91 Freeway Tweet

Oct 19, 2011 (KTLA-TV - McClatchy-Tribune Information Services via COMTEX) -- CORONA, Calif. -- Authorities have identified a man who was shot and killed by officer on the 91 Freeway in Corona Tuesday night.



CHP officers responded to the scene of a single-vehicle crash involving a 2004 Porsche Cayenne just after 7:45 p.m. on the eastbound 91 Freeway between Main Street and the 15 Freeway. When officers arrived, they saw a man on the side of the road with a gun, a CHP dispatcher told KTLA.







He has been identified by the Riverside County Sheriff-Coroner as 59-year-old Gary Dean Heil.



Officers told Heil to drop the weapon, but he refused and fired it at the officers, prompting them to shoot him, CHP officials said.





The shooting jammed traffic on the busy Inland Empire freeway for hours as the investigation continued.



All four eastbound lanes were shut down for about 10 hours, causing major traffic delays. At least two westbound lanes were also closed during the investigation.



Homicide detectives from the Corona Police Department are investigating the shooting. The CHP will also conduct a concurrent investigation.



As a matter of procedure, the officers involved will be placed on administrative leave during the investigation, officials said.
