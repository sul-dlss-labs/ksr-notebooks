A drug dealer who died during a drug raid in downtown Dallas last week shot himself, city officials said Saturday.

Authorities confronted Keelan Charles Murray, 37, on Dec. 8 at an apartment in the 1500 block of Commerce Street after he received and opened a delivery of synthetic opiates.

While clearing the apartment, members of a drug Drug Enforcement Administration Task Force heard a gunshot as they made their way up a staircase.

Hearing a second shot, a Duncanville police officer who was part of the task force fired a shot at Murray, who was armed with a handgun.

The officer's bullet hit Murray in the shoulder, Assistant City Manager Eric D. Campbell said in a released statement.

Murray then apparently shot himself with his own handgun.

Murray previously made headlines in May 1999 when he sold heroin to Dallas Cowboys lineman Mark Tuinei, who later overdosed and died.

The 39-year-old former Cowboy had reportedly taken ecstasy in the hours before meeting Murray at a Far North Dallas apartment and taking heroin, according to court records.
