The Baltimore County police officer who fatally wounded a Catonsville man - seconds after the man shot and killed his estranged wife - was probably justified in his actions, police officials said yesterday.

Matthew S. Paul, an officer from the Essex Precinct, shot and killed Kevin Page, 33, on Wednesday evening during a call for a domestic dispute in Essex.

Kevin Page shot and killed his estranged wife, Lisa Marie Page, 30, as the officer arrived at the woman's apartment in the first block of Banyan Wood Court.

The couple had separated, police said, and apparently began fighting when Kevin Page of the 200 block of Winters Lane went to his wife's apartment. Lisa Page had been arrested on Sept. 20 for violating a protection order that her husband had obtained against her, according to court records.

Bill Toohey, a police spokesman, said it appears that Kevin Page did not fire at the officer. But Toohey said Paul needed to take immediate action.

"There is nothing to indicate he was not justified," Toohey said. "When you come upon a scene and someone is shooting someone else, you have to take pretty direct action."

Toohey said investigators must still determine whether Paul ordered the suspect to drop his weapon before firing.
