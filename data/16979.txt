The state Attorney General has cleared an NYPD cop of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of a man who led cops on a high speed chase from the Bronx into Yonkers last December.

Officer Garthlette James shot and killed Miguel Espinal Dec. 8, 2015 in a stand of trees in Yonkers following the car chase which raged up and down the Henry Hudson Parkway at speeds approaching 90 miles per hour.

"Based on an extensive investigation, we found no criminal culpability for the officer," a source familiar with the investigation said. "All of the forensic evidence corroborates what the officer said, that Espinal was trying to grab the officer's gun during a struggle."

After fleeing his car, Espinal ran into the woods. James chased him and the two ended up in a violent struggle. Investigators found traces of gunpowder on Espinal and developed evidence that the two were less than 18 inches apart when James fired his gun, hitting Espinal in the chest.

Rather than stopping, Mr. Espinal sped onto the Henry Hudson Parkway, slammed into two other cars, and continued onto the Saw Mill River Parkway, where he made a U-turn, drove south against traffic in the northbound lane, and collided with three other civilian vehicles.

Eventually Espinal, who was driving, ran into the woods next to the highway.

They were just 18 inches apart from each other, investigators concluded. Their bodies each had scratches consistent with a struggle in the woods.
