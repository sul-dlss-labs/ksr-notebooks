BARRON, Wis. (AP) -- A standoff in Barron in which shots were fired ended when the suspect allegedly killed himself.

The Sheriff's Department says officers went to a motor home east of Cameron on Thursday afternoon after a woman reported being held against her will there by her armed husband the previous night.

Authorities say 49-year-old James Bacon refused to come out, threatened officers, threatened to blow up the motor home and fired three shots when officers in an armored vehicle deployed gas into the motor home. No officers were injured.

Deputies eventually entered the home after negotiations failed and found Bacon dead of what authorities say appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. No officers fired any shots during the incident.
