A 27-year-old Cheyenne man has been charged with aggravated vehicular homicide-DUI and a slew of other charges after a high-speed chase and rollover that claimed the life of one of his passengers.

Wyoming Highway Patrol Lt. Tim Romig says it all started when a trooper tried to stop a stolen pickup near the intersection of U.S. Highway 85 and Fox Farm Road around 7 p.m. Saturday.

Romig says the driver, later identified as Aaron Higine, took off east down E. Fox Farm Road, reaching speeds of 80 mph in a posted 40 mph zone.

"(He) was very aggressive toward other vehicles in the area as far as going into oncoming lanes (and) not stopping at a stop sign," said Romig.

"It was within a minute from the time the trooper activated his lights, (Higine) attempted to pass a vehicle that turned left in front of him," Romig added. "(He) swerved to the right and then there was some over-correction and he rolled."

Higine's front seat passenger, 19-year-old Angel Bell of Cheyenne, was thrown from the pickup and died at the scene.

Higine and a rear seat passenger were taken to Cheyenne Regional Medical Center for treatment and released.
