A man was found dead in Perris on Sunday morning after he opened fire on Riverside County sheriff's deputies, injuring one of them, investigators said.

The man had barricaded himself in a home on Bond Street, the sheriff's department said Sunday afternoon. He had a gunshot wound and a handgun was discovered at the scene.

His name hadn't been released as of Sunday afternoon.

The standoff began about 9:15 a.m. when deputies were in the area of Bond and San Jacinto Avenue for an investigation involving a wanted person. The department didn't specify why they were looking for him.

Officers were outside a home in the 100 block of Bond Street when someone began shooting at them, according to the sheriff's department.

"Suspect is armed and dangerous and believed to be contained," the department said in a tweet Sunday morning.

Multiple agencies responded to the scene and officials used armored vehicles to remove several deputies who were pinned down, according to the sheriff's department.

Paramedics took one officer to a hospital for injuries that weren't life-threatening, but officials didn't specify if the injury was a gunshot wound.

Photos posted on the department's Twitter account showed multiple police vehicles in the area.

Several homes were evacuated while authorities tried to get the man to surrender. They discovered the man's body after the sheriff's department's Hazardous Device Unit sent a robot inside the home.

Investigators aren't searching for other suspects and there's no threat to the public, according to the sheriff's department.

The deputies involved in the incident are being placed on administrative leave.
