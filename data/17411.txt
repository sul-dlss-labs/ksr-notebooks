SAN ANTONIO â€“ KSAT-12 spoke with a family member of a man shot and killed Wednesday morning by San Antonio police SWAT officers. The relative identified the man as Eric Hernandez, 33.

The Bexar County Medical Examiner's Office has not yet released the identity of the man.

The shooting happened around 10 a.m. in the 300 block of East Pyron Avenue on the South Side, Police Chief William McManus said.

McManus said the man got into an altercation with neighbors who were moving furniture and fired shots at their home around 2 a.m.

The man went back inside his home, and while a search warrant was being prepared, officers kept watch to make sure he didn't come out again with a gun, McManus said.

When SWAT arrived around 10 a.m. to the serve the warrant, the man came out of the house armed with a weapon and started pacing in front of his home and in the street, McManus said.

When the man moved to the side of his home, SWAT officers fired multiple times, killing him, McManus said.

Karen Sullivan, a parishoner at a nearby church, said she is praying for all involved.

"We're praying for them. We know them personally. It's just sad. You know. What can you do?" Sullivan said.

It's not clear why the man fired the shots, McManus said.
