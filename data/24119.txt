The knife-wielding woman killed Saturday morning by Johns Creek police officers has been identified.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified the woman as 36-year-old Shukri Ali Said. Said was fatally shot around 7:15 a.m. Saturday during an encounter on Abbots Bridge Road near Sweet Creek Road, authorities said.

Johns Creek police were dispatched to the area after a 911 call from an address on Windherst Lane reported a “demented person” armed with a knife.

The officers encountered the woman now identifed as Said near Northview High School and, according to Capt. Chris Byers, “several attempts were made to de-escalate the encounter through the use of less lethal force.”

Those efforts included the use of a Taser and a foam impact round, Byers said. But the suspect refused to drop the knife and two officers opened fire.

After Said was struck, the responding officers “immediately applied life-saving measures and she was transported to Emory Johns Creek Hospital, where she was pronounced dead,” Byers said.

The two officers that fired at Said have not been identified but are on administrative leave pending the conclusion of the GBI’s investigation, officials said.
