BEAVERTON, Ore. (KOIN) — A Beaverton police officer shot and killed an armed man who was “acting erratically” on the roof of a house Tuesday morning.

Police first received a call about a man pointing a handgun from the roof of a home on the 2000 block of SW 170th Avenue around 7:40 a.m.

The man, later identified as 51-year-old Douglas Michael Smith, was “agitated, waving the gun and pointing it into the residence and towards the street,” police said.

Smith’s wife told KOIN 6 News he was worried about an intruder inside the house, and decided to get on the roof with his handgun.

Beaver Acres Elementary, which is just across the street from the home, and Merlo Station High School just a short distance away, were put on lockdown.

Officers who arrived on the scene reportedly tried talking to Smith, but he refused to answer and pointed his gun towards them, police said. Smith then fired one round into the house before 2 officers responded by shooting him.

Right after shooting Smith, officers said they went into the home to get onto the roof and start giving him medical treatment. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Both officers who shot Smith were placed on paid administrative leave.

The investigation continues.
