A South Carolina man suspected of killing four people, including his wife and ex-wife, killed himself Sunday after leading police on a chase back to the scene of three of the slayings, authorities said.

Kenneth Myers, 46, was driving his dead ex-wife’s car when deputies began chasing him early Sunday morning, Aiken County Sheriff’s Capt. Charles Barranco said.

Officers fired several shots at Myers as he tried to ram their cruisers before the chase ended back at the home where deputies found three people dead around 6 p.m. Saturday. Myers then apparently shot himself.

Aiken County Coroner Tim Carlton identified the dead as Myers’ wife, 25-year-old Angela Myers; her twin sister, Tabitha Brown; her mother, 50-year-old Vicki Brown; and Myers’ ex-wife, 47-year-old Esther Baldwin. All four died from single gunshots.

Police were checking in with several more people who they thought could be threatened by Myers when they found him and he fled, Barranco said.

Investigators spent all night trying to piece together why Myers might have gone on the killing spree. Deputies weren’t immediately familiar with him before Saturday night.

“It’s hard to say at this point in the investigation why those people were killed,” Barranco said.

Phone calls to several listings related to Myers were not answered Sunday.

Investigators have uncovered some threats Myers made to people in the past, but people who have been interviewed so far didn’t think he would turn violent, Barranco said.

The first three bodies were discovered in a secluded, rural home near Wagener, about 40 miles east of Augusta, Ga. Deputies going to check on another person living nearby discovered Baldwin’s body about seven hours later, authorities said.

Investigators initially thought Myers might be heading for Alabama before finding him not far from where all the killings took place.

“We need to try to find some answers,” Barranco said. “We had a lot of people out all night.”
