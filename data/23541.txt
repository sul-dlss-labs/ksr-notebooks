SOUTH GATE >> An armed suspect was shot and killed today in an officer-involved shooting in South Gate.

The shooting stemmed from an attempted traffic stop and short pursuit at 4:13 p.m. in the 9800 block of Bowman Avenue, said Deputy Sara Rodriguez of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, which is assisting South Gate police in the investigation.

South Gate officers attempted to stop a gold Lexus for a traffic violation when the car failed to stop and the driver led officers on a two- minute pursuit. The driver stopped the car and was detained while the car’s passenger walked away, Rodriguez said.

The passenger was later found by assisting officers inside a shed in the backyard of a residence where he brandished a handgun at the officers and an officer-involved shooting occurred. Two officers discharged their firearms several times, striking the suspect at least once in his upper body, according to Rodriguez.

The suspect was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, she said. No officers were injured in the shooting.

It wasn’t immediately clear if the suspect discharged his handgun, which was recovered at the scene. The suspect’s name was not immediately released.
