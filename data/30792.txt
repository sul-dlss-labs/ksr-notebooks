BURLESON COUNTY, Texas (KBTX) - The suspect in the 8-hour standoff is dead, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety.

James Matalice Smith, 41, of Somerville, was the armed suspect who barricaded himself inside a home along FM 60 west of Snook near County Road 230 after shooting Chief Deputy John Pollock, according to DPS. Pollock was shot while trying to serve a warrant at that home.

A trooper was also shot in the arm and was taken to St. Joseph Health Regional Hospital in Bryan. The trooper is in stable condition.

DPS says around 3 a.m. the suspect was coming out of his home, with law enforcement believing he was surrendering. As law enforcement attempted to take him into custody Smith fired a gun at the trooper, hitting him in the arm. DPS says law enforcement returned fire, shooting the suspect. Smith was treated by Burleson County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) and was later pronounced dead at the scene by a Burleson County Judge.

DPS confirmed the stand-off ended at 3:15 a.m. Wednesday. The home is now secure.

Pollock was rushed to Baylor Scott & White Hospital in College Station and later transferred to St. Joseph Health in Bryan.

‚ÄúHe has suffered a serious gunshot wound and from what I‚Äôm understanding he will recover but it is a serious situation,‚Äù said Burleson County Sheriff Gene Hermes.

According to a Facebook post on behalf of his wife, Pollock is ‚Äúin a lot of pain‚Äù and the family is discussing surgery now.

FM 60 in the area of County Road 230 is still closed as of 2 p.m. Wednesday. DPS says motorists should avoid the area
