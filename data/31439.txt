A New York State Police trooper shot and killed a young man in the small upstate village of Unadilla on Wednesday night after the man confronted the officer with a knife, the police said.

Mark A. Beilby, 24, had repeatedly refused to drop the knife and had “advanced at the trooper,” whom authorities did not identify, the State Police said. The trooper, responding to a 911 call, had entered Mr. Beilby’s home in response to reports of a domestic dispute. After the trooper shot him, Mr. Beilby was transported to two separate medical centers but died.

On Thursday, Attorney General Letitia James’s office said it would investigate the shooting, as required by law in cases of officer-involved killings.

In a news conference on Thursday, Major Jeffrey VanAuken of State Police Troop C said that Mr. Beilby had been shot in his apartment after confronting the trooper, who was not injured.
