COBB COUNTY, Ga. — The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday a person was shot in Austell late Monday night by a Cobb County Police officer after "brandishing a handgun" at the end of a chase.

The 17-year-old, who was later identified as Vincent Demario Truitt, died at the hospital Tuesday from his injuries.

Two other males arrested at the scene were 17 and 15 years old, the bureau said.

In a release, the GBI said that Cobb County officers "located a stolen vehicle being driven" on Riverside Pkwy., which had been reported stolen earlier in the day.

"Officers attempted to conduct a traffic stop on the vehicle which was occupied by three males," the release said. "The driver did not stop, and a chase ensued."

The GBI said the car eventually went behind a building and ran into a dead-end. At that point, two of the males allegedly tried to run and were chased by officers.

The GBI said a firearm was recovered from the scene. Another 17-year-old was arrested on an outstanding warrant and the 15-year-old was charged in relation to the stolen vehicle.
