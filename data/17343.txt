A police chase in Normal ended when the man being chased died after apparently shooting himself.

The incident began as an apparent hostage situation when Normal police were called to a residence on Normal Avenue by a woman claiming the man was holding her against her will. When he fled in a vehicle, police chased him until the gunshot rang out inside the vehicle as it stopped on Towanda Avenue near Rowe Drive in Bloomington.

Police say the man later died at a twin city hospital. The McLean County Coroner's office identified the man as 57-year-old David Lenzen of Derry, New Hampshire. Normal police and the coroner's office are investigating.
