NORTHAMPTON – A state police trooper was justified in using deadly force in the fatal shooting of a man at his Orange home in July, the Northwestern District Attorney's office has concluded.

Trooper Michael H. Baker shot and killed Corey J. Navarrete on July 3 while executing a search warrant for drugs at Navarrete's 18 Mechanic Street apartment. During the search, Navarrete pointed a loaded semi-automatic rifle at Baker and failed to drop the weapon despite being twice ordered to do so, the DA's reports said. Fearing Navarrete might shoot him or one of his fellow officers, Baker fired three rounds from his service weapon, two of which struck Navarrete, killing him.



Police recovered the Navarrete's rifle along with a loaded 9mm semi-automatic pistol and a backpack containing more than 150 tablets, some of which contained oxycodone, at the scene. Navarrete had a license to own the guns, the report said.

The investigation concluded that Baker shot Navarrete in defense of himself and his fellow officers. It was the first time in Baker’s 23-year tenure with the state police that he had discharged his weapon in the line of duty, the report said.

“Trooper Baker possessed an objectively reasonable fear that his life, as well as the lives of his fellow Troopers, were endangered,” the report stated. “Commendably, Trooper Baker gave Navarrete the opportunity to bring the situation to a peaceful resolution by twice ordering him to drop the weapon, an opportunity that unfortunately was squandered… Although Navarrete’s death was certainly regrettable, it was nevertheless justified.”
