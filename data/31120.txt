MILPITAS – A man died Tuesday of injuries he suffered in a shootout with police last week in Milpitas, authorities said.

The Milpitas Police Department identified the man as Michael Nelson Jr., 42, of Healdsburg.

In a news release Monday, Sgt. Jason Speckenheuer said detectives found Nelson inside a stolen vehicle at the Milpitas Square Shopping Center on Friday afternoon. Nelson initially got out of the vehicle, looked at the detectives and re-entered the vehicle.

Speckenheuer said Nelson then began shooting at the detectives, who returned fire.

Nelson was injured in the “prolonged exchange of gunfire” and was taken to a hospital, where he died, Speckenheuer said. No other injuries were reported.

A firearm was recovered at the scene, according to police.

Nelson was on California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation post-release community supervision for identity theft at the time of the shooting, Speckenheuer said.

The names of the detectives have not been released. Speckenheuer said police are continuing to interview witnesses, examine evidence and review video footage related to the shooting.

“We anticipate releasing additional details, including body worn camera footage, regarding the investigation in the future,” he said.
