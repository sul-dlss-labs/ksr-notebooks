Dexter Luckett, a 23-year-old black man, was shot and killed by Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies Wednesday, June 16, in the 16100 block of Eucalyptus Avenue in Bellflower, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Lakewood station deputies responded to a call of shots fired about 9:43 p.m., according to a sheriff's news release. When they arrived at the location, they contacted several informants who confirmed they heard gunshots in the area.

One of the informants "directed the deputies to the rear of an apartment complex" where authorities located Luckett, who they said matched the description of the shooter given by the informant.

A deputy ordered Luckett to raise his hands, walk to the radio car and place his hands on the hood. At first, Luckett raised his hands then allegedly dropped his left hand toward his waistband. According to sheriff's officials, at that point the deputy again ordered Luckett to raise his hands and he complied, but as he reached the hood of the car, he quickly dropped his left hand to his rear waistband area, out of the deputy's view.

Believing the suspect had retrieved a weapon and in fear for his life, authorities said the deputy fired one round from his duty weapon, hitting Luckett in the upper body.

However, in preliminary findings from the coroner's office, it was found that Luckett was shot twice, once in the arm and torso.

After the shooting, Luckett was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10:27 p.m., according to coroner's records.

No deputies were injured in the incident. Authorities said no weapon was recovered at the scene.
