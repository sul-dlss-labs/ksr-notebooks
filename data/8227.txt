A suspected methamphetamine addict died this morning after being tased and restrained by Fontana police who had responded to his home at the request of the man’s family.

Shawn Darrell Iinuma’s family called 911 dispatchers about 1:15 a.m. to report that he had been using meth for several days straight and was “acting strangely.”

Police and paramedics responded to his home in the 7500 block of Cherimoya. Iinuma “became violent” and struggled with officials, said Fontana police Sgt. Jeff Decker. Officers eventually tased him and put him in handcuffs.

“After being restrained, he stopped breathing,” Decker said in a written statement.

Paramedics administered CPR and rushed him to Kaiser Permanente Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The Sheriff’s Department will conduct an investigation, as is standard procedure with an in-custody death.

Iinuma had apparently stayed awake for several days while using meth, police said.

He has past convictions of possessing a controlled substance, being under the influence of drugs or alcohol and evading a police officer’s vehicle, according to San Bernardino Superior Court records.
