CHICAGO â€” Cops shot and killed a man after he stabbed a sergeant in the face Tuesday night, police said.

The man, who was identified as Terrance Harris by the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office Wednesday afternoon, lived in the 200 block of East 107th Street in Roseland, the same block where the incident occurred.

Around 10:25 p.m., officers received a call of a woman being threatened by a man with a knife, according to a statement from police. Police arrived at the home and heard loud screams from inside the home, police said.

After police sergeant and two officers forced their way inside, the 40-year-old Harris attacked the sergeant with a butcher knife, stabbing him in the face, police said. The other officers pulled the sergeant to safety and called for an ambulance, said Pat Camden, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police.

The officers smelled heavy gas fumes coming from inside the home and, unsure of what the man was planning to do, began breaking several basement windows to air out the home, Camden said. Police re-entered the home to search for the man, who then went after them again with the knife inside the furnace room. Harris was then shot and killed, Camden said.

The woman who had called police sustained minor injuries and was taken to Roseland Community Hospital, Camden said.

The 46-year-old sergeant was taken to Advocate Christ Medical Center in serious condition, Camden said. He is a 19-year veteran of the Police Department.
