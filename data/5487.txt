SPRINGFIELD TWP. A woman with a history of alcohol-related traffic offenses and her passenger were killed early Wednesday after leading police on a 2 1/2-mile chase in northern Oakland County.

Dead at the scene was passenger Juliette McCarty, 28, of Springfield Township. She was thrown from the car after it struck a tree on the east side of Bridge Lake Road, then careened back across the road into a line of trees before spinning to a stop, said Oakland County Undersheriff Michael McCabe.

Driver Katie Beauchamp, 25, of Clarkston, died two hours after she arrived at Genesys Regional Medical Center.

Neither McCarty nor Beauchamp were wearing seat belts, McCabe said.

An Oakland County Sheriffs Department crash reconstruction team investigated the accident.

Beauchamp was driving a 1996 Chevrolet Corsica north on Bridge Lake Road, north of Rattalee Lake Road, trying to evade a deputy who had attempted to stop her for a traffic violation.
