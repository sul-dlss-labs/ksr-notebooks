A man who died of a gunshot wound during an hourslong police standoff in Boston's Jamaica Plain neighborhood late Saturday night has been identified by the Boston Police Department.Police said they received a report at about 10 p.m. of a domestic disturbance at 21 Wyman St. Gross said a man, 37-year-old Isaac Rasheed Smith, fired a handgun at officers when they arrived at the scene before fleeing into the house and barricading himself inside.Authorities evacuated nearby residents while hostage negotiators tried to speak with Smith, a Jamaica Plain resident.At one point, Smith smashed a front window and brandished a gun toward officers, according to Boston Police Commissioner William Gross. An officer then fired at Smith through the window.Negotiators were unable to get in contact with Smith after the officer shot at him. After a period of time, a SWAT team stormed the building and found Smith with what Gross called a "fatal gunshot wound." Two guns were also found inside the home, officials said.Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins said the Wyman Street residence is a bed-and-breakfast.The bed-and-breakfast has been an unwelcome addition to the neighborhood to some residents, who have fought it with petitions and have spoken against it at city meetings. Those who opposed it believed it would attract trouble.“It’s different people there every day, you know, coming in and out, which is something that we’re not really proud of," said neighbor Eduardo Pineda.“It’s disturbing," said neighbor Lauren Fain. "It’s the third or fourth shooting incident in this neighborhood adjacent to this street in the last, like, three or four months.”According to Rollins, Smith lived in the home and assisted with the day-to-day operations of the property.Gross said there were 15-20 people inside the house at the time of the standoff, including children and even one infant. Rollins said there were more than 20 guests staying at the establishment. Officials said no bystanders or officers were injured in the standoff."This was a very tense standoff, and we're just happy the residents and the officers left safely," Gross said."I want to commend the Boston Police Department and their coordinated multi-unit and jurisdictional response during this dangerous and tense incident and for successfully evacuating the more than 20 guests who were staying at the establishment," Rollins said in a statement.Gross did not say how many shots were fired during the standoff and did not specify whether Smith was killed by officers or committed suicide. The Suffolk County District Attorney's Office has taken the lead on what Gross called a "death investigation." District Attorney Rachael Rollins is investigating whether the use of deadly force was necessary in this case.
