MONTCLAIR -- The Essex County Prosecutor's Office is investigating the death of a Montclair man who died after he was arrested by the township police Wednesday.

Lynn Kimbrough, 34, was pronounced dead at Mountainside Hospital in Glen Ridge at 8:32 p.m., about an hour after Montclair police apprehended him near his apartment at 40 Sherman St., said Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office.A call to police reported that Kimbrough was naked, and screaming in the street. As police approached him in the vehicle, Kimbrough allegedly rammed the car twice -- once with his head -- and raised his fists to the officers, Loriquet said.

Attempts to subdue Kimbrough with pepper spray were not successful, and the man was restrained, handcuffed and taken to the hospital, where he later went into cardiac arrest.

An autopsy was to be completed today, but results were not available this evening.

Montclair Deputy Chief Perry Mayers said that Kimbrough was not in police custody when he died, but in the care of the hospital staff.

The investigation, he said, is a matter of protocol.

"Anytime we are involved in an incident resulting in serious injury or death, we are required to notify the prosecutor's office and that's what we did," Mayers said.

The Prosecutor's Office Homicide Squad and Office of Professional Standards, with the Montclair Police Department's Internal Affairs Office, is conducting the investigation.

Anyone with information about where to reach Kimbrough's next of kin is urged to contact Detective Marquise Carter of the Prosecutor's Office Homicide Squad at (973) 621-4634.
