A Jones County woman is dead tonight after apparently shooting herself in the chest following a high-speed chase and pursuit with police.

Authorities say it started about 4pm Wednesday, when the woman and her husband got into an argument at his place of business. Margaret Crocker left the business at a high rate of speed and police started following her after a 911 call.

We are told the chase ended at the intersection of Joe Wheeler and East 15th Avenue when she forced the police car off the road and both vehicles hit a fence.

Authorities say when they reached the car, the woman had fatally shot herself in the chest.

An investigation continues.
