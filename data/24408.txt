State police are investigating the arrest and tasering of a man by Carencro police officers on June 13.

The 32-year-old man, identified by his family as Nathaniel McCoy, is being taken off life support at Lafayette General.

They said he’s been unresponsive at the hospital for days.

Carencro Police Chief David Anderson told KLFY today that the circumstances surrounding McCoy’s arrest have been turned over to state troopers.

State Police Troop I spokesman Brooks David confirmed that McCoy was tasered, but said he could not release any further details on his arrest and his death at this time.
