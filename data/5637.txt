A Savannah-Chatham Metropolitan Police officer hit a pedestrian who was walking across Bay Street early Sunday morning.

Bruce Fender, 44, was attempting to cross Bay, between Jefferson and Barnard streets, when Officer Lorenzo Baker's vehicle struck the man, according to police.

Fender, a resident of Hardeeville, was rushed to Memorial Health University Medical Center just before 1 a.m. Sunday. He was listed in critical condition later in the evening.

Baker was patrolling the entertainment corridor in a marked police cruiser when Fender walked in front of the officer's car, witnesses told police.

Sgt. Mike Wilson, a police spokesman, said Fender was not walking in a designated crosswalk.

Wilson said no charges have been filed, and Baker is still on active duty as police continue investigating the circumstances.

An unrelated accident involving another police patrol car sent a woman to the hospital Saturday afternoon. Her injuries were less serious, however, according to police.

Anthony Fulton, a spokesman for Savannah-Chatham police, said Officer David Jannot was heading south on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard about 12:30 p.m. when a car made a left turn in front of his vehicle onto Hall Street.

Fulton said Jannot tried to avoid hitting the car and instead hit a parked car on the side of the road. That parked car then collided with another parked car.

Juliette Smith, 47, was attempting to get into the second parked vehicle. She was knocked to the ground and received minor scrapes and abrasions, Fulton said.
