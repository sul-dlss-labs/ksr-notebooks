The Tucson Police Department released the names of the officers involved in a fatal shooting Wednesday, and identified the man who was killed as Robert Lopez, 33.

Officers David Ortiz and Anthony Flores responded at 1:20 p.m. to a call about a man hiding in the backyard of a unit at St. Michael's Apartments in the 5300 block of East Ferry Drive, Sgt. Chris Widmer, a police spokesman, said in a news release.

The apartments are in central Tucson, near Freedom Park, between South Swan and South Craycroft roads.

The officers saw Lopez armed with a handgun and "crouched down inside of a makeshift doghouse just outside the back door," Widmer said. "The officers drew their service weapons and began giving verbal commands to the subject. The subject did not comply ... and began to raise the weapon towards the officers. Both officers fired their weapons and the subject was struck multiple times."

Lopez did not fire his gun, Widmer said.

Per department policy for officer-involved shootings, Ortiz, an eight-year veteran of the TPD, and Flores, who has been with the department for 12 years, were placed on administrative leave while the incident is investigated, Widmer said.
