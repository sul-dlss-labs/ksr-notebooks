The driver of a speeding Monte Carlo that nearly struck a State Police car on Niagara Falls Boulevard early this morning was killed when his car rammed the back of another vehicle at 56th Street in Niagara Falls minutes later.

State Police said that shortly before 5 a.m., their patrols monitored a radio transmission from Niagara Falls police that a vehicle was speeding eastbound on Niagara Falls Boulevard without its headlights on. Almost immediately, a State trooper had to take evasive action to avoid the Monte Carlo, which was described as an older model.

After the car failed to stop at a flashing red light at 74th Street and accelerated from the intersection at a high rate of speed, troopers began pursuing it.

After traveling another mile, the Monte Carlo rear-ended another vehicle at 56th Street.

The driver of the speeding car, Lewis R. Worrells, 30, of Niagara Falls, was taken to Erie County Medical Center, where he died of his injuries at 7:26 a.m.

The driver of the car that was struck by Worrellsâ€™ car was taken to Niagara Falls Memorial Medical Center, refused treatment and was released.

The investigation of the crash is being done by the New York State Police Collision Reconstruction Unit and the Bureau of Criminal Investigation. Police are asking anyone who witnessed any part of the incident to call State Police in Lockport at 434-5589.
