UPDATED at 12:20 with name of man killed.

A St. Charles man who called 911 early this morning insisting police show up at a Granite City gas station was fatally shot by the arriving officers who say the man pointed a gun at them.

"The individual calling was obviously distraught and requested police for an unknown reason," said Master Sgt. Mark Doiron with the Illinois State Police.

Police arrived at the Phillips 66 station, at 3215 Edwardsville Road, shortly after the 4:12 a.m. emergency call came in. Two officers found Stephen S. Minch, 45, sitting in his vehicle, parked behind the station.

"They pulled up not really knowing what they had, and one of the officers saw that the suspect had a pistol," said Doiron. "They ordered him to drop it several times and he began raising it in the direction of the officers."

Concerned for their safety, the officers shot Minch multiple times and he died at the scene, Doiron said. The officers were not injured, and the gas station was not open at the time.

Illinois State Police took over the investigation since the shootings involved two officers with Granite City Police, the agency that first responded.

Doiron said it is unknown why Minch was in Granite City and police continue talking with family and friends to learn more.
