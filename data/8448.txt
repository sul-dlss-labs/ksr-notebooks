Leopoldo Huizar, a 24-year-old Latino, died Sunday, Sept. 20, after he was shot by a Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputy in the 11600 block of East Imperial Highway in Norwalk, authorities said.

A deputy was patrolling the area around the Towne House Motel when he "encountered a suspicious male" in the back parking lot, according to a statement from the Sheriff's Department.

Huizar was belligerent, authorities said, and resisted the deputy while he tried to check him for weapons. According to the statement, the deputy shot Huizar after he allegedly pulled a gun out of his waistband.

Huizar was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 9:36 p.m., said Ed Winter, a spokesman for the county coroner's office. A loaded handgun was recovered from the scene, authorities said.
