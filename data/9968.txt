UPDATE: Jeffrey Douglas Filipponi, 32, of Santa Margarita died earlier today when he crashed his Acura while fleeing from police on the ramp from Highway 101 to Highway 58.

Original story: A high speed chase that started in Pismo Beach ended in a fatal crash in Santa Margarita Thursday morning at about 4 a.m.

A Pismo Beach Police officer conducting a traffic stop for a felony vehicle violation was approaching a white Acura when the driver sped away. The Pismo Beach officer and a Grover Beach Police unit followed the suspect north on Highway 101.

Fleeing at speeds in excess of 100 miles an hour, the male driver exited the highway in San Luis Obispo, dropped off a passenger and headed back to the freeway with officers in pursuit.

While attempting to take the Santa Margarita exit, the suspect left the road near the end of the exit and crashed. The unnamed driver was pronounced dead at the scene.
