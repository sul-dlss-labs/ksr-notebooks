A Miami police officer shot and killed a man last night in the fourth deadly police-involved shooting in the past month in Miami-Dade County.

The latest shooting happened just before 7 p.m. as officers were responding to a reported assault at a home near 30th Street and Northwest 1st Avenue.

Police said they arrived at the scene to find Celso Marrero Rebuelta, 51, with two knives in his hands. Rebuelta ignored police commands to drop the knives, then became aggressive with the responding officers, forcing them to shoot, according to police.

Rebuelta died a short time later at Jackson Memorial Hospital.

The shooting comes just weeks after Miami Beach Officer Adam Tavss was involved in two shootings just four days apart. The first was June 14, when Tavss shot Virginia tourist Husien Shehada outside a club after an early morning confrontation. Four days later, and hours after he returned to duty, Tavss was involved in the shooting of car jacking suspect Lawrence Raymond McCoy, who led police on a wild chase on the MacArthur Causeway.

McCoy opened fire on officers, according to police. Shehada was unarmed.

Just 10 days ago, on June 27, Miami police shot and killed a man who was waving a machete at another man near the Miami-Dade County jail.

Police have placed the officer involved in the latest shooting on administrative leave as they investigate the shooting.
