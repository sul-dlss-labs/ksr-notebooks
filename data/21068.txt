A gunman who opened fire with a shotgun during a morning church service in Detroit killed a woman and wounded two people before he shot himself a mile away, police said.

Investigators believe a domestic dispute led to the shooting at Zion Hope Missionary Baptist Church, said James Tate, a deputy police chief. A 9-year-old child, sitting near the woman who was killed, was hit in the hand by a buckshot pellet, Tate said.

As the gunman fled the church, he shot a man trying to protect his wife from a carjacking attempt, officials said.

More than five hours after the shooting spree, officers spotted the suspect, Kevin Lorenzo Collins, 24, walking about a mile south of the church. Collins shot himself to death before police captured him, Tate said.
