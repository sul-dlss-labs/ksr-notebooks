Paul P.E. Bookson, a retired New York State judge and a past president of the Eldridge Street Synagogue on the Lower East Side, died last night after he was struck by a motorcycle while crossing a street in downtown Brooklyn yesterday afternoon, the authorities said.

Justice Bookson, 72, was crossing Adams Street around 12:30 p.m. when he was struck by the motorcycle, which was driven by an off-duty police officer, the police said. He suffered severe head injuries, broken legs and internal bleeding and was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center, where he died at 9:30 p.m. surrounded by his family, said Rabbi Yisrael Stone of the Eldridge Street Synagogue.

The name of the officer, who is 26, was not released yesterday, but the police said she was issued a summons for driving with a learner's permit instead of a motorcycle license.

Justice Bookson was an acting State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan before retiring in 1995, and he was still serving as a judicial hearing officer, according to David Bookstaver, a spokesman for the State Office of Court Administration. He worked at the law firm Hertzfeld & Rubin.
