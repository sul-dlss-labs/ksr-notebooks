A 27-year-old man fatally shot earlier this week after police said he threatened dogs and children with a machete in the West Lawn neighborhood was identified Thursday as a Polish national who had been in the United States for about two years.

Bogdan Fryzlewicz was shot at least seven times early Wednesday after he allegedly refused police orders to drop the 2-foot-long knife near 61st Street and Kilbourn Avenue. Exactly what Fryzlewicz was doing in the moments before his confrontation with police, however, remained unclear Thursday.

Police said he had been acting erratically, wielding a machete and a roofing hammer, and threatening a dog and two schoolchildren in the Southwest Side neighborhood.

The man's brother, however, has told Polish officials in Chicago that he understood Fryzlewicz was jogging at the time and was carrying the machete as part of his training for a self-defense program.

Alan Aleksandrowicz, assistant to the Polish consul general in Chicago, said he spoke by phone with Fryzlewicz' brother in Poland on Thursday. He relayed that his brother was a resident of a southern Polish city, near the Czech border, and had been in the United States illegally for about two years, Aleksandrowicz said.

He did not know what Fryzlewicz had done for a living, but said he apparently lived with a friend or a girlfriend.

Fryzlewicz was identified at the morgue by a friend, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Police said they received a call of a man brandishing a machete in the West Lawn neighborhood at about 7:15 a.m. Wednesday. When the officers showed up, Fryzlewicz ran into an alley and jumped into a city garbage container.

He then ran from the alley and across the street to where two young children were walking to school. Police ordered Fryzlewicz to leave the children alone, but he allegedly began walking toward the officers, ignoring orders to drop the machete.
