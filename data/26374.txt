VENTURA – An armed man's alleged threats to his wife brought out a large police response in Ventura Monday morning, authorities said.

The incident was called in around 7:50 a.m. in the 3900 block of Telegraph Road when someone reported a man threatening others with a handgun inside the residence, the Ventura Police Department reported. The man ultimately killed himself, police said.

The block is in a residential area east of the Ventura Family YMCA.

Officers learned the man had reportedly been drinking and had threatened his wife with a handgun, authorities said. The wife and a granddaughter fled the home and called police. Several weapons were inside, authorities were told.

Officers negotiated with the man, a Ventura resident, for more than an hour, telling him to disarm and leave the residence, authorities said.

The man ended the call and authorities heard several gunshots from inside the residence, according to police. The department's SWAT team was summoned and the department, through social media, urged members of the public to avoid the area.

SWAT team members entered the residence and found the man had died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound prior to their entrance, officials said.
