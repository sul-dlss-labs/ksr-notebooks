A man is dead after a rollover crash on Detroit’s west side Sunday afternoon.

Robin Hawthorne says the person killed was her 19-year-old great nephew Deontae Hawthorne.

The incident happened around 12:15 Sunday at the corner of Santa Clara and Kentucky, right off Wyoming. Police say the victim was speeding in a stolen Jeep Wrangler, and that the driver hit a parked Chevy then flipped over, being ejected from the vehicle.

Witnesses say police were chasing the Jeep but authorities are not confirming that, only saying that DPD will be launching an internal investigation.

“I want to talk with Chief Craig about the situation, it's something not right about this picture,” Robin Hawthorne said.

Police have confirmed that no one else was in the car and that no one else was hurt, but the lack of information has Robin Hawthorne angry and frustrated.

“I need you to get on this case, I need the badges, I want you to get every one of your men badges, find out what happened to my nephew.

Preliminary information from this incident indicated that this was not a high speed chase, but an internal investigation will be launched with Detroit Police.
