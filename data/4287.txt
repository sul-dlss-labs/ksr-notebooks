DES MOINES (AP) - A grand jury on Thursday cleared a sheriff's deputy who shot and killed a man brandishing a toy gun outside the Polk County Courthouse last month.

Deputy Keith Onley, an eight-year veteran, shot Jonathan McCourt, 47, of Pleasant Hill, once in the chest as McCourt reached for the toy.

McCourt had been standing stop his pickup, freshly spray-painted with the words "Police Academy 7," and shouting profanities.

McCourt's family said he was mentally ill and had not been taking his medication. He had been hospitalized twice in the previous 18 months.

Family members questioned whether the danger was enough to justify the use of lethal force.

Onley was placed on routine administrative leave following the shooting. The case was reviewed by a grand jury, as is typical in police shootings, to determine whether criminal charges were warranted.

Polk County Chief Deputy Bill Vaughn said in a statement that the jury verdict will likely be argued by those who do not understand the difficulty officers face when confronted by a weapons that are fake but appear to be real.

"Deputy Onley, we believed, acted appropriately in his actions and was in fear of his life, the lives of his fellow officers as well as the citizens within the immediate area," Dykstra said.

Authorities, for the first time since the June 7 shooting, displayed the gun, which appeared at close inspection to be a plastic silver-colored pistol with a pink handle.
