A Milwaukee police officer is on administrative leave after he shot and killed a man.



It happened at about 2 a.m. Sunday near 5th Street and North Avenue.



According to Milwaukee police, two officers were on routine patrol. They saw a vehicle stopped on Sixth Street facing south and a man was in the road talking with a person in the car. Police said they thought it might be a drug transaction.



When the car pulled away, the officers approached Robert M. Agnew. They asked him to stop, but he declined, pulled a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at the officers, according to police.



That is when Officer Jake Knight shot and killed Agnew.



Neighbors said they weren't surprised to hear gunshots.



"My nephew is 3. We even taught him how to duck. Just lay on the floor if you hear gunshots. I have a 4-year-old niece. We told her if you hear shots, you just lay down and duck. She's terrified," neighbor Denise Morris said.



Knight, 24, said he was concerned for the safety of himself and his partner. He has been on the force nearly four years.



Police said Monday that Agnew's gun was reported stolen from another state.





A happy ending. Dead scumbag and recovered stolen gun. Good job Officer Knight.
