A suspected burglar was fleeing police when he drowned in a Boiling Springs pond.

James Edward Harris cut a hole in a fence at a small engine repair shop early Thursday, triggering an alarm. When police responded soon after, they tracked the 40-year-old man into the woods behind the business.

Spartanburg County Sheriff Chuck Wright says Harris got into the water and began to swim but was struggling. A deputy swam after the suspect before he lost sight of Harris.

Harris' body was later recovered in the pond by divers.

Surveillance footage showed Harris going into the business' fenced area, but he apparently never went into the building.
