Prosecutors declined to file charges against a San Bernardino police officer who shot and killed a 20-year-old man in April.

Officer Juan Ochoa shot Juan Carlos Gravina because the man reached in his waistband and then Ochoa thought he saw Gravina pointing a gun at him, the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s Office wrote in a report.

“Officer Ochoa was in fear of his life at the time he shot the subject in what appeared to be the subject raising a gun at the officer,” prosecutors wrote in the report.

The incident occurred April 15 near the corner of Sierra Way and Seventh Street. Ochoa said Gravina reached in his waistband when Ochoa and another officer stopped and got out of their patrol car.

Gravina ran from officers, keeping both of his hands in front of his waistband. He stopped during the chase, and held up an item that officers thought was a gun. Ochoa fired once at Gravina. Gravina continued pointing the item at the officer, so Ochoa fired a second shot, prosecutors said.

Gravina ran into a front yard and then a garage. He dropped a 9mm magazine and a 9mm cartridge while fleeing, but police did not find a gun. Gravina died at the scene.
