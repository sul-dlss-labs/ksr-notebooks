GULFPORT, Mississippi -- Gulfport police officers Michael Hauler and Benjamin Bentz have been cleared of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of Gulfport resident Frank James Rhodes in June.

A Harrison County Grand Jury reviewed the findings of a Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and Biloxi Police Department investigation and declined to indict either of the officers.

According to Gulfport Police Chief Leonard Papania, the two officers responded to a call on June 13 at 10:13 p.m. of an intoxicated male in a garage on Holliman Circle. Police were told the man -- later identified as the 61-year-old Rhodes -- had a gun and had fired it.

Upon arrival, Hauler and Benjamin approached the residence. At that point, Rhodes -- standing in the driveway -- raised a handgun and fired at one of the officers. The officers returned fire, striking Rhodes four times, once in the head, according to an autopsy later performed by Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove.

Rhodes died at the scene.

Following protocol, the MBI and Biloxi Police Department Crime Scene Unit were called to the scene to conduct an independent investigation.

"It is an unfortunate reality that our police officers sometimes encounter the violence that they do," Papania said in a statement. "This was the first of two incidences in six months where shot at while protecting our city.

"One of our officers remains away from duty because of gunshot wounds due to being a victim of attempted murder," Papania also said, referring to patrolman Dolton Bradley, who was shot and seriously wounded while on duty in November.

Papania also said that WLOX-TV had requested the race of the two officers involved. Hauler and Bentz are white, he said. Rhodes was black.
