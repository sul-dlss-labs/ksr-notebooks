A Tuesday-night callout to a disturbance in St. Augustine left a 28-year-old man dead after an officer-involved shooting at a condominium in the 1500 block of Masters Drive, the St. Johns County Sheriff's Office said.

Identified as Dustin James Acosta, he was shot when he came to the door with a handgun, and a St. Augustine police officer and a St. Johns County deputy fired, officials said.

The confrontation began just after 9 p.m. as Sgt. Kevin Carroll was called to the condominium, joined by Deputy Kristapher James, on patrol in the area, the Sheriff's Office said. The responding officers had been told that a man was possibly intoxicated and trying to drive away, and others there were attempting to stop him. Officers were also told it had become physical and Acosta armed himself at the condominium just west of the San Sebastian River.

When the sergeant and deputy went to the home, the door opened to reveal the man with weapon drawn, Sheriff's Office spokesman Chuck Mulligan said.

"The individual was a short distance away and had a firearm in his hand, acting in a despondent manner," Mulligan said. "They tried to convince him to de-escalate the situation. They were looking to do that when the individual turned the firearm and pointed it at the officer and deputy."

Carroll and James both fired at the man, who was killed at the scene. No other injuries were reported, Mulligan said. This is the first officer-involved shooting event for both.

Acosta has a lengthy arrest record dating back to 2010 in St. Johns County on charges ranging from marijuana possession and trespassing to disorderly conduct just over a year ago, according to jail records that also list his address on Masters Drive.

The Sheriff's Office's major crimes unit and others are investigating the shooting.
