The man shot and killed by a Clearwater police officer Saturday has been identified as 69-year-old David Rocco Diroma.

Police were called to 3018 Merrill Ave. at 4:21 p.m. Saturday after a friend became concerned about statements Diroma made about having no reason to live.

When police arrived on the scene just north of the Eddie C. Moore softball complex, they tried to establish communication with Diroma by cell phone and home phone. They also used a loudspeaker on a patrol car, but Diroma didn't respond, police said.

Police said Diroma, whom they had seen walking around inside the house, came outside armed with a handgun. When he refused to drop the weapon and aimed it at officers in a threatening manner, they said, an officer hit him with a single shot.

Diroma was taken to Mease Countryside Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 6:30 p.m.

A friend of Diroma's said he lived a lonely and stressful life and was most likely desperate after he separated with his wife.



Officer Brian Rogers, who fired the shot, was not injured in the incident. He was placed on paid administrative leave, which is routine in police-involved shootings.

Rogers has been with the department for more than 12 years.
