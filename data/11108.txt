The mother of a man shot to death by Riverside police in 2012 has filed a

federal lawsuit against the city, alleging that officers shot Brandon James

Dunbar in the back, allowed him to bleed to death and hid evidence.

Dunbar, 26, was killed about 2:30 a.m. March 1, 2012, while fleeing police.

As he ran into a backyard near Anna Street and Lincoln Avenue, he turned toward

officers while holding a gun, the Police Department said at the time. Dunbar

died at a hospital.

The wrongful-death lawsuit, filed May 7 in U.S. District Court in the Central

District of California, said Dunbar is developmentally disabled but did not

elaborate or say how it was relevant to the incident. Gary S. Casselman, of

Casselman Law Offices in Los Angeles, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of

Ulrike Dunbar, could not immediately be reached for comment.

Dunbar was a passenger in a vehicle that was pulled over, the lawsuit said,

for having an obscured license plate. The lawsuit said Dunbar was shot several

times “from a position where deadly force was not justified in self-defense or

defense of others.”

One of his major leg arteries was severed, and he began bleeding heavily, the

lawsuit says. His life could have been saved, Dunbar’s attorney wrote, but

police failed to apply a tourniquet.

Furthermore, “all defendants conspired to remove as much physical evidence as

possible … by excavating the entire area where decedent had bled to death,

removing the blood-sodden turf and dirt to an undisclosed location,” the lawsuit

says.

The lawsuit asks for unspecified monetary damages.

City Attorney Greg Priamos said his office investigated the allegations and

concluded that they are without merit.

“We fully intend to represent the interests of the city, its Police

Department and the involved officers,” Priamos said in a telephone interview

Monday, June 3.
