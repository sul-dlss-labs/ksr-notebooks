A man who barricaded himself from deputies in his vehicle for several hours in Lomita died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, authorities said Wednesday.

After several hours and verbal attempts by Crisis Negotiation Team members to get the suspect to surrender, the man shot himself at about 11 p.m., Deputy Trina Schrader of the Los Angeles County sheriff’s Information Bureau said.

The man, who has not been identified, was transported to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

About 4 p.m. Tuesday, deputies with the Lomita sheriff’s station responded to a call for service from a woman who said she had a restraining order against a man sitting in a vehicle in her driveway.

When deputies arrived, they found the man driving away from the location, Schrader said. The suspect drove to his residence on the 24600 block of Cypress Street and remained in his vehicle.

Deputies tried to contact the man, but he flashed a gun. The deputies took cover and called the department’s Special Enforcement Bureau and crisis negotiation team to assist.

Two firearms were recovered from inside the vehicle after the incident, Schraeder said.

No deputies were injured and residents, who were evacuated during the incident, were allowed to return to their homes, Schrader said.
