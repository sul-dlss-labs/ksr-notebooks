A motorcyclist died Tuesday in a crash while trying to outrun police in a high-speed chase, authorities said.

Police attempted to pull over the motorcycle driver around 12:45 a.m. near Milliken Avenue and 7th Street in Rancho Cucamonga after noticing the bike did not have a license plate.

The driver fled officers and a pursuit began, reaching speeds of 110 miles an hour through city streets, according to officials. The chase was eventually called off due to the high speeds.

Moments later, the motorcycle crashed into a white Toyota Corolla on Milliken Avenue at the 10 Freeway on and off ramps in Ontario. Authorities said the Corolla appears to have been exiting the freeway on the off ramp when the motorcycle struck the vehicle.

The driver of the Corolla was not hurt. The rider of the motorcycle was thrown from the bike and pronounced dead, police said.

Ontario Police accident investigation responded to the scene. Southbound lanes of Milliken Avenue were closed during the investigation, as well as the ramps to the 10 Freeway.
