Des Moines police reported the discovery of the body of an unidentified man in the Des Moines River near Riverview Park on Saturday afternoon.

Des Moines police spokesperson Sgt. Paul Parizek said a fisherman spotted the body in the water and that a cyclist riding on a riverside bike trail who happened on the scene moments later called police around 4:40 p.m.

The body was found in the portion of the Des Moines River west of the intersection of 6th Avenue and New York Avenue.

Parizek said the Polk County medical examiner will seek to identify the man and the cause of his death. He added that there is a "strong possibility" the body may be that of an individual who jumped into the river at Prospect Park on March 17.

Parizek said police were at the park, just upriver from Riverview Park, that evening on an unrelated matter when a man began yelling at officers, hopped in a vehicle, and drove through the park "erratically." When police followed him, Parizek said, the man got out of the car and jumped into the river.

He said police called in the Des Moines Fire Department Water Emergency Team to search for the man, but did not find him. Further unsuccessful searches took place on March 18 and 25, he said.

Des Moines police are investigating the potential connection.
