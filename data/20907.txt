PORTAGE, MI - A woman who was killed early Friday during a police pursuit in Portage has been identified by police as Juanita Lee, of Kalamazoo.

Lee, 50, died in a crash that occurred after she fled from a Kalamazoo County sheriff's deputy on South Westnedge Avenue near Milham Road.

Investigators said the deputy stopped Lee for speeding at 3:08 a.m. and she pulled her car into a commercial parking lot and exited her vehicle. The deputy ordered Lee back into her car and she complied.

Police said she then drove away at a high rate of speed, drove over a curb and headed south on Westnedge.

The deputy attempted to pursue Lee, but lost sight of her car on Westnedge near Romence Road, according to a news release issued by the sheriff's office Friday morning.

The deputy later found Lee's car crashed on Westnedge near Shaver Road, across the street from the Portage Department of Public Safety.

Michigan State Police, who are investigating the fatal crash, said Lee's car jumped a curb and crashed into the railroad tracks on the east side of Westnedge before rolling multiple times. Lee, who was ejected from the vehicle, died at the scene, according to a news release issued by MSP.

State police said Lee was not wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash and "it is unknown if alcohol is a factor in this event."

State Police said they responded to the scene of the crash at about 3:10 a.m. to investigate and determined that the crash had occurred after the deputy "attempted to stop a vehicle regarding a BOL (Be On the Lookout) in the area."

Police shut down Westnedge between Schuring Road and Shaver Road for more almost two hours Friday morning following the crash.
