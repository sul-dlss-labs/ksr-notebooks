A Friday morning police chase in western Wisconsin ended with a rollover crash that ejected and killed the driver and sent two passengers to the hospital.

A Polk County sheriff’s deputy was patrolling the village of Luck about 2:40 a.m. Friday when he saw a vehicle drive off the road near Main Street and East Butternut Avenue. When the deputy turned on his cruiser’s emergency lights, the vehicle fled and the deputy and a Luck police officer pursued.

The fleeing vehicle sped south of town on 150th Street before leaving the roadway near Wisconsin 46, rolling over and ejecting the driver, according to a news release from the Polk County sheriff’s office.

The driver, whose name has not been released pending notification of family, was not wearing a seat belt and was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash. Two passengers were taken to the St. Croix Falls hospital with injuries that weren’t considered life-threatening.

The sheriff’s office has requested an independent investigation by the Wisconsin State Patrol and the St. Croix County sheriff’s office.
