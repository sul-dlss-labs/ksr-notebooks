The Warren County prosecutor has cleared officers in the April fatal shooting of Warren Gary Cook in a two-hour standoff in South Lebanon.

"Their use of deadly force was in response to the actions of Cook which placed these officers, and others in immediate danger of death or serious physical harm," Prosecutor David Fornshell wrote in a press release issued Monday.

Three officers with the Warren County Tactical Response Unit opened fire on Cook after he made threatening statements toward the officers and raised his shotgun in a firing stance, Fornshell said. Cook was shot twice and died at the scene.

Officers had gone to the home in the 4800 block of Lebanon Road at 5:30 p.m. on April 21 to serve Cook with a civil protection order that was obtained by family members.

Cook put on a bullet-proof vest, grabbed a shotgun and began making threats at the officers, Fornshell said. The tactical team was called in to help rescue the officers.

After the shooting, police found Cook's shotgun with one round in the chamber and one round in the magazine. An autopsy report indicated that Cook's blood-alcohol level was at .257, more than three times the legal limit for driving. Fornshell said Cook also was taking anti-depressants and had morphine and oxycodone in his system.
