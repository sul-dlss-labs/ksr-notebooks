A 33-year-old Greenwood man died after a motorcycle crash in Bridgeville Sunday morning after allegedly refusing to stop for a local police officer.

Melvin O. DeShields, who was operating a 2012 Yamaha R6L, allegedly refused to stop and accelerated after a Bridgeville patrol officer tried to stop him for a traffic violation on northbound U.S. Route 13 around 2:20 a.m. on June 8, according to Delaware State Police spokesman Sgt. Paul G. Shavack.

Shavack said the Bridgeville officer activated his lights after observing DeShields driving above the posted speed limit.

DeShields, who was allegedly driving at a high rate of speed, turned eastbound onto Redden Road and continued until he was unable to handle a moderate curve in the road, traveled off the south edge of the roadway and crashed into a bridge guardrail, Shavack said. DeShields was thrown from the motorcycle onto the roadway. Shavack said a preliminary investigation indicated that DeShields was not wearing a helmet.

DeShields sustained multiple traumatic injuries and was taken to Nanticoke Memorial Hospital, then to the Christian Hospital Trauma Center where he was pronounced dead.

Shavack said Redden Road was closed for about three hours while the crash was investigated and cleared. The Delaware State Police Collision Reconstruction Unit is continuing its investigation, and any questions about the incident can be directed to the Bridgeville Police Department at (302) 337-8302.
