El Paso police identified the man shot and killed by two police officers Thursday morning in Northeast El Paso as David Alejandro Gandara, 22.

Gandara, of the 10100 block of Whitetail Drive, was shot and killed at about 8:15 a.m. after he tried to enter Kids Campus and Daycare at the Rushfair Pointe shopping center, 5111 Fairbanks, police said.

Officers were responding to a call of a suicidal man with a gun, police said. The officers found Gandara in an alley behind the day care center.

Gandara allegedly ignored the officers orders and "attempted to retrieve a firearm," police said. The two officers, whose names have not been released, shot Gandara.

He died at the scene.

According to court records, a man with the same name, age and who lives in the same area has been arrested several times including twice for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and once each for burglary of a vehicle and arson.

One of the officers involved in the shooting has been with the department six years and the other officer has been on the force for five months, police said.

No further details have been released.

According to police, there are investigations by the department's Crimes Against Persons unit, the department's Shooting Review Team and Texas Rangers.

After the investigations are completed, the case will be sent to the El Paso County District Attorney's Office, which then presents the case to a grand jury, police said. The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigations.

According to the El Paso Times archives, this is the 22nd shooting involving El Paso police officers, including one by an off-duty officer, since 2007. Eighteen people were killed in the shootings.
