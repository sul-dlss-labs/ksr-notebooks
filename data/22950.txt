NORTON SHORES, Mich. — A shoplifting and stolen car complaint led to a deadly crash Thursday in Norton Shores. Police say an innocent driver was killed just moments after a chase with the suspect was called off.

Officials with Engine Power Components, Inc. in Grand Haven tell FOX 17 World War II Infantry Veteran Duane Levi Quigg, who just celebrated 92nd birthday in June and started the company, was tragically killed Thursday. Quigg was driving with his girlfriend who is hospitalized and seriously hurt.

The crash happened just after 11:30 a.m. at Broadway Avenue and Huizenga Street. Norton Shores Police Chief Jon Gale says the shoplifting suspect driving the stolen car crashed into an SUV driven by Quigg.

The suspect was also hospitalized with serious injuries.

The police pursuit started less than two miles from the crash scene when an officer pulled the suspect over at Getty Street near Airline Road. As the officer got out of his vehicle Gale says the suspect sped off. Officers were responding to a shoplifting complaint at the Meijer store on Henry Street and then learned the suspect vehicle was stolen.

“It’s very tragic event,” said Chief Gale.

“This person that fled from the officer and stole a car at some point and was involved in some crime, retail fraud crimes, placed this neighborhood in jeopardy.”

According to Chief Gale, the chase was called off due to the high rate of speed and weather. Michigan State Police were also on scene and the crash is under investigation.
