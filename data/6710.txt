Southern California law enforcement agencies failed to report 66 fatal police shootings to state authorities from 2007 through 2011, the latest year available. The name of each agency involved in the shooting, the name of the person killed and the date follow. Agencies aren’t necessarily required to report their own shootings under California law, and officials sometimes debate responsibility for reporting.
