Coroner IDs man killed in shootout with Metro Police

A man shot and killed after exchanging gunfire with Metro Police was identified today as Herbert Earl Green, 46, of Henderson, officials with the Clark County Coroner’s Office said.

Green initially called Metro about 2 p.m. on Tuesday with a prophetic message: He said he would be killed that day, according to police. When officers arrived at the house in the 5400 block of Palm Street, Green walked in and out several times speaking with the officers, officials said.

The last time he came out of the house, he had a handgun and began firing at officers, police said. Officers returned fire, shooting Green multiple times.

Green was transported to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center, where he died from multiple gunshot wounds, Coroner’s Office officials said.

One officer was injured in the incident, but not from the shooting, police said. No additional details were released about the injury.

The names of the officers involved in the shooting have not yet been released.
