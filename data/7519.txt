Two state police tactical officers were wounded and a suspect is dead after a shootout about 7:15 a.m. Thursday at home off Falcon Road in rural Williamson County near Crab Orchard Lake.

Illinois State Police Lt. Scott Compton said officers of the State Police Tactical Response Team and the Southern Illinois Enforcement Group were executing a drug search warrant issued through the Williamson County state's attorney's office.

Police said they arrived at the residence of William A. Patrich, 61, whose address is listed as 265 Falcon Road.

As the officers announced themselves and approached the home, Patrich opened fire, Compton said.

Compton said police officers returned fire, and Patrich was fatally wounded. He estimated the entire shootout lasted less than a minute.

"Again, two of our officers were struck, one of them in the head," Compton said.

The officers were in stable condition at Memorial Hospital of Carbondale. They are expected to recover, he said. The officers were wearing protective equipment, including helmets.

There was no one home besides Patrich, police said.

Compton said police regret that "Mr. Patrich made the decision to confront our officers with deadly force," and law enforcement officials recognize that the loss of any life is difficult.

However, Compton said, police officers with families go to work each day understanding the dangers of their jobs.

"Today, these officers were faced with the nec-essity to protect themselves and each other," he said.

The lieutenant said, "Our thoughts and prayers are with the wounded officers and their families."

The shooting will be investigated by the Illinois State Police Division of Internal Investigation.
