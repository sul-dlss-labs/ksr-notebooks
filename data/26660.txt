A woman was killed on Wednesday after getting run over by a car driven by two suspects that had just robbed her.

The incident occurred at a shopping center at Brookhurst Boulevard and Westminster Avenue.

Detectives were conducting surveillance on individuals suspected to be involved in robberies shortly before 9:30 a.m. in the 13900 block of Brookhurst Street, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office.

During the surveillance, the suspect drove into the parking lot of the shopping center and tried stealing the woman's purse. The victim, a 32-year-old woman from Westminster, fought the robbers but was run over by them before fleeing north on Brookhurst towards the 22 freeway, law enforcement officials said.

The woman was taken to the hospital where she later died. Her name has not yet been released.

The suspects led police on a chase from Orange County that ended in Los Angeles. When the suspects bailed from their vehicle near Century Boulevard, all three were taken into custody. Their identities have not been released.

Anyone with any information on this case is asked to call the Garden Grove Police Department Crimes Against Persons unit at 714-741-5839.
