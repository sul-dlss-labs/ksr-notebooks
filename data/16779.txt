A U.S. Customs and Border Protection officer fatally shot her boyfriend in their Chula Vista apartment Saturday, telling police that it was in self-defense as he was hitting her, authorities said.

Melissa Hayes-Spencer, 30, voluntarily went to the Chula Vista police headquarters for further questioning. She was later booked into jail on a charge of murder, Chula Vista police said.

She called 911 about 8:45 a.m. saying sheâ€™d just shot her boyfriend and needed medical assistance, said police Lt. Fritz Reber.

Police arrived at the Pinnacle at Otay Ranch apartment complex on Santa Rita Drive off Palomar Street and found the 30-year-old man on the bedroom floor with a gunshot wound to his chest, Reber said. Hayes-Spencer was with him rendering aid.

Paramedics declared him dead at 9:16 a.m. His name has not been released.

Hayes-Spencer told police that she shot him as he was hitting her, Reber said. She appeared to have a hand injury.

Police said the couple moved into the ground-floor apartment about a month ago. No one else was in the apartment at the time of the incident except for their dog, which was unharmed and turned over to family, police said. A gun was found in the bedroom.

Investigators were also looking into whether there have been any previous reports of domestic violence or disturbances between the couple.

On her LinkedIn social media page, Hayes-Spencer says she has been with Customs and Border Protection since 2006 and is managing partner of QuickTime Property Investors, a real estate investment company. She says she attended San Diego State University from 2003 to 2007 and studied criminal justice administration.

Police are also coordinating with internal affairs investigators from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
