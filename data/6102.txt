An Atlantic County grand jury has determined that a police officer was justified in shooting a bank robbery suspect in April, according to The Press of Atlantic City.

Hamilton Township Officer Leo Rudolph gunned down Hay Nhat Duong, 25, after the suspect came toward the officer and made a motion as if to reach for a gun after several warnings to drop to the ground. Duong had no weapon.

According to the Atlantic County Prosecutor's Office, the confrontation leading up to the shooting was all recorded on Rudolph's cell phone.
