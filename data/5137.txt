The suspects demanded money and valuables. Police were called and, soon after, Officer Green arrived at the front of the store. Officer Green saw one of the armed suspects leaving the store and ordered the suspect to drop his gun. However, the suspect opened fire at Officer Green, who then returned fire with a shotgun. At least one pellet struck the suspect. Two other suspects fled out the back door of the store and have not been identified or arrested at this time.
