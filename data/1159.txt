The companion of a missing Castaic woman shot himself to death Wednesday after Los Angeles police officers knocked on the door of his Canoga Park motel room, authorities said.

David Chen, 55, of Castaic was driving a teal Ford Thunderbird registered to his live-in companion, Gloria “Chris” Cole, 59, who was last seen Aug. 2, authorities said.

About 9 a.m. Wednesday, police officers spotted the car parked at a Super 8 Motel, said Sgt. Delores Scott of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Missing Persons Division.

The motel manager directed the officers to Chen’s room, police said.

The officers knocked on the door and identified themselves, then heard a single gunshot, said LAPD spokesman Sgt. John Pasquariello. They forced the door open and found Chen on the bed with a head wound, Pasquariello said.

A sheriff’s spokeswoman said deputies had wanted to question Chen, but he was not considered a suspect in Cole’s disappearance.

Cole was last seen boarding a Castaic-bound bus in downtown Los Angeles. She is described as white, 5 feet 4 and weighing 110 pounds. She has hazel eyes and a scar on her neck, and dyed her hair blond, authorities said.

A $20,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to Cole’s return. Anyone with information is asked to call (323) 890-5500.
