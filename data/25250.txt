COLUMBUS, Miss. â€” Mississippi authorities say a 22-year-old man died when his car hit a tree after a brief police chase. News outlets identify him as Brandon Perry of Columbus.

Starkville police say the chase began when a car drove through a Mississippi Highway Patrol checkpoint late Saturday.

A Starkville Police Department news release says the officer chasing Perry soon turned off his blue lights because of safety concerns, briefly lost sight of the car and then saw it stopped, off the road.

A Mississippi Highway Patrol statement said Perry's car went off of the north side of State Highway 12, veered back across the highway and hit a tree.

Oktibbeha County Coroner Michael Hunt says Perry was not wearing a seatbelt and was pronounced dead at the scene.
