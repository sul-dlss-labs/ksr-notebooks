A man who was sought for the murder of a South Pittsburg man was shot and killed in Walker County Friday morning.

A special operations team was trying to take 54-year-old James Faulkner into custody.

Officials said Faulkner shot a deputy, but he was saved by his Kevlar combat helmet. He was shot in the forehead right above the eyes.

Eight officers had entered a doublewide mobile home on Highway 337 south of LaFayette about 3:30 a.m. The location is next to the Roper Corporation plant.

Sheriff Steve Wilson said officers had been advised that Faulkner would likely resist. He said Faulkner began firing as the officers entered.

The officers were serving a warrant issued out of Cherokee County, Ala. The body of James "Stinker" Crouch was found there by loggers last month.

The victim had been shot in the back of the head. His body was dumped in the wooded area.

Crouch was last seen June 14 at Sidewinders lounge in Lookout Valley. His car was found at the lounge.
