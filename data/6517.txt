We first reported on 9News at Noon that police did not know why their robbery suspect suddenly died after he was arrested. Well the autopsy report is back.

The coroner says a heart attack is what killed 38-year-old Abraham Payton. Police arrested Payton Wednesday after he was accused of robbing Shedrick Lobrano on Ozark St. Lobrano says Payton snatched his necklace while they were talking. The two began to fight and police were called to the scene.

Officers noticed Payton was bleeding from his ear and had him transported to Earl K. Long Hospital where he died.

Lobrano was later arrested and booked for Battery on a Police Officer and Resisting an Officer after he fought police as they were trying to handcuff him.
