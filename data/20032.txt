Authorities have identified the man found dead Tuesday in Bethlehem, following a standoff that began with an attempt to kill his girlfriend.

Gordon Debarros, 65, was pronounced dead inside the apartment he and the woman shared in the 1500 block of Geraldine Street in the city, according to Northampton County Coroner Zachary Lysek.

The woman, whom authorities did not immediately identify, was rushed to surgery at St. Luke's University Hospital in Fountain Hill, city police Chief Mark DiLuzio had said. She suffered serious stabbing and slashing wounds to her face, neck and arm and was listed in stable condition Tuesday evening, police said.

Debarros died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, said Lysek, who ruled the death a suicide.

Beginning shortly after noon Tuesday, the incident lasted about three hours, during which time a dozen neighbors were forced from their homes. Staff at two nearby elementary schools were notified of the situation, as well.

Police tried to communicate with Debarros before entering the second-floor apartment about 3:15 p.m. and finding him dead with a firearm nearby, DiLuzio had said.
