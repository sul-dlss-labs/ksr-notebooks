Three Columbia County deputies involved in a fatal shooting Thursday have been cleared by the District Attorney's office.

In a letter to Columbia County Sheriff Clay Whittle, District Attorney Natalie Paine said she reviewed the case and concluded Ronald Audette, 61, presented "a direct threat to law enforcement personnel on the scene" after he ignored commands to drop his weapon and raised it at deputies.

"Statements from witnesses establish that Mr. Audette was suicidal and had been planning his demise for several days, specifically by means of engaging police," the letter reads.

Paine states that deputies Benjamin Fowler, Michael Santana, and Ryan King were lawfully carrying out their official duties while investigating multiple reports of Audette planning to harm himself and others. She said Audette's actions prompted deputies to a justified use of deadly force.

The case will not be presented to a grand jury and the file is closed.

Deputies responded to the 5000 block of Broad Oak Drive in Grovetown after a concerned citizen contacted dispatch saying Audette was making disturbing comments and was planning a mass shooting. Audette spoke on the phone with deputies but refused to come out of his home and hung up.

He came out of the residence with a revolver in hand. Audette didn't acknowledge multiple commands by deputies and continued walking towards an open field before raising his gun. He was shot several times in his arm and torso.

Audette was taken to Doctors Hospital where he died in surgery.

The three deputies were on paid leave during the investigation.
