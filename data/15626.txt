AURORA, Colo. (AP) - Authorities have released the name of an armed robbery suspect who was shot and killed by Aurora police after officers say he refused their commands following a high-speed chase.

Police identified the suspect Wednesday as 39-year-old Kavonda Earl Payton.

Officers were called to the convenience store robbery the night of Jan. 15 and spotted a car speeding away from the scene with its lights off. They pursued the vehicle for several miles, ending the chase with a maneuver that spun the car to a stop. The driver then ran from the car with a handgun.

Investigators say Payton was shot after he showed the gun and refused to follow the officers' orders.

A second suspect in the car, 30-year-old Antione Calvin Spencer, was arrested and charged with aggravated robbery.
