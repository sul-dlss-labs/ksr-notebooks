Camille and Katrina Were not Ladies

Welcome to my Site! I have been blogging about Katrina since November 2005. I returned to my hometown in Pascagoula, Mississippi May 2003 approximately 3 1/2 yrs. after the loss of my husband. I sold my home in Gulfport in 2002 and went home to my main residence in Lumberton with the intention of staying .. instead I prepared that home to sell too. On arrival in Pascagoula, I resided with my daughter and son-in-law for 2 yrs. before moving into my present home in Moss Point. One might say I was "hop-scotching" from one place to another. On August 29. 05, I stayed with the daughter and family and was to experience the most unbelievable happenings of a hurricane gone wild. Looking back, I am glad I was with them .. I would do it again. Because of the poor media coverage that Mississippi received, I began to blog and eventually started posting news and taking pictures of damage or new construction. In some peculiar way, my "hopping" around put me, as far as a home goes, out of harms way. The two homes I sold were both damaged from the hurricane but my present one survived. So ... if you should be lead to my site through a search engine .. please read as I talk about Katrina and the aftermath. Email Me ... zeldonia@cableone.net
