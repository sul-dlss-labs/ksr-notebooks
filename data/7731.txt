For the second time in the past year, La Habra police have been in the spotlight because of an officer involved shooting. This time an armed 70-year-old woman is dead. She was shot after officer reportedly feared for their safety.

Here’s the latest information on the incident:

LA HABRA – A 70-year-old woman was shot and killed by officers in front of her home Monday night when she allegedly leveled a gun at them.

Jerry Nadine Lunceford died in her driveway on Chestnut Street after the confrontation with Orange County Sheriff’s deputies and La Habra police officers. The officers went to the home in response to a 9-1-1 call about a suicidal woman around 10:15 p.m.

Assistant Sheriff Michael Hillmann said the deputies and officers feared for their safety.

“The deputies and officers were in a very frustrating situation created by the subject,” Hillmann said Tuesday morning.

According to Hillmann, officers and deputies surrounded Lunceford’s home when they arrived at the scene. Lunceford came out of the house alone, holding a gun. Police asked her to drop the weapon, but she refused, pointing it at them.

That’s when three deputies – one of them using rubber bullets – and two La Habra police officers fired.

Hillmann said he did not know how many shots were fired, or if Lunceford’s gun was loaded.
