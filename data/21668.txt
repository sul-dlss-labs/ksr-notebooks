Jerauld Phillip Hammond II, a 46-year-old white man, was fatally shot by Los Angeles police on Thursday, July 27, in the 1700 block of Whitley Avenue in Hollywood, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 11 a.m., officers from the LAPD’s Hollywood Division responded to a call about a man with a gun at a Motel 6, police said.

The officers went to the motel’s second floor and knocked on the door, asking Hammond to come out.

After about 10 minutes, Hammond opened the door, pointed a handgun in the officer’s direction “and an officer-involved shooting occurred,” the news release said.

Hammond, who had been struck by gunfire, closed the door and barricaded himself inside.

Officers called for backup, and a SWAT team arrived, Sgt. Barry Montgomery told reporters at the scene.

SWAT officers made several attempts to contact the man, without success, he said.

About 3 p.m., police sent a robot to look inside the room and realized the man was unresponsive, Montgomery said. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene.

No one else was injured during the standoff, Montgomery said. Initially, police did not know whether Hammond’s gunshot wound was self-inflicted or he had been shot by police, but the coroner since has ruled the shooting a homicide.

Officers recovered three firearms at the scene. On Aug. 2, police identified the officer involved in the shooting as Edward Agdeppa.

The LAPD is investigating the police shooting, as is protocol each time an officer fires his or her gun. The shooting also will be reviewed by the civilian Los Angeles Police Commission, its inspector general and the district attorney’s office.
