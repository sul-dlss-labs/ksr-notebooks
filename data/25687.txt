Clark County Chief Deputy Prosecutor Scott Jackson has determined that two Vancouver police detectives acted lawfully when they fatally shot 43-year-old Carlos M. Hunter on March 7.

A group of officers was in the process of serving a search warrant on Hunter during a traffic stop in Hazel Dell, when Hunter reached for a .40-caliber Smith & Wesson handgun in his right front pants pocket, according to investigators.

Detectives Dennis Devlin, 45, and Colton Price, 30, shot Hunter in response.

“The actions of Officers Devlin and Price were in response to fear of a deadly assault,” Jackson wrote in his review, submitted to Vancouver Police Chief James McElvain on Sept. 12. “The conduct of (the officers), under the circumstances with which they were presented, was justifiable and lawful.”

The use-of-force review was provided to The Columbian last week.

On March 7, members of the Safe Streets Task Force prepared to serve a warrant on Hunter for suspicion of selling Ecstasy. The task force was “aware that Hunter had a violent criminal history, was a known gang member and that he was known to carry a .40-caliber handgun,” the review says.

Police have repeated in their reports that Hunter had gang affiliations. The man’s family has disputed that claim, stating he had ties when he was younger but severed them to focus on his five children.
