The Riverside County coroner’s office has identified the man killed by a Palm Springs police SWAT officer during a daylong standoff Thursday and Friday in Coachella.

Pascual Manuel Mata, 59, was killed after he opened fire on officers surrounding a home in the 85-500 block of Niles Lane in Coachella, the Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.

It was the third time Mata, who had barricaded himself inside the home, had fired on officers during a tense standoff that lasted more than 25 hours, the department said.

Coachella police officers had arrived about 8:15 a.m. Thursday at the home to take Mata into custody after investigators tied him to a shooting and Molotov cocktail attack on the home of a neighbor, the department said.

Officers and sheriff’s deputies tried several times to get Mata to exit the home before he began firing on them, the department said. After about 12 hours, a SWAT team made up of officers from the Palm Springs and Cathedral City police departments was called to the scene.

When Mata fired on the officers just after 9:30 a.m. Friday, a Palm Springs SWAT officer returned fire, killing Mata, the department said.

The sheriff’s Central Homicide Unit, which has jurisdiction over officer-involved shootings, is investigating the incident. Anyone with information pertinent to the investigation is asked to call sheriff’s Investigator Martin Alfaro at 760-393-3500 or Cathedral City police Detective Robert Garcia at 760-863-8990.
