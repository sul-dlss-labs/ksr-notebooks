ATCHISON, Kan. — A police officer and a suspect are dead after a shooting at an Atchison, Kansas, home on Friday afternoon.

According to Atchison Police, the officer – identified as Sgt. David Enzbrenner – was assisting a code enforcement officer serving a nuisance order at a home at 12th and Division around 4:15 p.m when he was shot by 25-year-old Skyler Barbee, who then apparently turned the gun on himself and committed suicide.

“‘For some unknown reason, an assailant came out of nowhere and apparently shot the officer,” said Atchison County Sheriff John Calhoon.

Enzbrenner was taken by air ambulance to an area hospital where he later died. According to Atchison Police, Enzbrenner had been with the department for 24 years.

Police say the investigation into the incident is ongoing. The Atchison County, Kansas, Sheriff Department declined to comment on what the relationship was between Barbee and the residents of the house where the nuisance ordinance was being served.

According to a report in the Atchison Globe, Barbee had at least one prior arrest involving assault on a law enforcement officer.

“It’s not something that happens in Atchison, Kansas, often at all and it’s very unfortunate,” said Sheriff Calhoon.
