Police have identified the driver killed in a crash Monday after a short pursuit as 24-year-old Breon Lamar Rutledge, of Dayton.

In a statement Tuesday, Richmond Police said they were following the vehicle because it was occupied by a wanted person, but they called off the pursuit before the crash occurred.

The vehicle apparently went off the road after cresting a hill on northbound State Road 227 and struck two trees before ending in the front yard of a home, according to police.

Rutledge was pronounced dead on arrival Monday afternoon at the crash in the 5800 block of Indiana 227.

Police did not elaborate about the reason for the pursuit, except that it was for a wanted person.

Police started pursuing the vehicle at approximately 1 p.m. on Indiana 227. Richmond police said officers stopped pursuing the vehicle because of the weather conditions and “the extremely dangerous fashion in which the suspect vehicle was being operated,” according to the release.

Police said the crash remains under investigation.
