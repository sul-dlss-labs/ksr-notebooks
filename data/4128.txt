Shattered glass and shell casings lay in the street. Police officers were rattled by a deadly encounter, by a choice they never wanted to make.

It all began when police responded to a shooting on South Hopper Street Friday night. Sergeant Mark Drinkard of the Montgomery Police Department says,"While in route to that scene two patrol units got behind a suspect's vehicle, which was a blue vehicle. A pursuit ensued from Coliseum and Atlanta Highway." Police say they were then led on a dangerous chase down Atlanta Highway. It ended at the intersection of Atlanta Highway and Dalraida Road, when the suspect's vehicle crashed head on with a bystander's truck. People in the area saw it all unfold.

Witness, Heather Lynch, says, "When [the suspect] slammed into the [bystander's truck], he still was alive. He was shooting at the police so the police shot back." The intersection was blocked off for hours while investigators combed the scene and spoke with witnesses. Several residents stood by an watched in awe, wondering what led to this tragic outcome.

Heather Lynch's mother, Lynn, says, "He was just gunning it and he was not paying attention to traffic or anything else. Three police cars were behind him. It was obvious he wasn't going to stop. I told my daughter, 'This is not going to end very well.'" Police haven't released the name of the man who was killed in the shooting. Due to the case involving at least one officer drawing and firing a weapon, the ABI has now taken over the investigation. As of Saturday, the ABI is not releasing any new information.

The driver and passenger of the other vehicle were treated for minor injuries at Baptist Medical Center South.
