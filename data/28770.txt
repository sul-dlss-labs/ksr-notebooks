GWINNETT COUNTY, GA — A Stone Mountain teenager was killed and a Gwinnett County police dog died in the line of duty during a deadly shootout Thursday afternoon in Norcross.

The incident started when Gwinnett County Police officers investigating gang activity discovered a stolen vehicle with two occupants behind 1900 Willow Trail Parkway. When an officer tried to make contact with the occupants, they fled in two different directions. Soon thereafter, Gwinnett County SWAT unit and its dog, K9 Blue, began searching the woods near the location. According to a statement from the Gwinnett County Police Department, K9 Blue located items from the suspect and tracked him down.

A statement from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation identified the suspect as Robert Samuel Craig Lusk, 18, of Stone Mountain. When Lusk was given commands by Gwinnett officers, the statement continued, he fired back. Officers returned fire. During the shootout, Lusk and K9 Blue were shot. Both died from their injuries after being taken to area hospitals.

Blue was the first K9 assigned full-time to Gwinnett County’s SWAT team, according to Cpl. Collin Flynn of the Gwinnett County Police Department. “He was five years old and bravely served the citizens of Gwinnett County in the police department for over a year,” Flynn said.
