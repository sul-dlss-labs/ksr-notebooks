A hit-and-run suspect who was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy during a foot chase in Oceanside last week was identified on Wednesday.

Javier Gomez, 41, was being pursued by the deputy when he ditched his car and ran toward the intersection at Camarillo and Roselle avenues about 3 p.m. Dec. 20.

Moments later, Gomez pulled out a handgun, Oceanside police said. The deputy fired at Gomez and he fell to the ground. He died before he could be taken to a hospital.

A female who was a passenger in Gomez’s car was detained, interviewed by detectives and later released.

The deputy, who was not identified, was wearing a body camera at the time of the shooting. It’s unclear how much of the incident the camera captured. Oceanside police Sgt. Gabe Jimenez said detectives had reviewed footage relevant to the incident.

Family members described Gomez as a loving man and a “beautiful soul” on a GoFundMe page created to help pay for funeral expenses.

“He has touched many lives by always making everyone laugh and feel like family,” wrote Mireya Meza, his sister.

Some family members said on social media that they still had many questions about the shooting.

“We want answers and justice,” Gomez’s niece, Viviana Lopez, wrote on Facebook. “... We want answers as to why he had to leave us in this terrible manner.”

Anyone with information about the shooting was asked to call Oceanside Detective Doug Baxter at (760) 435-4027 or an anonymous tip line at (760) 435-4730.
