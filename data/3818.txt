The Illinois State Police are investigating a crash that killed a Naperville man and injured his brother last weekend after a Will County sheriff's detective tried to pull the men over, officials said.

Christopher Bourgoine, 26, of the 2500 block of Eldorado Lane was killed in the 800 block of Simons Road in Oswego after he was thrown from his vehicle Friday night when it struck a mailbox, utility pole and eventually a tree.

His brother, Timothy, 27, also was thrown from the truck. He was taken to Rush-Copley Medical Center in Aurora immediately after the crash. A hospital spokeswoman said that he remained in fair condition.

A statement released by the Will County sheriff's office Wednesday said that the two men had been followed by police that evening after a detective noticed a snowplow in the back of their truck.

The vehicle, a red pickup truck, fit the description of a "possible suspect vehicle involved in burglaries in that area," the statement said.

Pat Barry, a spokesman for the sheriff's office, said a detective had followed the truck for a short distance, when the snowplow fell out of the vehicle at an intersection.

The detective turned on his lights, and the truck soon pulled to the side of the road. But before the detective could talk to the two men inside the truck, they pulled off at high speed and eventually crashed, Barry said.

Barry said he did not know whether the snowplow was stolen.

Kendall County Coroner Ken Toftoy said Christopher Bourgoine suffered blunt-force trauma with severe, fatal injuries to his head, neck and chest.

State Police Sgt. Jeff Hanford said the driver "lost control on a dirt road." Hanford said state police were going to reconstruct the accident and try to find its cause.

Neither brother was wearing a seatbelt, he said.
