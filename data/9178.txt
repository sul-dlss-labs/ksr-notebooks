DECATUR, AL -- The body of Benjamin Joel Durrett, 31, was pulled from the Tennessee River Monday night, following what police say was a suicide.

Shortly before 11 p.m., someone called police to say there was a possible jumper on the Interstate-65 bridge near Decatur. An Alabama State Trooper responded to the bridge and saw Durrett, from Madison, sitting on the rail.

Before the trooper could get to him, Durrett jumped and was killed in the fall. Decatur police ruled the death a suicide.
