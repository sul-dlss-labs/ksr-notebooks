A man who got into a scuffle with Huntsville police last weekend after throwing hot coals in the face of an officer has died, AL.com's news partner WHNT News 19 is reporting.

Madison County Deputy Coroner Tyler Berryhill told WHNT the coroner's office picked up the body of Curtis David Jordan, 45, from Huntsville Hospital on Thursday.

An autopsy has already been performed, but Berryhill said the coroner's office will not comment on the cause of death until the state releases the results of toxicology tests.

WHNT said the incident began last Sunday, May 31, when police answered an early morning domestic dispute call at a home in the 5900 block of Vinemont Drive in west Huntsville.

Jordan's wife called 911 after he threatened to set the couple's house on fire, WHNT is reporting.

WHNT says a man, now identified as Jordan, threw hot coals in the face of a police officer. A scuffle with police ensued, WHNT says, during which Jordan became unresponsive. Officers performed CPR on Jordan until paramedics arrived and transported him to Huntsville Hospital.

Huntsville police spokesman Lt. Darryl Lawson said the department is aware of Jordan's death. "We initiated an investigation the night of the incident, and the case is still under investigation," Lawson told AL.com Saturday.

The officer hit by the hot coals was not seriously injured, WHNT says. Click here to read WHNT's full story.
