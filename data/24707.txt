A wanted man considered violent and dangerous was shot and killed by U.S. Marshals Tuesday on the Salt River Indian Community.

According to U.S. Marshals, the suspect was located in Mesa and was seen traveling to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.

When Marshals attempted to arrest the suspect around 10 a.m., he attempted to flee the area. During the struggle, Marshals shot and killed the suspect.

In an update Wednesday, investigators identified the suspect as 42-year-old Pedro Lucero, from New Mexico.

Lucero was sought in the killing of 24-year-old Francine Delgado and the wounding of 28-year-old Rebecca Jacquez.

Farmington police said the Farmington women were hit when Lucero fired gunshots at the back of an SUV occupied by multiple people.

Lucero was sought on a warrant charging him with crimes including first-degree murder.

The US Marshals say the FBI will be the lead agency investigating the shooting.

This marks the 59th law enforcement shooting reported across the Valley so far in 2018.
