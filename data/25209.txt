The 46-year-old man shot and killed by police after a semitruck was hijacked last week has been identified by Phoenix police.

Miguel Angel Duran Delgado, 46, was suspected of carjacking the semitruck before he was shot.

Shortly after 3 p.m. on Thursday, police responded to the 3300 block of West Cambridge Avenue after a reported armed robbery in a commercial lot nearby, police said.

A man, later identified as Delgado, approached a semitruck, pointed an AR-15 rifle at the driver and motioned him out of the truck, according to police. Delgado then drove it a short way before stopping.

Police said Delgado got out of the truck in front of a home and began to walk around the truck and the front of the house carrying a replica AR-15 rifle in a "low ready" position.

Police said Delgado ignored officers' initial orders. Police fired several "less lethal" rounds at the man. A Special Assignment Unit officer fired a gunshot and struck Delgado. He was taken to a hospital and later died.

In addition to the replica AR-15 rifle, police said they discovered that man had multiple long knives and several magazines with live ammunition, including an AR-15 magazine.
