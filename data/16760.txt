Police have identified 27-year-old Jarek Kozlowski as the suspect who allegedly shot a woman in a domestic dispute in Gardnerville early Tuesday.

Kozlowski used a handgun to shoot his mother, Michelle Kozlowski, 50, during the dispute, police said in a news release.

The altercation started in the 1200 block of Manhattan Way between Kozlowski and his mother, police said. After threatening her with the gun, Jarek's brother Joseph attempted to calm him down. After Jarek put the handgun down, he and Joseph began fighting in the front yard. Jarek grabbed the gun and aimed it at Joseph, who fled the residence.

Michelle Kozlowski then confronted Jarek, who reportedly shot and killed her. She was shot in the street, according to a sheriff's press release.

Jarek confronted deputies when they arrived around 1:24 a.m.

Deputies report he fired several shots and they returned fire, striking Jarek, who ran from the house and jumped a fence. They located him shortly after and transferred him to the hospital. No deputies were hurt during the confrontation.

The Douglas County Sheriff's Office is investigating the incident.
