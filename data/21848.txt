A drug suspect was fatally shot yesterday by a Newark police officer while he was lying on the ground being handcuffed, the police and witnesses said.

The police said the man was reaching for a gun, but witnesses said he was largely subdued and called the shooting unjustified.

The suspect, Chakhan Nance, 26, of Newark, was shot in the side by Officer Jose Dopazo during an arrest that took place shortly before 2 p.m. at West Alpine Street and Irvine Turner Boulevard, the police said.

The Newark Police Department’s Office of Internal Affairs and the Essex County prosecutor’s office said they were conducting a joint investigation. The Newark police chief, Anthony Campos, defended Officer Dopazo, 30, a five-year veteran of the police force.
