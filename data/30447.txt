LAS VEGAS (KLAS) — A shooting suspect is dead following an hours-long standoff on State Route 278 from Eureka to Carlin in Northern Nevada.

The road remains closed in both directions as the investigation continues.

According to Nevada Highway Patrol, someone in a white van opened fire around 10 a.m. in a construction zone, striking a Nevada Department of Transportation worker.

Nevada Highway Patrol spotted a van speeding away from the scene. NHP pursued the van and exchanged gunfire with the suspect, who then began a standoff with troopers on State Route 278.

NHP took the suspect, an adult male, into custody just before 1:30 p.m.

The suspect was suffering from a gunshot wound. “The adult male suspect was transported from the scene and succumbed to his injuries a short time later,” according to an NHP news release.

There is still an active scene in the area and an ongoing investigation.

The NDOT worker, who was alert and conscious on the scene, was transported to the hospital. He remains in stable condition.
