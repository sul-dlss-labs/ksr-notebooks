Four Greeley police officers who unloaded 20 bullets into a man they struggled to arrest in October while he was high on meth were justified in their actions, according to a report released late Tuesday by the Weld District Attorney’s Office.

After an investigation by the Critical Incident Response Team, Weld District Attorney Michael Rourke determined the officers were justified by law in shooting and killing Danny Sanchez, 40. Sanchez rammed an unmarked police car and led officers on a short chase, during which he pointed a gun at them twice. He then ran from police while appearing to reach for a gun in his waistband in the early morning hours of Oct. 28.

Ultimately, authorities learned Sanchez was pointing a BB gun fashioned to look like a handgun, and he only had a cell phone in his waistband.

“We’ve had several instances in Weld County where individuals have BB guns and are brandishing them as if they are firearms,” Rourke said late Tuesday. “They look like firearms, and it’s unreasonable for us to expect law enforcement officers to wait to find out if it’s a real gun or a BB gun before they take action.”

Police were notified earlier that evening that Sanchez had two active felony warrants for his arrest, and he was en route to his sister’s trailer in the Villa West Trailer Park in east Greeley. They also knew he likely was not expecting to go down without a fight. He stated earlier in the evening: “My time is going to be coming soon; I’m not going back to prison.”
