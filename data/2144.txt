An unidentified homeless man sleeping on a sidewalk near the Crenshaw Plaza mall in Baldwin Hills was struck and killed early Wednesday when a police car veered out of control and onto the sidewalk, authorities said.

The two police officers were injured when their car then struck a wall.

An investigation has been launched, which will look at speed as a factor, said Lt. Horace Frank, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. Skid marks and other evidence will be examined to determine how fast the police car was going when it jumped the curb, he said.

The officers were responding to a backup call when the accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. near Crenshaw and Martin Luther King Jr. boulevards.

The officers were not identified.
