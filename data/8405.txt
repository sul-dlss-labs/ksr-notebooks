Wilson Victorian, a 59-year-old black man, was shot and killed by Gardena police on Friday, Sept. 4, in the 200 block of Dominiguez Street in Carson, authorities said.

Gardena police had responded to a report of a burglary at a NAPA auto parts store on Normandie Avenue about 4:21 a.m., said Lt. Dave Dolson of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Officers sent out a description of a truck they suspected had been used in connection with the robbery to all nearby units, Dolson said. Officers saw a truck driving southbound on Normandie Avenue that matched the description. When they pulled behind the truck the driver began to speed away, Dolson said.

He said the two officers -- who have not been identified -- told investigators the vehicle hit speeds of 90 mph. After a short pursuit down Torrance Boulevard, Victorian's truck came to a stop in a cul de sac, Dolson said.

The officers got out of their vehicle with their guns drawn. Victorian allegedly put his car into reverse and tried to run over one of the officers. Officers fired at Victorian's truck. The truck came to a stop when it jammed between a bush and a light post on the street, Dolson said.

Dolson said a dashboard video camera captured much of the incident, including Victorian backing his car toward the officers.

Victorian was shot three times, according to Los Angeles County coroner's officials, including one wound to his head and two to the left side of his torso. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Dolson said stolen property from the auto parts store was recovered from Victorian's truck.
