INDEPENDENCE, Ky. (FOX19) - An armed man is dead following Tuesday’s officer-involved shooting in Independence, Commonwealth’s Attorney Rob Sanders confirms.

Sanders says the suspect was seen burglarizing a vacant home in the 800 block of Ridgepoint Drive.

Independence and Kenton County officers responded around 7:40 a.m. and found the suspect inside the home.

An officer fired his gun after the suspect pulled out a weapon, according to Kentucky State Police.

Police and firefighters tried to save the suspect’s life but were unsuccessful.

No officers were injured, according to Sanders.

The Independence Police Department requested that KSP investigate the officer-involved shooting.

The officer, who fired the gunshot, is on paid administrative until the investigation is completed.

Carl Gillum says he has lived on Ridgepoint Drive for 17 years, and this is not the first time he has seen officers at that home.

“They have been in the past, yes, that was before the house became vacant,” said Gillum. “There was drugs involved and everything like that.”

The suspect and officer’s name have not been released.
