The suspect in a convenience store robbery died when his car rolled over multiple times during a police pursuit.

Ryan James Deaton, 30, was pronounced dead on the scene of the crash on 103rd Street late Monday.

Jacksonville Chief John Hartley said witnesses to a robbery at a Sunoco station on 103rd told police the robber fled the scene about 9:40 p.m. in a dark-colored Jeep Cherokee. An officer patrolling the area saw the Jeep driven by Deaton parked at another gas station on 103rd.

The Jeep left the parking lot followed by an officer and wouldn't stop. Officers tried to use stop sticks to disable the vehicle's tires, but Deaton continued to flee, Hartley said.

He lost control of the car and it overturned, ejecting him from the vehicle. He was not wearing a seat belt.

Deaton was sentenced to five years in prison in 2005 for attempted robbery and aggravated battery.
