TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Police in New Jersey's capital city say an off-duty corrections officer shot and killed one man and wounded another during an altercation outside a bar.

Trenton police say 51-year-old Sgt. John Jenkins was attacked at about 1:30 a.m. Friday by several men with whom he had argued inside the Candlelight Lounge.

Police said Jenkins pulled his gun and fatally shot 40-year-old Mark Ford of Trenton. Preston Winbush, also of Trenton, was shot in the wrist.

Two other men were arrested after allegedly fleeing the scene. They've been charged with aggravated assault, eluding police and resisting arrest.

The Trentonian newspaper reports that Jenkins was flown to Cooper University Hospital in Camden for treatment of unspecified injuries.

His condition was not released.
