David Buchanan was still asleep in his RV when Austin police officers silently swarmed a nearby trailer Wednesday morning in Bastrop County.

Buchanan and his wife, Vicky, had just pulled into the Lost Pines RV park the previous night. When Vicky heard police speaking over a loudspeaker to a man barricaded inside the neighboring RV, she thought Buchanan was watching his cop shows at a high volume.

“Then we realized it was happening just right here,” Buchanan said. They both watched out the windshield of their RV as the scene unfolded.

At around 8 a.m., an Austin SWAT unit was sent to serve a warrant on a man in the Bastrop County RV park just off Texas 71.

But the man wasn’t leaving his Sportsmen trailer, spurring police to conduct negotiations over a loudspeaker that roused the sleepy RV park.

“Please come out,” witnesses recalled the police saying. “We have you surrounded, We are prepared to wait as long as you’re going to wait.”

The negotiations lasted for several hours. Buchanan began cooking his breakfast as Vicky heard a single gunshot come from inside the trailer. Police then deployed a robot to make entry into the trailer, finding the man dead by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, officials said.

By around noon, Austin and Bastrop County authorities set up a crime scene. The investigation into the man’s death will be led by the Bastrop County sheriff’s office.

An Austin police spokesperson said Thursday that they could not release the identity of the man or the charges he was wanted for until next of kin has been notified.
