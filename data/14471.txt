HINTON, W.Va. — Two police officers shot and killed a man early Saturday morning in Hinton after he had allegedly assaulted his ex-wife with a knife and stabbed her boyfriend.

State Police spokesman Lt. Mike Baylous said Shane Gumm refused to drop the knife and made aggressive moves toward a State Trooper and Summers County sheriff’s deputy before they shot him.

The trooper and deputy arrived moments earlier at 105 Miller Ave. where they met Mika Gumm. She told them her ex-husband Shane Gumm had broken into the house, attacked her and stabbed her boyfriend Rick Cline. She said she grabbed a .22 caliber pistol and shot Gumm before leaving the house.

Lt. Baylous said when the two officers entered they heard Cline crying for help and spotted Gumm in the hallway between them and the victim. He said Gumm refused to put down the “large hunting knife” and made a move toward the officers who shot him. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mika Gumm suffered several cut injuries. Cline was flown to Charleston Area Medical Center and is in critical condition. He was stabbed multiple times in the stomach.

Mika Gumm had a protective order against her ex-husband.
