LAKE CHARLES, LA (KPLC) - According to reports, a man who died last week while authorities were attempting to apprehend him also "became irate" during a 2014 arrest.

Bob Corky Cox, 42, was arrested in July 2014 after an acquaintance said he would not allow her to leave the hotel at which they were staying. Cox reportedly would not allow her to use her phone and grabbed her and threatened to kill her when she tried to leave.

"After being placed under arrest, Cox became irate, kicking the back of the deputy's patrol car, breaking a camera valued under $500," Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kim Myers said at the time.



James Anderson, spokesman for Louisiana State Police Troop D, said that more recently, a bail bondsman who planned to revoke Cox's bond attempted to apprehend him in the 1700 block of Sixth Avenue on Thursday.



Cox was initially cooperative, but then he armed himself with a knife and said he would not go back to jail, Anderson said. When Lake Charles Police arrived, Cox fled, and an officer tased him. It was later discovered that he had suffered a self-inflicted stab wound.

The three Lake Charles police officers attempting to apprehend Cox — 11-year veteran William Loving, seven-year veteran Joshua Hurd and Kasie Landry, hired in March — were briefly placed on administrative leave following the incident, but they have since been returned to active duty, according to Deputy Chief Mark Kraus.

"As officers were handcuffing him, Cox stated, 'I've got a knife in me.' " Anderson said. "Officers turned Cox onto his back and saw a large knife protruding from his chest."

Cox was pronounced dead Tuesday at a local hospital.
