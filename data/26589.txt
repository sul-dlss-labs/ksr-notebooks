Athens-Clarke police on Monday released the name of the man officers said killed himself during a foot chase Thursday night on Baxter Street.

Police said Michael Shawn Sellers Jr., 26, of Athens, died after he pulled a gun during his flight and shot himself. Sellers lived on Kelli Drive in a neighborhood of Tallassee Road.

The shooting occurred at about 10:30 p.m. on the 2000 block of Baxter Street.

Authorities had responded to a battery report on the 100 block of Baxter Street prior to the shooting, according to a police report.

Police said Sellers fled and “as the suspect was about to be captured, he retrieved a pistol from his carry bag and shot himself.”

Police have not released the report showing what happened at the initial battery call, nor have they released information on the circumstances that led to the foot chase.

The chase was recorded on the officer’s body camera, according to the report.
