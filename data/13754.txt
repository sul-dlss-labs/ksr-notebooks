Cobb County police officers shot and killed a man early Monday outside a Mableton home.

Officers responded to the home in the 1500 block of Donna Street just before 1 a.m. after getting a 911 call from a woman reporting an argument with her husband, Cobb police Sgt. Dana Pierce said.

The man left before officers arrived, but “within a few minutes of getting here and while talking to the female, the male arrived in his truck, drove the truck in the middle of the yard, got out of the truck and leveled a weapon at the officers as they were trying to sort out the information from what was going on,” Pierce told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

“He was subsequently shot and he died after being transported to Atlanta Medical Center by ambulance,” Pierce said.

Police identified the dead man as Clarence Dorris, 53, of Mableton.

The officer was placed on standard administrative leave.
