FRESNO, Calif.

Monday morning, Jackallynn Chatman Puentes placed red roses on the ground, marking the spot where her sister was shot and killed Tuesday afternoon. "She was a good woman, a good mom. She worked, cleaned, took care of her house, and took care of her kids," said Jackallynn Chatman Puentes.

Police say Jennifer Chatman Puentes called 9-1-1 after she got into a fight with Haynes. When officers arrived on the scene, she was dead. Wednesday, Action News learned it wasn't the couple's first disturbance. In 2009, Haynes was charged with domestic violence and Chatman Puentes briefly had a restraining order against him. But court documents show the case was dropped a few months later, citing issues with the witness. Now, both are dead and two families are grieving.

After Tuesday's shooting, police say Haynes ran into his brother's house and refused to surrender. After a standoff that lasted into the night, police entered the apartment and found him dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

"They left their four kids. There are four kids without a mommy and daddy right now," said Jackallynn Chatman Puentes. The victim's sister says those four children range in age from 3 to 12 years old. Though police call the suspect the victim's ex-boyfriend, Jackallynn Chapman Puentes said the couple was still together and they had taken a family trip to Disneyland as recently as last week.
