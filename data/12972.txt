(KGET) A Bakersfield, California man died Monday night while in the Kern County Sheriff's Department's custody.

It's the second in-custody death in as many months.

This time, deputies say the man appeared to have choked on bags of drugs in the backseat of a patrol car after a scuffle with deputies.

Kern County Sheriff's officials say it started Monday just after 9:30pm when they went to a home attempting to locate a suspect who had a felony warrant.

That's when they say 25-year-old Wilfredo Ramos came out of another house, began acting suspiciously, and ran from deputies.

"The suspect began discarding items as they chased him. At one point, a short distance away, the deputies were able to catch up to the suspect and, after they had caught him, they became involved in a brief scuffle and were able to take the suspect to the ground and take him into custody," said Sheriff's department spokesman Ray Pruitt.

Pruitt says deputies didn't use batons, tasers, or pepper spray during the arrest. He says Ramos had minor injuries after the scuffle and deputies called for medical help.

"An ambulance did respond. They did check the suspect out. He had some minor abrasions and refused medical aid and at that point the ambulance personnel cleared the scene," said Pruitt.
