ESCONDIDO, Calif. â€” A man was found dead in a hotel room from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound following a standoff Tuesday. Police and a SWAT team positioned themselves outside the Hacienda Motel in Escondido following a report of shots fired on Tuesday afternoon.

Police said they were originally called by hotel staff because a man was refusing to check out of his room. Officers arrived and knocked but the man refused to come out and told them he had a gun. Officers retreated and heard two shots come from the room.

Officers including SWAT personnel took up positions outside the building and have closed down a stretch of street in front of it as they try to make contact a man believed to be inside the motel room.

Officers tried without success to make contact with the man believed to be in the room where the shooting apparently occurred, closed a stretch of the street in front of the motel as a precaution and called in special weapons and tactics personnel, Sgt. Paul Woodward said.
