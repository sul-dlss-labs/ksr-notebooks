The Collinsville Police Department is mourning the loss of an officer in a double fatal car crash Monday.

Officials said 48-year-old Douglas Goodner, a current Reserve Officer with the Collinsville Department, and 59-year-old William McWhirt were killed in a two-vehicle accident just northwest of Afton around 11:45 a.m. Monday.

Collinsville Police said Goodner was not on duty at the time of the crash. Officials said somehow Goodner and a large farming vehicle collided. Troopers said McWhirt was one of Goodner's passengers and another passenger was flown to a nearby hospital with serious injuries.

Police said Goodner served as a full-time officer for eight years with Collinsville Police until he was deployed to Afghanistan. He served as a Reserve Police Officer for the past two years.

He is survived by his wife and four children. The department asks anyone who wishes to bring cards, flowers or other items for the family to take them to the Collinsville Police Department.
