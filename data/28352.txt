A Carter County deputy sheriff eventually responded to the scene and was able to help take Mr. Lakey into custody, according to the bureau. Shortly thereafter, Mr. Lakey stopped breathing and became unresponsive. He was taken to a hospital in Healdton, Okla., and then to OU Medical Center in Oklahoma City, where he died on July 6, 2019.

Court records said that “such dangerous and unnecessary tasing” was a “substantial factor” in bringing about Mr. Lakey’s death.

The district attorney’s office issued arrest warrants for Mr. Taylor and Mr. Dingman on Wednesday, and they turned themselves in on Thursday morning. They were booked on one count each of second-degree murder, which is punishable by 10 years to life in prison, according to court records.

Both were released on $250,000 bonds, according to the State Bureau of Investigation.

“The death of Mr. Lakey saddens us all,” Ryan Hunnicutt, who was listed in court records as the lawyer for both Mr. Dingman and Mr. Taylor, said in an email on Thursday night. “We are confident that the legal system will provide an opportunity for all the facts to be known and look forward to our day in court.”

Calls to the Wilson Police Department were not immediately returned on Thursday, and it was not immediately clear if Mr. Dingman and Mr. Taylor were still on the force.
