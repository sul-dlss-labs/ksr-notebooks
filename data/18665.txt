A 38-year-old man was shot and killed by Phoenix police after he led them on a chase and threatened to shoot them Monday afternoon, authorities said.

It wasn't immediately clear whether the man had a weapon on him, but officers witnessed him concealing his hand in such a way that it appeared he may have been armed, according to a Phoenix police spokesman.

The foot chase began when officers were investigating a felony warrant for one of two people inside a white SUV parked near 35th and Alice avenues, Sgt. Vince Lewis said.

The driver, who had a warrant out for his arrest for failure to register as a sex offender, was taken into custody and placed in the back of a patrol car, Lewis said.

One other person, the 38-year-old man, was in the passenger seat while police continued to search the vehicle and located a shotgun, Lewis said.

When officers began a discussion with the man, he ran away, leading officers on a chase in a northeast direction, Lewis said.

Lewis said the man continually made threats to the officers while running, saying he had a weapon and that he was going to shoot the officers.

As they approached Tangerine Lane, the man passed a third officer, who had initially been responding to a separate incident but joined in the pursuit. Suddenly, the suspect spun around, and two of the officers fired their weapons and hit him, Lewis said.

The man was taken to a nearby trauma center in extremely critical condition, where he died from his injuries, Lewis said.

Lewis said it was unclear if the man had a weapon, citing that the investigation was ongoing.

He said the officers who fired their weapons were among the first responding officers; one of them has been with the Phoenix Police Department for at least 20 years.

Police tape blocked the entrance into the neighborhood on Alice Avenue, and investigators were still on the scene Monday evening, gathering evidence and re-creating the shooting.
