A Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a man who opened fire at him while trying to flee during a traffic stop in South L.A.’s Hyde Park neighborhood early Thursday, the agency said.

The shooting broke out after the lone officer pulled over a vehicle for some type of moving violation around 1 a.m. near Brynhurst Avenue and 71st Street, Lt. Brandon Dean told reporters.

After the driver stopped, the man in the front passenger seat exited the vehicle and started walking away, Dean said.

The deputy told him to stop and show his hands, but the man continued, took out a firearm and shot at the officer, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

That’s when the deputy fired numerous rounds at the man, striking him in the torso, officials said. Paramedics responded to the scene and pronounced him dead. Authorities have not released his identity but described him as a man about 20 to 25 years old.

The driver, also a man, fled in a tan mid-2000s SUV, Dean said. Detectives don’t believe the vehicle had any other occupant.

The officer, who did not get hurt, was not wearing a body camera, the lieutenant added. His vehicle did not have a dashcam either.

Investigators reported recovering a semiautomatic handgun they believe the suspect used.

Video from the scene shows a large presence of deputies at an Arco gas station in the area and the smaller street behind it.

Authorities provided no further details.
