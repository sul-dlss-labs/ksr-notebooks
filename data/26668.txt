HOUSTON — A vehicle packed with undocumented migrants crashed in rural South Texas after it was chased by police, veering into a ditch in rainy weather and killing six people who were found Wednesday morning — the latest in a series of deadly crashes involving immigrants near the border.

The crash occurred on the outskirts of the town of Robstown, about 20 miles west of Corpus Christi.

The S.U.V. was packed with more than a dozen migrants and had been speeding when a Robstown police officer tried to pull it over on Tuesday evening, the authorities said. The driver sped away in the rain, and the police ended the chase when the officer lost the vehicle in a brush-covered area.

At some point after the chase, the driver of the S.U.V. appeared to have lost control and crashed into a drainage ditch next to a dirt road in a field. Authorities discovered the wreckage at the bottom of the 15-foot-deep ditch hours later.

Six men were found dead inside the vehicle. Six other men were outside the vehicle, and another man was found later nearby. All seven of the injured migrants were transported to local hospitals, and the authorities on Wednesday were still searching for the driver, who appeared to have escaped, officials said.
