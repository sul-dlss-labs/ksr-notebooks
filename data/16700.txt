MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. â€“ Police said officers were forced to fatally shoot a knife-wielding man in southwest Miami-Dade County.

The shooting happened about 2 a.m. Thursday at an apartment complex near Southwest 197th Street and Southwest 112th Avenue.

Miami-Dade police said they received a 911 call about a possible stabbing. When officers arrived, they said a 13-year-old boy and his mother were found stabbed.

When police found the armed man, identified as Ernesto Medina Lopez, 42, there was an altercation that led to the shooting.

Police said Lopez, who is the husband and father of the two victims, may have had mental illness.

A security guard at the complex said he heard a loud noise and saw the teen bleeding in the street and screaming for help.

"He was bleeding," Luis Morales said. "I automatically identified the wounds, called 911 and applied pressure to the wounds."

A woman who claimed to be a family friend identified the victims as Betsy Bisset, 35, and Ernesto Medina Jr.

"They were a very calm family and they were really good people," Aurora Hernandez said.

According to Hernandez, Lopez suffered from epilepsy. She said she talked to Bisset Wednesday night, and Bisset told her that Lopez had become angry after an episode.

"He hit her in the face," Hernandez said.

Both victims were airlifted to Jackson Memorial Hospital. Their conditions have not been released.
