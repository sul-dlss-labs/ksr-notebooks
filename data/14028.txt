FAYETTEVILLE, N.C. â€” A 25-year-old man injured by gunfire early Saturday following a high-speed chase in Hope Mills has died, authorities said.

Kevin Dejon Grissett was shot by a police officer shortly after 1 a.m. after crashing his car into law enforcement vehicles. He was taken to Cape Fear Valley Medical Center, where he later died, officials said.

The high-speed chase started at about 1 a.m. in Hope Mills after authorities tried to pull over a 1993 Cadillac in connection with a drug investigation.

It ended a short time later on National Drive, off of Snow Hill Road, when the Cadillac rammed two law enforcement vehicles. Officers fired at the car, hitting Grissett.

An officer was also taken to the hospital following the incident for the treatment of minor injuries.

A passenger in the car fled the scene on foot, police said. A description of him was not immediately available.

No information about possible charges has been released.

The Hope Mills Police Department contacted the State Bureau of Investigation following the incident to complete the investigation, standard practice following an officer-involved shooting.
