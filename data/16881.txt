OVIEDO, Fla. — Two burglary suspects were killed Monday afternoon when the stolen SUV they were in crashed and flipped on State Road 417, authorities said.

The crash shut down State Road 417 between Lake Mary Boulevard and State Road 434 near Lake Jesup for several hours.

Authorities said five people were in the Acura SUV. One died at the scene and the other died at the hospital. Three others remain in critical condition.

Sanford police said it started at a home on Scott Avenue where a neighbor reported a burglary.

“It makes a difference when you have neighbors that are aware and alert and they are not afraid to get involved,” said resident Claudia Webber.

The suspect driving the SUV took off. Seminole County deputies said they followed the car in their helicopter while other deputies deployed stop sticks.

Deputies said the SUV struck the stop sticks, rolled over several times and sent debris into the roadway. The five people were thrown from the SUV.

A witness, who asked not to be identified, said she believed the SUV was going at least 100 mph when it passed her on the bridge over Lake Jesup.

“The next thing I saw was a puff of smoke in the middle of the intersection past the bridge, and unfortunately, seeing two people flying through the air,” she said.

When she pulled closer to the crash site, she saw one man lying lifeless on the side of the road.

“It’s not worth dying over, not like that, especially because they all looked very young,” said the witness.

The Florida Highway Patrol said the names of those involved have not been released.

WFTV legal analyst Belvin Perry said the three survivors could be charged with second-degree murder because two of their accomplices died.
