A Rapides Parish Sheriff's deputy fatally shot a man Thursday morning in Pineville after he had pointed a gun at deputies and had refused to drop the weapon, according to a release.

The unidentified man was pronounced dead at the scene by Acadian Ambulance personnel, who had been waiting nearby. His name is not being released until notification of next of kin, states a sheriff's office release.

Deputies had been called to the 300 block of Iris Park Drive off Edgewood Drive around 10:08 a.m. because, according to an intial report, the man had threatened someone else in the house with a firearm before threatening to harm himself.

"Deputies arrived and began talking to the subject for almost an hour when the subject exited a room and pointed a handgun at deputies," reads the release.

The deputies told him to drop the gun, but he again pointed the gun at deputies. At that point, a deputy fired and hit him in the upper chest area, according to the release.

The deputies rendered medical aid until Acadian arrived.

Sheriff's office detectives, crime scene investigators and Rapides Parish District Attorney's Office investigators have been at the scene to conduct an investigation, according to the release.
