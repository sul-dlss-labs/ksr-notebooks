A Brooklyn man who was killed in a gunfight with police Friday had a long criminal record, police said yesterday. Curtis Merriweather, 45, was killed after he fired a 9-mm. handgun at two plainclothes cops at Avenue D and Nostrand Ave., police said. Just before the gunfire, Merriweather was involved in a dispute with Wayne Williamson, which was apparently sparked because Merriweather was sitting on Williamson's car, police said. Merriweather left and returned with a gun; Williamson pulled out a large knife. When the cops approached, they ordered the men not to move. Merriweather fired his weapon at Williamson, 29, hitting him six times in the torso. Then he turned and fired a shot in the direction of the officers. Police returned fire, with several bullets hitting Merriweather, killing him. Williamson is in serious but stable condition at Kings County Hospital. The names of the officers were not released. Police said Merriweather, of E. 28th St. near Ditmas Ave., had 17 arrests, mostly for drugs and petty larceny.
