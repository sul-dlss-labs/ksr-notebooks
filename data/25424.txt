The initial report says Juston Joseph Landry, 26, “presented” a handgun during an argument with a store clerk and when confronted by a Lake Charles Police Department officer.

Landry was killed on Martin Luther King Hwy. on Jan. 11, by a police officer responding to a report of a man threatening another with a gun, authorities said. Police were called to the RaceWay gas station in the 1200 block of MLK Hwy. The officer located Landry about a block away. The shooting took place in the 1000 block of MLK, near the intersection with Pineview Street.

The initial report was compiled by state police, which is investigating the shooting at the request of Lake Charles police.

The complaint says that state police learned that a male subject, later identified as Landry, became involved in a verbal argument with a clerk at Raceway. Landry “presented” a gun and threatened the clerk.

Landry then left the store and headed south on foot on MLK Drive, according to the report. The police officer located Landry, who “presented a handgun and refused to comply with commands.”

A short foot pursuit ensued, ending with an “encounter that resulted in (Landry) being shot multiple times.”

Landry was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

The report does not list the name of the Lake Charles police officer. It was released to KPLC as part of a public records request that included the name of the officer, and body cam and dashcam videos. State police declined those request because they are part of an ongoing investigation.
