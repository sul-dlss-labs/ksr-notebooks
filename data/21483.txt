Roseville police say a man has died and two other people are in critical condition after a hit-and-run crash involving an SUV carrying two larceny suspects fleeing arrest.

Roseville Police Chief James Berlin says the crash Thursday afternoon killed a 51-year-old man and injured a man and woman in their early 70s, all from Warren. Their names havenâ€™t been released.

Berlin tells the Macomb Daily the two larceny suspects ran from the crash scene in different directions, and one of them, a 45-year-old Warren man, was found hiding in a backyard.

Police say the SUV fled a public works yard in nearby Fraser at a high rate of speed and ran a red light, colliding with the car.
