Authorities have released the identity of a man shot to death Sunday morning in Yucca Valley after he wrestled with a Sheriff’s Deputy’s Taser.

Merlyn Arthur King, a 31 year-old resident of Yucca Valley, died after the deputy shot him, according to the San Bernardino County Coroner’s Office.

Deputies responded to a call just before 9 a.m. in a lot near the corner of Kickapoo Trail and Highway 62. A caller reported there was a man in the lot acting suspicious.

Deputies tried to contact the man – now identified as King – but he charged one of the deputies, who pulled out his Taser.

After King allegedly grabbed the Taser, he continued attacking the deputy, and the deputy shot him, according to the news release.

Emergency personnel responded and pronounced king dead at the scene.
