A Memphis police officer was fired and accused of kidnapping and killing a man while on duty, the authorities said on Sunday.

The killing took place last week, and the officer, Patric Ferguson, was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree murder in perpetration of aggravated kidnapping, abuse of a corpse, and fabricating and tampering with evidence, according to the Memphis Police Department.

It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Ferguson, 29, or a second man charged in the case, Joshua Rogers, 28, had lawyers.

The authorities did not describe a possible motive behind the shooting or say how the police connected the men to the killing. The Memphis Police Department and the Shelby County Sheriffâ€™s Office did not immediately return requests for comment.
