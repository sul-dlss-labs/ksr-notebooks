GEORGETOWN -- A man is dead and another wounded following a series of events that culminated in an officer-involved shooting Friday around 10:30 p.m. in Georgetown County.

Luke Gamble, 59, of 18 Oxford Lane, died of a gunshot wound, Georgetown County Coroner Kenny Johnson said. The autopsy was conducted Saturday morning. Johnson said he suffered multiple gunshot wounds and one of them was to the chest.

His body was located at the intersection of Oxford Lane and Lincolnshire Drive, Johnson said.

"Sheriff’s deputies were dispatched to a residence on Lincolnshire Drive, in the Greentown section of Georgetown County, for an alleged stabbing that occurred and the suspect was still in the area. When sheriff’s deputies arrived, reportedly they were met by a man with a knife that was approaching them refusing to stop," Georgetown County Sheriff's Sgt. Neil Johnson wrote in a release sent to area media Saturday morning.

The two deputies have been placed on administrative leave and are assisting in the investigation, Georgetown County Assistant Sheriff Carter Weaver said.

"The South Carolina State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) was called to investigate the shooting and the incident involving the stabbing of the victim who was transported to the Georgetown Memorial Hospital by EMS with serious injuries," Johnson said.

Because SLED is investigating the sheriff's office won't be able to release any further information, Johnson said.

SLED Inspector Richard Hunton confirmed agents were called out to the incident and added the shooting was an open investigation and he couldn’t comment further.

The identity and condition of the stabbing victim were unavailable.
