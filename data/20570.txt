An almost 11-hour standoff today between police and a Lower Macungie Township man barricaded in his home ended after the man shot himself to death, said Pennsylvania State Police at Fogelsville.



Trevor D. Sterner, 40, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the Lehigh County Coroner's Office ruled, according to state police.



Police said Sterner was despondent after a family dispute about 8:23 this morning and went with a handgun into the basement of his home on the 1200 block of Eagle Street in the Shepherd Hills community of the township.



A state police Special Emergency Response Team negotiated with Sterner, police said, but he was found dead inside at 7 this evening.



Surrounding homes were evacuated for several hours.



State police are continuing an investigation.
