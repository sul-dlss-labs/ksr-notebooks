One person is dead after being shot by a Kentucky State Police trooper in Shelby County.Authorities said a woman called police asking officers to get someone off her front yard, on Hazel Lawn Drive in Shelbyville.When the trooper stopped, the suspect started firing shots.The trooper ran back to his car and returned fire, hitting Christopher Horine.WLKY spoke to a witness who saw some of the event unfold.Ray Athey thought he was hearing firecrackers on Sunday night, but as he got closer he noticed it turned out to be a deadly encounter between state Trooper Eddie Whitworth and 42-year-old Horine."And the guy kept cussing at the officer. I could hear cussing," Athey said.Ray Athey, a Vietnam War veteran and neighbor, is one of the last people to hear Horine’s voice.His neighbor on Hazel Lawn Drive called 911 to report a trespassing."I think he was an old boyfriend of hers or something," said Athey.KSP spokesman Trooper Brad Arterburn says when Trooper Eddie Whitworth responded to the call, Horine started firing a gun, forcing the trooper to run back to his car to protect himself.Athey was watching from his porch.“There was an officer behind the spotlight with his pistol already drawn, and I heard him yell, ‘It doesn't have to end this way,’" said Athey. Arterburn says Horine continued firing the gun as he walked towards Whitworth."At that point the trooper shot the individual. That individual was transported to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead," said Arterburn."The officer tried to talk him. He didn't just shoot him. He tried to find out what was going on. He was talking to him; trying to calm him down,” said Athey.When WLKY asked Athey if he thought want the officer did was right, he said, “Well, yeah.”“He had shot three times towards the police officer before the officer even returned fire," said Athey.The trooper has been placed on administrative leave, which is standard procedure.
