BREAUX BRIDGE, La. (AP) - A suspect in a pair of attacks that killed one man and injured two other people is dead after being confronted by police near Breaux Bridge.

State police say the shooting of 34-year-old Jonathan Scott Latham took place at a home late Friday after attacks in Iberia and Vermilion parishes. Sgt. David Anderson, a state police spokesman, says authorities have not determined whether Latham shot himself or was hit by a bullet fired by St. Martin Parish sheriff's deputies. Authorities had been seeking Latham since late Thursday when a 17-year-old boy was cut on his neck with a knife in Vermilion Parish.

The victim was not seriously hurt. Police say that attack was followed by another at a Couteu home early Friday where 78-year-old Oscar Figueroa was killed and an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and beaten. Authorities have not said how Figueroa was killed.
