Ezequiel Garcia, a 45-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by a supervisor with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Thursday, Feb. 16, in the 500 block of West Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Garcia, a supervisory agent at the agency, shot his supervisor, Kevin Kozak, during a discussion about Garcia's job performance Thursday evening.

Kozak, 51, second-in-command of ICE in Los Angeles, sustained six gunshot wounds to his legs, upper torso and hands.

Garcia was shot to death by another supervisor in the office.

Kozak remains hospitalized but is in stable condition. He is alert and talking, officials said at a news conference.

Authorities did not identify the supervisor who shot Garcia.

“Kozak is alive today because of the heroic action of another ICE supervisor,” said Claude Arnold, special agent in charge for ICE in Los Angeles. “This is the first time anything of this nature has occurred within ICE,” he said.
