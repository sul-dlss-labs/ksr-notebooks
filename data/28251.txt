The Kansas City Police Department and the Missouri Highway Patrol are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting in the 2300 block of Lister Avenue that occurred Saturday afternoon.The man who was shot has been identified as 22-year-old William Slyter of Kansas City, Missouri. Sergeant Andy Bell with the Missouri State Highway patrol said around 1:30 p.m. KCPD officers were called to the area on a report of an armed carjacking. About 15 minutes later, a KCPD officer found the vehicle in the area of 20th and Elmwood. The officer tried to stop the suspect vehicle, but the suspect refused to stop. After a pursuit with KCPD, the suspect fled the scene near 2300 Lister on foot and one officer began a foot pursuit, according to the MSHP. At that time, the MSHP said the suspect presented some type of handgun.“The officer appeared to do what he had to do,” the spokesperson with MSPH said. “In this case, he fired a single round. At that point, emergency services were rendered to that suspect. That suspect is deceased here at the scene."The MSHP said a handgun was recovered at the scene. The Patrol’s Division of Drug and Crime Control investigators were requested to respond to the scene.Per the new protocol setup by the city of Kansas City, KCPD said the MSHP will investigating the shooting and their investigators are at the scene. Mayor Quinton Lucas’ office said the victim was an adult white male.“I called an emergency Board of Police Commissioners meeting roughly one week ago to review and immediately enact police oversight policies to help build community trust and ensure transparency,” Lucas said in a statement on the shooting. “One of those measures requires an outside enforcement agency to investigate any officer-involved shooting that occurs in Kansas City.”Lucas said he has spoken with Kansas City Police Chief Rick Smith and Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker about the situation. “Pursuant to our new board policy, the Missouri Highway Patrol is now on the scene to handle the investigation into this incident, rather than the Kansas City Police Department, and will be communicating with the public and press in connection with this incident,” Lucas said.
