Authorities today released the name of a man who was shot and killed when Birmingham police responded to a domestic incident at his east Birmingham home.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the man as Steven Wayne Truex. He was 38.

Birmingham police spokesman Lt. Sean Edwards said East Precinct officers responded about 4:20 p.m. to a home in the 400 block of Prince Drive on a report of domestic strangulation. When officers arrived on the scene, they spoke with the victim and her daughter.

The daughter told police her stepfather had "choked" her mother and was still at their home in the 400 block of Dalton Drive. The victim told police that the suspect - now identified as Truex - did own weapons and may be armed.

When officers got to the home, they saw Truex standing in the front doorway. He was given several verbal commands to show his hands but failed to comply, Edwards said. Fearing the suspect was armed, officers deployed their Taser stun guns to try to take him into custody, but the Taser was not effective.

Truex, police said, then brandished a 12-gauge shotgun and both officers fired their weapons, hitting Truex. Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service pronounced Truex dead on the scene at 5:06 p.m., according to the coroner's office.

"What the officers attempted to do was try to diffuse the situation," Edwards said Thursday night. "It's apparent that this individual was not complying. He still was armed. Officers, based on their perception, they had to discharge their weapon and the individual was struck."

Truex previously lived in Bessemer. Court records do not reflect any criminal history for him.

The State Bureau of Investigation responded to the scene and took over the case, which is standard procedure in most officer-involved shootings.
