A suspect in a string of armed robberies shot and killed himself Wednesday night after fleeing from Tallahassee police and Leon county deputies.

The Leon County Sheriff's Office identified the man Friday as Demarquez Patterson, 25.

Deputies responded around 9:30 p.m. Wednesday to a report of an armed robbery at a business in the 5600 block of Capital Circle Northwest, the Sheriff's Office said in a news release.

Patterson entered the store with a gun and demanded money from an employee. He fled before deputies arrived. A couple of hours later, Tallahassee Police Department officers tried to make contact with him at his home, but he sped away in his vehicle.

Deputies attempted a traffic stop, but Patterson refused to pull over, driving at a high rate of speed until he crashed into a utility pole at Mission Road and Mission Trail.

"After the crash, Patterson got out of the vehicle and ran north on Mission Road, while pointing a handgun at his head," the Sheriff's Office said. "An LCSO deputy released his K9, who bit Patterson during apprehension. During this time, a shot was heard, and Patterson was located with a self-inflicted gunshot wound."

Officers rendered medical aid at the scene, but he died after he was taken to a local hospital. The Sheriff's Office said evidence was later seized during a search of Patterson's home. It did not release details of the other robberies.

"The circumstances surrounding the suspectâ€™s death are unfortunate," the Sheriff's Office said, "and every loss of human life impacts the community."
