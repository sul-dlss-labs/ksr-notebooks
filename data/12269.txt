A State Bureau of Investigation search warrant confirms there was a shootout between the Halifax County Sheriff’s Office and a suspected drug dealer who was killed in January.

The warrant, filed by SBI Special Agent Mike Harper, does not go into great detail about the January 18 shooting at 142 Straight Road between narcotics Agent A.M. Harris, Detective H.L. Williams and suspected marijuana dealer Reginald Lamont “Deucey” Epps.

The SBI search warrant says the sheriff’s office obtained a search warrant the previous day to search Epps’ residence for narcotics violations.

The search warrant says on the morning of January 18 the sheriff’s office executed its search warrant. “According to Lieutenant Scott Hall, upon entry, the Halifax County Sheriff’s (Office) announced themselves. The Halifax County Sheriff’s (Office) was confronted by a black male believed to be Reginald Lamont Epps. Epps fired at the deputies. The sheriff’s (office) returned fire. Epps was killed at the scene.”

Harper notes in the search warrant the sheriff’s office requested the SBI investigate because officers were involved in the shooting. “The affiant believes that probable cause exists that Reginald Lamont Epps was shot and killed by deputies with the Halifax County Sheriff’s (Office).”

The SBI applied for the search warrant to seize firearms, shell casings, ammunition, projectiles and tool marks. The agency was also looking for trace evidence, hair, fibers and latent evidence.

The search warrant sought to collect bodily fluids, blood, salvia and DNA as well as knives, blunt weapons, drugs, narcotics and identifying documents. It also included a search for evidence relevant to the crime of homicide.

The items seized from the scene show Epps fired at the sheriff’s office and the sheriff’s office returned fired.

The SBI collected 42 Speer shell casings, which are the bullets the sheriff’s office uses. It collected 25 shell casings from a weapon or weapons Epps apparently used — 17 Blaze shell casings, six Winchester shell casings and two Remington shell casings.

The SBI collected a total of six projectiles and six magazines from Epps’s residence. Also collected from Epps’ residence was the following:

• A Maverick model 12-guage shotgun

• A Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver

• A Smith and Wesson .38-caliber revolver with five live rounds

• A Hi Point .40-caliber pistol

• A Remington Model 700 rifle

• A Cobray 9mm with 25 live rounds

The sheriff’s office had no comment on the search warrant this morning, as the SBI investigation is ongoing.

The sheriff’s office search warrant reviewed by rrspin.com in January shows three controlled buys were allegedly made from Epps before the execution of their warrant.

rrspin.com has requested the autopsy report from the state Medical Examiner’s Office but it has not been received.
