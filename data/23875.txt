CLEVELAND, Ohio — When a Cleveland woman heard a loud noise around 2:30 a.m. Tuesday, she thought someone was breaking into her home.

“I woke up to this horrible noise,” the woman, who requested that her name not be used, said. “It scared me so I came down to see what was going on.”

She said when she looked out her door she saw sirens and police officers everywhere.

Cleveland police said a car, believed to be stolen, crashed at Harvard Avenue and East 151st Street.

The car was split into three pieces and debris was everywhere. Both people inside the car, a man and a woman, were killed.

“I’ve never seen a car like this in my entire life,” the neighbor said. “It looked like something that was in a junkyard and it was like in three different pieces. It was horrible.”

Police estimated the car was traveling at about 100 mph when it crashed into a tree.

Shaker Heights police spotted the car, which had been reported stolen, in their city a few minutes earlier. They tried to stop the vehicle when the driver took off. They chased the car into Cleveland where it crashed just a few minutes later.

Harvard Avenue was closed between East 148th Street and East 154th Street while police investigated.
