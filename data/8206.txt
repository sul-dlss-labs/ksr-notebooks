As spring bakes into summer, some parents enroll their children in day camps with scheduled activities like exercise, crafts and games.

The Heritage Center in Leavenworth is doing the same thing, albeit for a different audience.

Camp Heritage began Monday‚ a five-day camp for seniors at the center that features a number of different activities, each day carrying a specific theme: Monday was “the beach,” Tuesday was “health and wellness,” Wednesday was “Casino Royale,” Thursday is “western,” and Friday’s theme is “Red, White and Blue.”
