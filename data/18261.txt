Law enforcement officers pursued a stolen car from Missouri into Arkansas Sunday, and one person died during the chase.

The victim was unrelated to the pursuit, according to Arkansas State Police.

Police in Kennett, Missouri, were pursuing a vehicle believed to be stolen in Collinsville, Illinois.

The suspect drove across the border into Arkansas, prompting Clay County deputies to take up the pursuit.

Police said a Clay County deputy saw the car on U.S. 49 near Rector. As the deputy followed it into the city, the deputy’s car hit another vehicle.

The driver of that vehicle, which was not involved in the pursuit, died. Police identified the driver as Sadine Dixon, 84, of Rector.

The deputy, Terry Burdin, was injured and taken to the hospital, police said.

The pursuit eventually ended in Paragould when the suspect’s car hit a concrete retaining wall.

Police identified the driver as Robert Huffines, 36, of Holcomb, Missouri. Lea Mamino, 32, of Collinsville, Illinois, was a passenger in the car, police said.

Both were taken into custody and are being held at the Greene County Jail.

Charges are pending, police said.

Arkansas State Police are investigating the crash that killed Dixon as well as the crash that ended the pursuit.
