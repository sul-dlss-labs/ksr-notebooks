Opelousas police have identified the man that was killed in in a standoff in an apartment complex that started early Sunday morning.

John Kenneth Hedden, 30, was killed by a self-inflicted gunshot wound that ended an eight-hour standoff at the Chateau Wein complex on Sunday, police officer Corey Leger said.

Leger also said that Hedden and the woman are both originally from Indiana and have lived in the apartment for only five months.

Hedden barricaded himself in his apartment after police were called to the scene around 3 a.m. Sunday morning when his girlfriend called police during an argument, Leger said. The womanâ€™s name has not been released.

Officers arrived to the scene to see both Hedden and the woman outside in an argument. Hedden then went inside and did not come out.

After the woman warned police of Hedden owning several guns, Opelousas police officers and Louisiana State Police officers surrounded the complex.

After trying to negotiate with Hedden, state police sent in a robot into the complex with a camera on, which discovered that Hedden had died from a gunshot wound.

Leger said that the incident is still under investigation.
