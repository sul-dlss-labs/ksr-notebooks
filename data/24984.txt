Hawaii island police said three officers shot and killed a 26-year-old woman after she repeatedly rammed a stolen vehicle into a police SUV early this morning in Puna.

The woman was identified as Ashley Elisna Grammer. Police said Grammer was a fugitive being sought on two $50,000 warrants.

Puna officers were patrolling on Beach Road at 1 a.m. when they came upon a 1998 Toyota 4-Runner parked on a narrow dirt trail near the ocean, according to a police news release.

While the officers were exiting their vehicle, the Toyota suddenly reversed at a high rate of speed, ramming the front end of the police car and knocking one officer out of the vehicle, police said. The driver of the 4-Runner then drove back and forth, ramming into the police vehicle numerous times, they said.

Police said two officers on foot were in danger of being hit. The three officers fired into the 4-Runner, striking Grammer. The officers involved were not injured.

A 22-year old female passenger was not injured, according to police who have opened an attempted murder investigation.

Police said the suspectâ€™s vehicle had fraudulent license plates and had been reported stolen on Sunday from a Hilo parking lot.

The officers have been on the police force for 1, 3, and 7 years, and have been placed on administrative leave as the incident is investigated, which is standard practice in a police-involved shooting. The Office of Professional Standards is conducting an administrative investigation.

Police ask anyone who witnessed the incident to contact Detective William Brown at 961-2384.
