Police say an unidentified man shot and killed himself during a standoff with police Wednesday night.

Shortly before 8 p.m. officers say they were flagged down in the 2700 block of East 11th Street about a possible suicidal man with a gun. Police said the man's wife found him highly intoxicated with a pistol in his lap.

Before officers arrived, they said the man drove off in a Chevy pickup.

Just before 8:30 p.m., police said someone called police after finding a man passed out in a pickup in the 600 block of Detroit.

Police said when officers tried to talk with the man, he drove off again, heading east on 6th Street with police in pursuit. Police say the man fired two shots at officers before stopping his truck in the 2500 block of East 6th Street.

Police said that is when officers heard a third gunshot.

After attempting to communicate with the man, officers approached the truck and found the man dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Police have not yet released the man's name.
