Authorities have released the name of the man who was fatally shot by a Tulsa County deputy in Creek County after he reportedly approached the deputy with a knife. However, the deputy's name still was not released Wednesday.

Justin Dale Wolfe, 49, was pronounced dead at the scene of the Tuesday afternoon shooting in the 6600 block of South 80th West Avenue, Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Jessica Brown said Wednesday.

Tulsa County Undersheriff Brian Edwards would not release the name of the deputy who shot Wolfe, saying he wanted to give the OSBI the opportunity to investigate.

Edwards said he expects to release the deputy's name Thursday.

Because the shooting occurred in Creek County, deputies from that county and OSBI agents are investigating.

Brown said Wolfe lived a few blocks from the house where he was shot.

Preliminary information indicates that two deputies went to the house about 2:50 p.m. to conduct interviews as part of their assignment to an FBI gangs task force, according to Edwards.

He said he couldn't be more specific about the nature of the case they were working on because it is part of an ongoing investigation.

"They were just there to question them when it turned violent," Edwards said.

After the OSBI and the Creek County Sheriff's Office finish their investigation, they will forward their findings to the Creek County District Attorney's Office so that prosecutors can review the shooting.
