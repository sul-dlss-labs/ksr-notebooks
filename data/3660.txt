The chase began about 3 a.m. when Mr. Guzman, who was driving a 2004 Mercury Mountaineer, stopped to get gas at an Exxon station in Corona, where he was a regular customer, the station owner said. A female passenger was in the car

But Mr. Guzman was nervous because he saw a police car across the street, said the owner, Blessington Schellenberg. Mr. Schellenberg was not there at the time but was relaying the account of the manager on duty, who told him that Mr. Guzman had been argumentative, claiming the gas station had ripped him off, and that he waited for the police car to leave before leaving himself. The police car followed, Mr. Schellenberg said.

The police said the officers suspected that the car, which had Nevada plates, was stolen. The call went out on the radio, and the lieutenant, who was at the nearby 115th Precinct station house, heard the call. A police union official identified the lieutenant as Andrius Bagazunas, an officer in the Queens North Auto Larceny Unit. He and the sergeant, who is in the precinct's anticrime unit, joined the pursuit.

While his passenger pleaded with him to stop, the police said, Mr. Guzman remained silent. He ran red lights, took one-way streets in the wrong direction and sped through Queens, they said. "He's not looking at her, he's not talking to her, he's just going," one police official said.

Later, the police found a small amount of cocaine and a bottle of Hennessy Cognac in the Mercury, they said. The woman rented the car at Kennedy International Airport in June and had not returned it on time, but it had not officially been reported stolen, the police said.
