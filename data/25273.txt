A Batesville woman is dead and two Florida women are in custody after a police chase across north Mississippi Thursday, authorities said.

The Mississippi Highway Patrol said Lisa Gay of Batesville was killed in the crash at Interstate 22 and Mississippi 309, WREG reported.

Taeâ€™ona Edmondson of Cape Coral, Florida, and Tanairy Portal of Miami, Florida, are in custody. MHP says the women face charges from multiple jurisdictions.

The incident began at 1 p.m. when the DeSoto County Sheriff's Deptartment attempted to stop a vehicle on U.S. 78, which turns into I-22. The suspect refused to stop and led deputies on a brief chase until they crossed into Marshall County.

DeSoto County deputies called the Marshall County Sheriff's Department, who picked up the chase. Deputies said Edmondson crashed her vehicle in Byhalia, killing Gay. Edmondson then got into another vehicle driven by Portal, who had been traveling with her, and the two continued to flee from law enforcement officers.

The pair crossed into Union County, where authorities there picked up the chase. The pursuit ended when Edmondson and Portal's vehicle struck an MHP vehicle head-on.

The two women and the trooper were transported to a hospital with minor injuries. MHP said Edmondson was the driver in both crashes.
