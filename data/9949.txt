A man killed by Tucson police on March 10 was shot seven times — once with a shotgun — and was bitten by a police dog, an autopsy report shows.

A total of 53 shots were fired by seven Tucson police officers at Nicholas Johnson as he tried to run over one of the officers in an apartment complex parking lot on the city’s southeast side, officials said.

Johnson, 22, died at University Medical Center. A toxicology report showed Johnson tested positive for methamphetamine, cocaine, benzoylecgonine, alcohol, and cannabinoid at the time of his death, according to the autopsy results released by the Pima County Medical Examiner’s Office.

Police officers approached the vehicle Johnson was driving in an apartment complex parking lot near East 30th Street and South Woodland Avenue after it had been connected to a carjacking and armed robbery March 9, police said.Johnson and another man in the stolen car, Roger Wells, 25, were wanted in connection with a carjacking and armed robbery.

Wells was arrested at the scene and booked into Pima County jail. He's facing charges of armed robbery, aggravated robbery and aggravated assault with a firearm.

The officer who was hit by the car was about to take Wells into custody when Johnson rapidly drove in reverse, police said.

The officer got entangled in the rear driver's side door, which was partially open, and was dragged for a short distance before he fell to the ground.

Police had responded to a carjacking involving two gunmen at a pharmacy nearby and at a Circle K, where police say Wells was seen leaving in a car similar to the one carjacked earlier. Officers later found the stolen car at the apartment complex where the shooting occurred.

The Pima County Attorney's Office and a Police Department board of inquiry are still reviewing the incident.
