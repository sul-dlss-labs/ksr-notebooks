MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - Authorities are releasing the identity of a man killed in a fatal police chase early Friday morning.

Twenty-nine year old Sean Calvin Terry of Montgomery was killed after he lead police on a high speed chase through downtown Montgomery.

Terry lost control of the Chevy Malibu he was driving and it slammed into a utility pole near the intersection of Madison Avenue and Coosa Street.

He was pronounced dead on the scene.

Montgomery police say the event started when they were called to the 1,500 block of Valleybrooke Lane on reports of domestic violence.

When officers arrived on the scene they say Terry's wife claimed that during a verbal argument he fired a gun.

The wife was taken to police headquarters to file an domestic violence warrant and a lookout was issued for her husband's car.

Just before 4am officers spotted Terry's vehicle and tried to pull the driver over.

Terry sped away, police say, and the pursuit exceeded 100 miles per hour.

The crash is still under investigation by the Alabama Bureau of Investigation, a routine procedure when law enforcement are involved in a death situation.
