An Arizona woman was shot and killed Tuesday night after she allegedly used a knife to attack deputies responding to a domestic call at her home.

Melissa Ventura, 24, of Yuma was shot shortly after she opened the door of her home, according to the Yuma Sun. Although police and paramedics provided first aid as soon as possible, she later died at Yuma Regional Medical Center.

The newspaper reports that deputies went to Ventura's home on a domestic call and knocked on the door. Ventura opened the door with a knife in hand and immediately began attacking them.

It was not clear why Ventura attacked the deputies, but court records show a history of arrests, the latest in 2014 including a conviction for aggravated domestic violence. The Sun reports that the records indicate Ventura had a history of mental illness.

Local NBC affiliate KYMA reports that Ventura had three children, including a 2-month-old.

"I don't know what happened. She was mother of three, and she lived for her kids," her sister Tiffany Ventura told KYMA. "She was the heart and soul of my family. I don't know what we are going to do without her; the only thing I can say is that her kids will know how much she loved them."

Results of the investigation into the police shooting will go to the Yuma County Attorney's Office to determine if the shooting was justified.

The deputies, who were not injured, have been placed on administrative leave.
