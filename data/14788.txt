WICHITA, Kan. — Wichita police say two people died when the stolen motorcycle they were riding collided with a vehicle.

Police identified the dead on Monday as Matthew K. Tanges and Angela M. Watson, both 26. Wichita police Lt. Todd Ojile said a Sedgwick County sheriff’s deputy was following the motorcycle late Sunday but was not actively pursuing it. The speeding motorcycle ran a stop sign and a light before hitting the vehicle. Tanges and Watson were thrown off the motorcycle and later died at a Wichita hospital. The driver of the car was not injured. Ojile says the motorcycle was stolen last week. The Wichita Eagle reports Department of Corrections records indicate Tanges was convicted of fleeing/attempting to elude law enforcement three times since 2006.
