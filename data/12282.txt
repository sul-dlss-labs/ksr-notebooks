WOODLAND PARK, Colo. (AP) - A driver who was shot by a Woodland Park police officer has died.

The 4th Judicial District Attorney's Office identified the driver Wednesday as 20-year-old Craig Bondo of Colorado Springs.

The shooting happened Tuesday afternoon after Woodland Park officers stopped a vehicle on U.S. 24.

Prosecutors say officers were talking with the driver when they learned the vehicle had been reported stolen out of Colorado Springs. Prosecutors say the driver allegedly struck one of officers with the vehicle when they tried to detain him. Shots were fired, and the driver was struck. He was taken to a hospital where he later died.

The officer involved in the shooting has been placed on routine administrative leave.

Prosecutors are reviewing the shooting.
