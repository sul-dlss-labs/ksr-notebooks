A man shot by a Pine Ridge tribal police officer earlier this month inside a hospital emergency room has died from his injuries.

The Rapid City Journal reports that the FBI identified the dead man as Jamie Brave Heart, a member of the Oglala Sioux tribe.

The shooting happened June 3 in the emergency room at the Indian Health Service hospital in Pine Ridge.

Tribal President John Yellow Bird Steele says Brave Heart allegedly stabbed the officer while under police custody and waiting for a medical evaluation.

Yellow Bird Steele said he did not know the wounded officer's medical status.

FBI spokesman Kyle Loven says that agency and the Bureau of Indian Affairs continue to investigate. They have not identified the officer.
