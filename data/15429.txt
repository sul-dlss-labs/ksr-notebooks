Man dies in crash following police chase on I-64 Police say alcohol was not a factor in the crash. The Indian River Road exit was closed for almost four hours while Virginia State Troopers investigated the crash.

Sherman Rodney Brown, 25, was killed early Sunday morning when his car crashed into a tree following a police chase on Interstate 64 just before 3:30 a.m. A state trooper observed Brown in a 2013 Toyota Camry going over 100 mph on I-64 east. The Trooper initiated a traffic stop but before the Trooper could complete the stop, Brown sped off at high speed. Brown tried to take the Indian River Road exit but lost control of the vehicle and hit a tree. He died at the crash site. Brown was not wearing a seat belt.
