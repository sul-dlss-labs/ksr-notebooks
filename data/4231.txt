A 75-year-old man – who friends say was hard of hearing and had poor eyesight – was shot dead by police after he allegedly pointed a loaded 12-gauge shotgun at officers during a drug raid at his Long Island home.

Little Booker raised the cocked shotgun to his shoulder and pointed the weapon at a group of cops standing in his second-floor bedroom Friday night in Wyandanch, police said.

An officer, who was not identified, shot Booker twice in the torso. Booker was declared dead at the scene around 11 p.m.

Suffolk homicide Detective Sgt. Edward Fandrey said the shooting was within law-enforcement guidelines.

“It appears that the shooting officer acted prudently. There was a gun pointed at him and he terminated the threat,” Fandrey said, adding Booker was not the intended target of the bust.

But the shooting outraged startled neighbors, forcing police to close off Patton Avenue, where the search warrant was executed.

“They came in here acting like dogs. He was an old man in his bedroom,” said the dead man’s son’s wife, Tina Dennis, who was one of five people inside the house at the time of the shooting.

Cops had executed a “no knock” search warrant to arrest Booker’s son Kenny Dennis, 41, for allegedly selling crack cocaine to an undercover officer.

Dennis was arrested at the scene along with another resident of the house, Tracey McDuffie, on a drug-possession charge.
