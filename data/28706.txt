A man was arrested by Oklahoma City police on Sunday after a crash killed one man near SW 29th and Villa Avenue.

The man who died was involved in a pursuit and had a 19-year-old passenger, police said.

Twisted metal and bits and pieces of a car was all that was left of the fatal crash at the southwest Oklahoma City intersection.

Police had to close down the street on Sunday to investigate the crash that killed 41-year-old Randy Sproles and left his teenage passenger with minor injuries.

Just before the crash, an officer attempted to pull Sproles over on a traffic stop.

“The vehicle failed to stop for the officer and initiated a pursuit, which eventually led them northbound to SW 29th Street,” said Sgt. Megan Morgan, Oklahoma City Police Department.

Police said Sproles blew through the stop sign at SW 29th and Villa Avenue at the same time 20-year-old Jose Medrano-Carrillo's truck was headed westbound.

“The driver traveling westbound hit the suspect vehicle,” said Morgan. “Ultimately, ended up killing the driver of the suspect vehicle.”

While Sproles did not survive the crash, Medrano-Carrillo was taken to a local hospital.

Police found open beer cans in Medrano-Carrillo's pickup and officers noted he smelled like alcohol and had watery, bloodshot eyes.

The police report stated an officer, who responded to the crash scene, saw Medrano-Carrillo street racing just before the deadly crash.

“It’s unknown at this time if speed ended up being a factor in that, but again, the incident is under investigation,” Morgan said.

He was arrested on complaints of DUI, driving without a state license and first-degree manslaughter.

The case will go to the Oklahoma County district attorney’s office where prosecutors will decide if Medrano-Carrillo will be charged.
