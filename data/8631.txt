The police said the three officers in the chase fired 14 shots among them. The officers were not identified. They were part of a gang unit, a law enforcement official said.

One bullet was found in the side of a house and another in a sport utility vehicle.

“They got him in the back of the legs, the shoulder, the feet, it was all over,” said Theresa Boyke-Richards, a friend of Mr. Vasconcellos’s family. “They told him to stop, he got nervous because the other two kids got thrown to the ground, so he got scared and started running.”

Leaner Cannon, the mother of Derby Michel, 18, one of the two men accompanying Mr. Vasconcellos, said that he carried the gun for self-defense, not to shoot officers. “He kept it in his book bag; he’s just using it for protection,” she said, adding that her son remained in custody on Sunday.

Mr. Vasconcellos was enrolled in a program at Jamaica High School and was going to a house party when the shooting occurred, according to Ms. Boyke-Richards. He had a younger brother and had lived with his girlfriend and her mother in Rosedale, Queens, for about two years, said Ms. Boyke-Richards.

“He was trying to keep away from this, the project, and look where he got killed,” said Ms. Boyke-Richards, standing outside the housing project on West 40th Street where Mr. Vasconcellos’s mother lives.
