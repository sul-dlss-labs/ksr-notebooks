SCRANTON, Pa. -- A police standoff on Grace Street in Scranton lasted for two and a half hours, and it ended with the Lackawanna County Coroner's Office saying the man took his own life.

Law enforcement officers and members of the SWAT team suited up in heavy gear for the standoff starting around 3 p.m. Tuesday.

Neighbors watched and worried as police investigated.

“People from the whole neighborhood were out here watching, and everyone was just curious I guess for the most part to make sure there were no kids in the house,” neighbor James Furman said.

Neighbors said they weren't completely shocked when they saw all the police activity at this house because they say there have been problems there in the past.

“They're usually always fighting. There's always something going on over there,” neighbor Martha Pringle said.

“Shortly after I moved here there was an incident where the police were here, but not as drastic as it was tonight. But indeed, last summer there was also an incident,” Furman said.

“His neighbor just moved out because of him, and now a new one just moved in this week. They don't know what he's about, now they do, poor people,” neighbor Chris Patterson said.

When police went into the home, they found the man dead. No one else was inside the house.

Neighbors said the man was in his 40s and he had three kids, but he wasn’t exactly friendly.

“He was mean. He was a mean guy. We had a couple of run-ins with him, but I didn't know something like this would happen,” Pringle said.

Police in Scranton are continuing their investigation.
