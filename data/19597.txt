NEWARK -- The man killed in a fiery crash early Monday as police chased him in a stolen car was identified Wednesday as an 18-year-old East Orange resident, authorities said.

Shakur Loyal was driving a stolen Jaguar FX through Newark at high speed at 4:25 a.m. Monday when Newark police officers tried to pull him over, acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn A. Murray said Wednesday.

The car had been reported stolen out of Bridgewater, Murray said.

During the chase, Loyal lost control of the car, hit two unoccupied parked cars, and sheered a utility pole, Murray said. The Jaguar burst into flames near the intersection of Irvine Turner Boulevard and Clinton Avenue, Murray said.

The Essex County Prosecutor's Office is investigating the crash, and its Professional Standards Bureau will review the actions of the officers in the chase, authorities said.

Friends and family members took to social media to express grief over Loyal's death.
