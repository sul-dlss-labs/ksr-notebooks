Police say Meadows ditched his bicycle and fled on foot. One of the officers running closest to Meadows observed the suspect holding an object under his shirt and told him to stop.

According to police, Meadows fell to the ground and dropped a .40 caliber pistol, and the officer ordered him not to touch the firearm. Police say Meadows then grabbed the weapon and fired at the two officers, who then returned fire.
