AUBURN — A police officer shot and killed a Bucksport man Monday morning near the Value Inn on Center St., Auburn Police Chief Jason Moen said during a news conference Monday afternoon.

Moen said that around 10 a.m., police received a report of a female being held against her will at the inn at 170 Center St. According to Moen, police had to force their way into the room and found the occupants had fled out a window.

Sgt. Steven Gosselin encountered a man police later identified as Joseph Arbour, 36, of Bucksport, in the inn parking lot. After attempting to speak with Arbour, an “armed confrontation” occurred after a short foot pursuit, Moen said.

Gosselin fired three shots at Arbour, who died at the scene.

The Attorney General’s Office is investigating the incident, and the Police Department is opening its own investigation.

Gosselin, a 24-year veteran of the department, has been placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.
