Two police officers involved in a shooting Sunday night in Seymour that left a 43-year-old Beech Grove man dead have been placed on administrative leave.

The investigation into the incident, reported at 8:30 p.m., that left Jason S. Cline dead shows he pointed a handgun at the officers while they were trying to arrest him for possessing stolen property, according to a news release from Sgt. Stephen Wheeles with the Indiana State Police Versailles Post.

The names of the two Seymour officers were not released, but protocol requires them to be placed on administrative leave while the investigation is ongoing, Police Chief Bryant Lucas said.

The incident started after police responded to a report of theft at Walmart Supercenter at 1600 E. Tipton St. Police arriving in the area found a man, later identified as Cline, with a shopping cart containing suspected stolen items near the Speedway convenience store at 1509 E. Tipton St., Wheeles said.

As police approached Cline, he fled west and then north across Tipton Street and into a deep ditch in front of the Taco Bell restaurant, police said.

The officers caught up to Cline, Wheeles said, and while attempting to place him in handcuffs, Cline resisted and pointed a gun at the officers, who both fired their guns, hitting Cline.

The officers provided aid to Cline, who also had gone by the names of Jason Tabor and Jason Tabor Cline in the past, before he was taken to Schneck Medical Center, where he died as a result of his injuries, Wheeles said.

He said the gun Cline pointed at police was loaded and had been reported stolen.

An autopsy was conducted on Cline on Wednesday, and toxicology results are pending.
