Fredonia - A Jackson man who killed himself after a five-hour standoff with police at his wife's Fredonia home was "a very angry man" who was going through a divorce and, along with his wife, had just been foreclosed on the day before, court records show.

Max Bishop, 33, who ran a car-customizing shop, shot himself in the head with a sawed-off shotgun shortly before 9 p.m. Thursday as officers with the Ozaukee County special response team moved in, the county's Sheriff's Department said Friday.

Bishop, who bought the shotgun Thursday, arrived at the house in the 400 block of Emerald Hills Drive just before 3 p.m., according to the department. Armed with the shotgun and carrying a gas can, he kicked in the front door and "began to confront his wife regarding their failed marriage," a department statement says.

Bishop used the gasoline to start a fire in the basement and a bedroom, the department said.

While he was setting the fires, his wife escaped and called 911 from a neighbor's house.

At the end of the standoff, deputies approached the house and found Bishop dead on a patio.

"He's a very angry man," his wife had said in her petition for a restraining order, which was granted.
