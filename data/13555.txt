THE DALLES â€” The man shot to death by a police officer in Wishram, Wash., has been identified by the Klickitat County prosecutor as 22-year-old Adrian Suarez of The Dalles. He was a suspect in a rape case.

When officers from Washington and Oregon went to a house to question Suarez Wednesday night, he was fatally shot by a plainclothes officer from The Dalles in a shootout as he attempted to flee.

The 42-year-old officer was wounded. He was treated at Mid-Columbia Medical Center in The Dalles and released Thursday.

KLCK reports he is a 17-year-old police veteran.
