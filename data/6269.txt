A San Angelo man, who doused himself with gasoline then caught fire after police used a stun gun on him, died Monday from his injuries.

Hospital officials in Lubbock confirm the death of Juan Flores Lopez. Relatives say Lopez, 47, had a history of mental illness.

San Angelo police say they used pepper spray while trying to take Lopez into custody. He was not handcuffed. Lieutenant Curtis Milbourn says Lopez had a can of gas and a lighter in his hand at one point. Milbourn says Lopez tossed gas at officers, but no one was hurt.

Texas Rangers are investigating whether a lighter found at the scene could have contributed to the fire and whether a taser can ignite anything.

Two of the man's sons say Lopez had threatened for months, to burn himself and his house. His wife was seeking a divorce and he didn't want to leave the residence.
