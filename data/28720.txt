AUBURN GRESHAM — A 10-year-old girl was killed and a 5-year-old boy seriously injured Wednesday afternoon after police say a driver fleeing a traffic stop crashed with two cars.

The fatal crash happened about 12:30 p.m. in the 8000 block of South Halsted Street in the Gresham neighborhood, police said.

Officers tried to pull over a driver for unspecified traffic violations when the driver fled, going west on 80th Street, police said.

The driver crashed twice, hitting a 57-year-old woman driving north on Halsted and then hitting another car stopped on 80th Street and seriously injuring two children, police said. Three people in the fleeing car ran off.

Paramedics took the children to Comer Children’s Hospital, where the 10-year-old girl was pronounced dead. The 5-year-old boy is in critical condition, police said.

The 43-year-old man driving the car with the children and the 57-year-old woman were taken to University of Chicago Medical Center. Both are in good condition, police said.

No one is in custody, but detectives are speaking to a person of interest. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability and the Chicago Police Major Accidents Investigation Unit are investigating.

“This is a devastating loss of life, and our sincerest condolences go out to the family and all those impacted by this tragic incident,” police said in a statement.
