The man accused of shooting two people, one fatally, in San Diego last week killed himself in Texas, police said Monday.

Thanh “Tony” Pham, 34, of San Diego, took his own life on Sunday when he was located at a Houston hotel by deputies from the Harris County Sheriff’s Department, San Diego police homicide Lt. Mike Hastings said in a statement.

The statement did not say how Pham committed suicide. Questions were referred to Texas authorities, who had not yet responded to queries about the incident.

San Diego police on Friday issued a warrant for Pham’s arrest in the Nov. 11 shootings on 54th Place near Orange Avenue in El Cerrito. A woman, Thuy Nguyen, 42, died at a hospital. A 36-year-old man survived. His name has not been released.

San Diego police found the victims after responding about 4:45 p.m. to calls about shots being fired. Witnesses said the shootings followed an argument. The assailant fled in a car after shooting both people in the torso, Hastings said.

Pham was the only suspect, Hastings said. It was not yet determined if the incident was gang related, the lieutenant said earlier.
