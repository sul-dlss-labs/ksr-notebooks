Gunfire blasted through a celebrated community event in Trenton early Sunday morning leaving one person dead and 22 injured, police said.

The 24-hour Art All Night event is meant to honor local artists and held at the historic Roebling Wire Works building on South Clinton Avenue.

The shooting erupted around 2:45 a.m. Authorities said the shooting did not appear to be a targeted incident but a gang-related dispute that eventually led to an exchange of gunfire with police. Multiple weapons were recovered at the scene, authorities said.

One dead

One of the suspected shooters, identified as Tahaji Wells, is dead, according to Mercer County Prosecutor Angelo Onofri. The 33-year-old man was shot and killed by police after allegedly exchanging fire with at least two other suspects, Onofri said.

Amir Armstrong and another suspect who has not been identified, are in the hospital in critical and stable condition, respectively, authorities said.

The unknowns

It's still unclear what prompted the shooting but prior to the burst of gunfire, fights broke out inside and outside the building. Police said the suspects first shot at each other before police opened fire.

Witnesses who spoke to NJ Advance Media say they heard shots fired inside the building first before the gunfire migrated outside.

"I'm still in shock, all that happened all around me," Edward "NJ Weednman" Forchion, who was at the event Saturday night and took videos of the scene, said.

He said he was passing out flyers and taking photos when “all hell broke loose.” Forchion said he heard 26 shots. The gunfire started inside the building and then continued outside, he said.

“There were people that fell and people stepped over them, people that ran into cars, people were scrambling,” he said.

"The events in Trenton are tragic, but the actions of the Trenton Police officers is heroic. They faced suspects shooting at each other with no care for innocent people around them. Officers engaged the active shooters to stop the senseless violence," President Patrick Colligan. — New Jersey State PBA (@NJSPBA) June 17, 2018

'Best of Trenton'

Organizers of the Art All Night event could not be reached on Sunday. But the event, now in its 12th year draws thousands.

“I’ve gone to this event for several years. I’ve been going for the past several years, never anything like this,” Maurice Lennon, 31, said. “I’ve always bragged that this is Trenton’s best event … it’s always peaceful, I’ve always felt safe.”

Trenton's mayor-elect, state Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-15th Dist.), issued a statement saying he attended Art All Night Saturday, and was unsure about the popular event's future.

"I hope that Art All Night does continue but we are going to have to reevaluate security measures in the future," he said. "It will be a top priority of my administration to make Trenton a safer city."

'Everyone started running'

Lennon, of Trenton, said he wanted to get one last look at the art inside the building with his friend when he heard gunfire.

“We heard the first shots ring out inside the art gallery. The first shot, then the second shot before it resonated that: Wow that’s gunfire,” Lennon, of Trenton said in a phone interview Sunday.

“You saw the doors bust open, everyone starting running out and panicking. I ended up getting tripped and fell and I ended up crawling.”

Lennon said he has cuts on his legs and arms from crawling and being stepped on by other people fleeing the shooting.

13-year-old hurt

Of the 22 victims, 17 were injured by gunfire, authorities said. The youngest victim is a 13-year-old boy who is now in stable condition, authorities said.

Seventeen people, including 13 with gunshot wounds, were taken to Capital Health Regional Medical Center in Trenton, spokeswoman Kate Stier said. Four of the victims were in critical condition but are now stable; one of the alleged gunman was declared dead at the hospital, she said.

None of the surviving victims had been released as of 11:20 a.m., but Stier said some are expected to be released later Sunday.

One victim was taken to Cooper University Health Care, according to a spokeswoman.

Pow, pow, pow

Irvin Higgenbotham, a resident who said he comes to the event every year, was shot in the leg early Sunday morning. Higgenbotham said he was walking inside the event with his bike when he heard the shots going off. "It was like, pow, pow, pow and then I was laying down on the ground," he said.

A bullet struck his leg, he said, and a woman who was at the event helped him until he was able to be treated. Higgenbotham returned to the scene of the shooting at about 8:45 a.m. Sunday, after being released from the hospital, to find out what happened, and how he got caught in the middle of the shooting, he said.

The shooting comes four days after Gov. Phil Murphy signed among the strictest gun laws in the country.

The governor spoke during a Sunday service at the Galilee Baptist Church in Trenton and urged the community to "rise above it."

"It's yet another reminder of the senseless gun violence, even having signed six stringent gun laws last week," Murphy said. "We know we're getting stronger and better but we're a long way from getting rid of this senselessness."
