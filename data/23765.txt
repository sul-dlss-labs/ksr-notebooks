The Arapahoe County Coroner’s Office has identified the man shot to death on Saturday by an Aurora police officer as Troy Michael Jacques.

Jacques, 41, died of multiple gunshot wounds, the coroner’s office said in a news release Tuesday. His death has been classified as a homicide.

Jacques pulled a gun on officers during a traffic stop near the intersection of East Smoky Hill Road and South Mobile Way, police officials said Monday during a news conference. The officers had pulled him over because his car matched the description of a car that had been involved in a road rage incident on Friday night.

A couple had reported to Aurora police on Friday night that a strange man had brandished a gun at them on I-225 near the East Mississippi Avenue interchange. The couple told police the threat was unprovoked, and the man had followed them for awhile.

The couple had provided a description of the car and the suspect, but officers were unable to find him.

The officers who pulled over Jacques were the same officers who had taken the report on Friday, Aurora police said.

When they pulled Jacques over, he advanced on them and ignored orders to stop before returning to his car to get a semi-automatic handgun, police said. An Aurora Police Department officer tried to physically take down Jacques, but fired his handgun when Jacques pointed his weapon, police said.

The shooting remains under investigation. The officer who fired the shot has not been identified.

Jacques was the seventh person to be killed by Colorado law enforcement since Jan. 1. There have been a total of 13 officer-involved shootings in 2018, and two sheriff’s deputies also have been killed in those incidents.
