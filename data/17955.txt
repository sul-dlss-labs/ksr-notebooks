SAN ANTONIO â€“ A 34-year-old man who was wounded in an officer-involved shooting on the city's West Side has died.

The man was identified as Steven Alfred Longoria, police said.

The shooting was reported around 2:30 a.m. Saturday at a home in the 100 block of Olga Street.

Police Chief William McManus said that when officers arrived at the home to investigate a report of family violence, Longoria opened fire on the officers. A police cruiser was struck by one of the gunshots, McManus said.

Two officers returned fire, hitting Longoria in the chest, McManus said. Longoria was taken to University Hospital in critical condition. He later died.

Longoria's 28-year-old girlfriend, whom McManus said was involved in an argument with the suspect, suffered a gunshot wound to her leg.

The officers who opened fire on Longoria were expected to be placed on administrative duty pending the outcome of the investigation.
