A New Hampshire woman died in a violent single-car crash early Sunday morning while fleeing police in Charlton County.

Amanda Darling, 29, of Derry, N.H., was pronounced dead at the scene. A passenger, Alissa Brown, 26, of Atkinson, N.H., was airlifted to Shands Hospital in Jacksonville.

The Georgia State Patrol's Waycross Post investigated the accident. The fatality was reported by the State Patrol on Monday but details were withheld pending completion of the investigation, which was delayed because Brown provided false identification after the accident, the State Patrol's Donna Dismuke said.

Brown has been charged with several drug-related offenses and possession of a fraudulent driver's license and likely faces other charges as well, according to the State Patrol.

She was released from the hospital and has not been incarcerated.

Darling and Brown were traveling east in the westbound lane of Georgia 40 at Mile Marker 2 in a 2003 Chevrolet Impala when the accident occurred just after midnight, post commander Sgt. 1st Class Terry Thrift wrote in his accident report. They were being pursued by units of the Kingsland Police Department after being clocked going 100 mph in the southbound lane of I-95, Kingsland Police Inspector Richard Sapp said. They left I-95 at Exit 3 and Kingsland police continued pursuit onto Georgia 40.

Darling lost control of the car when the right-side tires went off the road and the car went into a spin. The car then left the road completely, traveled through a ditch and "continued through the clear-cut to the woodline while flipping, rotating and overturning multiple times."

Darling and Brown were ejected from the vehicle.

GSP's Special Crash Reconstruction Team continues to investigate the accident.
