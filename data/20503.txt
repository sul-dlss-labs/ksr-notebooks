OSHKOSH, Wis. - A 42-year-old man who died last fall hours after police used an electric stun gun on him actually died from the effects of cocaine intoxication, the Winnebago County coroner has ruled.

Barry Busby ruled Friday in the case of Marcus Roach-Burruss, who died last Sept. 17 about 13 hours after he a Taser was used on him following a disturbance at the Wal-Mart in Neenah.

The coroner said the death was caused by excited delirium syndrome, which takes place when the heart races wildly from an abundance of adrenaline and finally gives out.

Police have said they used the Taser on Roach-Burruss after he caused a disturbance and attacked three employees at the Wal-Mart.

"The police didn't do anything wrong," Busby said.

"Police acted in defense of protecting citizens, themselves and the decedent."

Neenah Police Chief Ray Appel said the officers involved previously had been cleared of any wrongdoing. He said store video security cameras supported their actions.

"This was one where they followed protocol to a 't.' We did everything we could," he said of officers' attempts to subdue the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Roach-Burruss. "Using the Taser was unfortunately the only thing we could do."

The coroner also ruled recently that Fernando Alonso Maldonado Sr., 26, who died after he was struck by a car July 31 along Wisconsin 441, died from excited delirium, and not from injuries he suffered in the crash.

Busby did not release the exact amounts of cocaine found in the men's systems, but said "they both had enough to cause a problem."
