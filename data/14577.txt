Man in police gun battle killed himself, coroner says

A man involved in a shootout with Metro Police after a robbery and high-speed chase last week killed himself during the confrontation, according to the Clark County Coroner’s Office.

Danny Michael Wadsworth Jr. pulled a gun and started firing at officers on Sahara Avenue near Interstate 15 on the night of May 30, according to Metro Police officials. The Clark County Coroner’s Office said today that Wadsworth, 31, subsequently died from a single, self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

Earlier in the evening, Wadsworth had stolen purses from two women at Town Square mall, police alleged.

Police tracked him using one of the women’s stolen cell phones. They found him near I-15 and Sahara, where he had collided with another vehicle while driving the wrong way on Sahara, police said.

Wadsworth pulled a gun and started firing at officers, and the officers fired back, police said.

Metro identified the patrol officers involved in the shooting as Jeffrey Gentry and Bryce Martines.

Gentry, 45, has been with Metro since 1999, and Martines 27, has worked at Metro since 2008. Both officers were placed on routine paid administrative leave while the shooting is reviewed.
