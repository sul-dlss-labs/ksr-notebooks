SAN MATEO â€“ Police were investigating a murder suicide after a care home worker shot a co-worker to death Monday morning, then went home and engaged officers in a stalemate for several hours before fatally shooting himself, authorities said.

The violent sequence began about 7:20 a.m. with a report of a shooting at a care home on the 1700 block of Pierce Street, according to San Mateo police. Responding officers found a 42-year-old man gravely injured with gunshot injuries, and he was pronounced dead.

Police said that within minutes of the attack, they tracked the suspected gunman to his home on the 1600 block of Marina Court. Crisis negotiators and the regional SWAT team were summoned to the scene and tried to coax the shooting suspect into surrendering.

But at 12:12 p.m., police said, the 48-year-old man died by suicide after shooting himself. His wife, who had been inside the home for the duration of the episode, was not injured.

Employees at the care home told police the suspect and the victim were co-workers, and the motive for the shooting appeared to have been over a dating relationship they both shared with a woman.

Anyone with information for investigators or security footage related to the case can contact Detective Sgt. Lee Violett at 650-522-7662 or lviolett@cityofsanmateo.org, or leave a tip at 650-522-7676 or http://tinyurl.com/SMPDTips.
