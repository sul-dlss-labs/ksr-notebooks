Osceola County deputies shot and killed a man after they say he pointed his gun at them in a neighborhood near St. Cloud Tuesday morning, a sheriff’s spokesman said.

Deputies have not released the man’s name.

A woman called 911 just before 9:20 a.m. Tuesday to say a man in a home on Cinder Lane, near East Lake Tohopekaliga, was suicidal and had a handgun, said Major Jacob Ruiz, an Osceola County sheriff’s spokesman.

Deputies came to the house, on a street sparsely populated with homes. The woman got out safely and deputies called a SWAT unit and crisis negotiator to talk to the man, Ruiz said.

About 11:40 a.m. the man pointed his gun at deputies, Ruiz said. Deputies responded by shooting him, Ruiz said.

The man was taken to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the shooting, as is protocol, Ruiz said.

The five deputies in the SWAT unit that responded are on paid administrative leave, Ruiz said. He said he did not know how many deputies fired their weapons, and that it will be part of the FDLE investigation.
