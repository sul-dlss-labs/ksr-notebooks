BOULDER, Colo. (AP) â€” A Las Vegas man who died of a suspected suicide after being pulled over in Colorado had been reported missing and possibly in "extreme emotional distress" last month.

The Daily Camera reports that Boulder police officer stopped a car driven by 25-year-old Kevin Flecha on Monday because it had suspected stolen license plates. After it was stopped, the officer heard a gunshot. SWAT officers were called to the scene and calls were made to 229 nearby homes to warn them of the situation.

Flecha was found dead of a gunshot inside the car.

Police spokeswoman Shannon Aulabaugh said no officers fired and the gunshot appears to be self-inflicted.

While she said the license plates may have been stolen, the car belonged to Flecha.

The coroner will conduct an autopsy and investigation into his death.
