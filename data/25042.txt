PARKVILLE, MD â€” Police said a man died after being shot by an off-duty police officer Monday night in the parking lot of a Baltimore County shopping center. Authorities said the man had been driving erratically and either dragged the officer or hit him with his SUV before the policeman fired his service weapon.

The shooting occurred in the 2400 block of Cleanleigh Drive around 8:30 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 29, police reported. Derrick Alexander Sellman, 28, of the 2300 block of Walshire Avenue in Baltimore, was pronounced deceased at Sinai Hospital, authorities reported at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Oct. 30.

Based on the preliminary investigation, authorities said the officer, who was working at his second job, was informed about a black SUV driving erratically in the parking lot at the Parkway Crossing shopping center.

While the officer was speaking with the driver, later identified as Sellman, the SUV "either dragged the officer or struck him, causing the officer to be struck by another vehicle traveling in the opposite direction of the SUV," police said in a statement.



The officer fired his gun at least once, hitting Sellman, who continued driving and hit a parked car before the SUV became disabled in the parking lot near the Home Depot, according to officials. Nobody else was in the SUV besides the driver, police reported.

Sellman was taken to Sinai Hospital in grave condition with a gunshot wound to the upper body, police reported Monday night, and he succumbed to his injury. The officer was taken to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center for treatment of injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. Police said the officer had been released from the hospital after being treated for his injuries, as of Tuesday, Oct. 30.
