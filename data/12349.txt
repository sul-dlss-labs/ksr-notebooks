DOWLING, MI --

Ralph Elliott III fired two shots from a .32 caliber handgun, one of them to his own head, before

, according to the lead investigator.

Michigan State Police Detective First Lt. Chuck Christensen said Elliott, 41, was armed with two handguns before officers arrived at 9840 Banfield Road near Dowling on a domestic assault complaint.

Elliott voluntarily turned over one of the guns to his wife but then pulled a second .32-caliber handgun, according to a news release from Christensen issued late Wednesday afternoon.

Elliott then fired a shot into the driveway before firing a "non-lethal, self-inflicted shot into the head area," according to Christensen's statement.

When Barry County deputies responded to the scene, they set up a perimeter around the house, and began trying to talk to Elliott who was inside the home, according to the release.

About 25 minutes later, Elliott exited the home and "ignored numerous verbal commands from the deputies to stop his approach toward them," Christensen said.

After a Taser deployment that did not subdue him, Elliott continued to disobey officers' commands and reached into his front pocket. It was at this time a deputy decided to use deadly force, according to Christensen.

At least one deputy fired five shots at Elliott with a .223-caliber patrol rifle and struck the him twice in the hip area, according to the news release. First aid was then given by officers and paramedics on scene.

Elliott later died at Pennock Hospital in Hastings.

Statements from two deputies during interviews with investigators are currently under review, Christensen said. Investigators are still awaiting the official autopsy report, toxicology report and ballistics findings.
