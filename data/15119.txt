Authorities released their report on a fatal motorcycle crash from late September.Police released photos of the crash site at Morningside and Comanche from the morning of Sept. 20. John Gurule died after his motorcycle slammed into a car and he hit a curb.Both investigators and attorneys for Gurule's family agree on how the incident ended, but are split on what led up to his death.Albuquerque police said they were not chasing Gurule."We simply don't chase a lot of people because it's too dangerous," Officer Tanner Tixier said.Attorneys for Gurule's family believe there was a chase prior to the crash.According to reports in the case, Officer Jared Frazier spotted Gurule on his motorcycle on Montgomery and San Mateo boulevards.Frazier suspected Gurule was drunk. The officer claims he was swerving. Frazier tried to pull him over, but instead of stopping, the officer said Gurule sped through a nearby neighborhood, ran a stop sign and slammed into a car."The family's concern was that APD had something to do with him traveling at the rate of speed he was traveling at, and that might be a factor in the cause of the accident," attorney Jerry Archuleta said.APD asked the Bernalillo County Sheriff's Department to investigate the case. According to a recently released report, Gurule had a long criminal history with multiple arrests that included drunken driving. His driver's license was revoked at the time of the crash.Multiple witnesses told investigators the officer was nearby but was not chasing Gurule."Unfortunately Mr. Gurule's own actions led to his untimely death," Tixier said.Target 7 also learned this isn't the first time Frazier has been questioned when it comes to pursuing someone on a motorcycle.Attorneys for the Gurule family said they plan to take their case to court.
