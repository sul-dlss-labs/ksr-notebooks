The man who authorities say attempted to rob a smoke shop and then died in a traffic collision as he fled law enforcement on Tuesday, March 24, has been identified as a 23-year-old Perris resident.

Gabriel Dominic Romero died at the scene of the collision on Ramona Expressway east of Hansen Avenue, the Riverside County Coroner’s Office said.

Deputies responding to a report of an attempted robbery in the 2200 block of West Esplanade Avenue just before 1:20 p.m. spotted Romero’s car and gave chase. After a brief pursuit, Romero lost control and crashed into a pickup, the Sheriff’s Department said.

The occupants of the pickup were hospitalized and were expected to survive.
