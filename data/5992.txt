Chicago police officials on Thursday ruled that an officer who shot and killed a suspect Wednesday afternoon on the North Side acted appropriately, spokeswoman Monique Bond said.

Police conducted a roundtable discussion of the shooting in the hours after the incident and concluded that the officer's "actions were in compliance with department guidelines," Bond said.

Ben Brown, 29, allegedly pulled a gun on police officers who confronted him outside a liquor store at Francisco and Devon Avenues. The officers suspected Brown was carrying a weapon, followed him into the store and a struggle ensued, according to authorities. When they returned to the street, Brown allegedly drew the gun from his pants and refused to drop it. Police shot him multiple times, authorities said.

Court records show Brown was on parole for a 1997 conviction for aggravated battery with a firearm.
