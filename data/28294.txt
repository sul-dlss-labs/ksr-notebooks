The man who was shot-to-death last month by Riverside County sheriff's deputies investigating an alleged break-in at a Palm Desert gun store was a 33-year-old Palm Desert resident, a sheriff's department spokeswoman said Wednesday.

His name was Aaron Solorio Granados, according to Sgt. Deanna Pecoraro.

Granados was killed outside C.V. Guns & Tackle, 41-945 Boardwalk, Suite R. No deputies were injured in the incident.

Authorities said the shooting occurred during an investigation into an alarm that had gone off at about 10:30 p.m. June 22 at a gun shop inside the Cook Corporate Center, an office park near the intersection of Cook Street and Hovley Lane East.

Once on scene, deputies discovered an unoccupied vehicle, a white sedan, which had been crashed into the building where the business is located.

Authorities believed the shop had been broken into and that a suspect or suspects were still in the store.

According to a sheriff's department news release, deputies surrounded the building and a man, armed with a firearm, exited the business, At some point during the incident, the suspect was shot by at least one deputy and died at the scene.

The sheriff's department's investigation into the shooting is ongoing, Pecoraro said Wednesday, adding that no additional details about what happened that night would be released.

Desert Sun requests to the sheriff's department for copies of footage recorded by the body-worn cameras of deputies at the scene of the incident have been denied by the department.
