A Denver police officer shot a suspect Friday night near Empower Field at Mile High after the individual fled a police stop, authorities said. The man, whose identity was not released, was transported to a hospital and on Saturday died from his injuries, police said.

Earlier Friday night, police noticed a car driving erratically and attempted to contact the driver, Division Chief Joseph Montoya said in a video news conference. When officers approached the car, the driver and one passenger fled and eventually were located in a parking lot near West Colfax Avenue and North Federal Boulevard.

When officers again approached the vehicle, one of the occupants took off running. During the foot pursuit, one officer shot the individual, Montoya said.

Montoya did not say whether the man fleeing from police had a weapon or fired at officers.

It is unclear what happened to the second person believed to be in the car.

The incident marks the fourth officer-involved shooting in Denver this year, the first since Jan. 25. Three people have been killed, and one was wounded.
