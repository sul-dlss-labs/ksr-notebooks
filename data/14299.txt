A man who fatally shot himself Friday in front of Omaha police officers had a history of domestic abuse and owed child support, according to Douglas County court records.

Police were called to 6546 Spencer St. shortly after 5 p.m. Friday, where they found Burdette Becks, 38, armed with a handgun.

According to police, Becks was standing outside the residence, saying he was going to kill himself. Officers tried to calm him down. Becks then fired one shot to his head and died.

Police had been called to the residence on the report of a domestic dispute. The woman at the home was in the process of obtaining a protection order against Becks, said Officer James Shade, a police spokesman.

The woman, Crystal L. Ludwig, requested the order in January on behalf of herself and her 3-year-old daughter, according to court records. In that request, she said Becks had tried to kill himself several times in the past year and that he had sent harassing texts to her and made harassing phone calls.

She obtained a protection order against Becks in October 2012. At the joint request of Ludwig and Becks, the order was lifted by a judge in December of that year.

As recently as March 5, Becks was ordered by the Douglas County District Court to pay child support to Ludwig. Becks also was ordered to pay child support to her in 2012.

In 2002, another woman filed for a protection order against Becks, court records show. The woman began seeking child support from Becks starting in 2001.

Because Becks shot himself in the presence of police officers, the shooting is being treated as an in-custody death.

Shade has said that the shooting was captured on cruiser camera and that no officers discharged their weapons.
