The police said the sisters lived in Britain, but did not say where, or where they had lived before in France.

Officer Varon was placed on administrative leave while the accident was under investigation. He was not using a siren, and witnesses said the women had not seen his vehicle coming.

The accident was seen by hundreds of people, The Miami Herald reported. Witnesses said that after the two-ton vehicle ran over the women lengthwise, it backed up over them again. Then, because the vehicle was still over one of the women, it moved again, crushing her chest, the newspaper said.

''Officer Varon is quite distraught,'' said Capt. George Navarro of the Miami Beach police.

Officials said the incident began with the report that two men had robbed an in-line skater near the beach. A lifeguard then reported seeing a man who fit one of the descriptions, leading the police to start searching the beach.

As many as a dozen police vehicles were trailing Officer Varon's vehicle when the women were hit.

Anthony Holdgate of Essex, England, was lying on the sand today near where the sisters had been struck. He said people now appeared to be more cautious when driving on the beach.
