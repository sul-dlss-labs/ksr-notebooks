Orlando police say Andre Howard is the detective who shot and killed a burglary suspect while serving an arrest warrant Thursday morning.

Howard and Officer Antonio Shorter, who was with him at the time, were both placed on paid administrative leave following the on-duty shooting death of 32-year-old Alejandro Cordero-Rivera.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting. The probe will determine if the officers acted appropriately in the deadly incident.

Officials say Howard has been an Orlando police officer since 1999. He is assigned to the criminal investigations division. Shorter is a patrol officer who joined the force in 2012.

Police say the two officers went to Cordero-Rivera’s home on Soria Avenue in a gated community near Semoran Boulevard about 11:20 a.m. Thursday to follow up on an investigation into a recent burglary case.

Cordero-Rivera has served two prison terms after past burglary convictions. He was released from prison in May, Department of Corrections records show.

When the officers arrived, they found Cordero-Rivera was sitting in a car in the driveway of his home. When Shorter and Howard walked to the car, they both saw the suspect with a gun.

That’s when Howard opened fire on the suspect. Shorter did not fire his gun, police say.

Cordero-Rivera was taken to Florida Hospital East, where he later died.
