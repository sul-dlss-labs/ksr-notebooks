Johnson County Sheriff Dwayne Price tells WYMT one man is dead after a standoff with police in Johnson County.

"This is a first for me," Price said.

The incident began Monday evening when deputies were called to a home on Route 845 off of Highway 460, to check out someone in a front yard acting suspiciously. Officers say a man was walking around, holding a Bible, and looking up at the sky.

The man, who has been identified as Stephen Dalton of Oil Springs, started to argue and try to fight with a deputy. Deputies tased the Dalton, but he got away and ran into the house.

Deputies say they then heard several gunshots after Dalton ran into the house so they called Kentucky State Police for backup.

When KSP arrived, a shootout between Dalton and police began.

"When that door came open it just got so, so chaotic," Price said. "With all that gunfire. The trailer he was shooting from was kind of up a bank, probably 20 feet, so he was shooting down. If he was level, it could have been a different story for us."

A special response team was then called to the scene. They eventually sent a robot into the home after he didn't respond to officers.

That's when they discovered the Dalton was dead.

Investigators say it's too early to know if Dalton died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or if he was shot in the standoff.

Dalton's body has been sent off for a toxicology report.
