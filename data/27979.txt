Six officers shot and killed a suspect who approached them with a gun following a domestic assault Sunday night, according to Chief T.K. Waters of the Jacksonville Sheriff’s Office.

Police were called about 9:15 p.m. to a home in the 8000 block of East Voltaire Court off Fort Carolina Road where a boyfriend and girlfriend had gotten into an argument. Waters said the suspect battered the woman and fired a shot into a couch during the incident. The woman was able to get out and call 911.

Officers ordered him out using loud speakers, but the man refused. After continued efforts, Filipe Pereira came out and approached the officers. Waters said he reached into his right rear pocket where there was a firearm, and all six officers shot him. The gun was recovered in Pereira’s back pocket.

No children were in the home at the time, Waters said. He said Pereira was in his 40s, which court records indicate he was 45. He does not show up as having any criminal history with the Duval County clerk of court’s office.

Waters said it was the first police shooting for all six officers involved, each employed with the Sheriff’s Office from three to 11 years. They were Sgt. D.B. Gast and Officers A. Johnson, B.W. Griffis, A.B. Boyster, C.D. Plotter and K.E. McDonald.

This is the ninth suspect shot by Jacksonville police so far this year, five of them fatally, according to Times-Union records. Nine were shot all of last year, with six killed.
