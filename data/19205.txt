ORANGEBURG, SC (WIS) - An Orangeburg County sheriff's deputy has been hurt and another man was shot to death following a fight at a pool room early Monday morning.

Sheriff Larry Williams said the shooting happened about 2am Monday in Orangeburg.

Williams says deputies were confronted by a large number of people at a pool hall, and someone was beating a deputy with his own flashlight when the officer pulled his gun and fired.

Williams says the officer, identified as Deputy Kevin Smith, was treated and released from the hospital for injuries he suffered in the fight.

Coroner Samuetta Marshall says 35-year-old Johnathan Myron Stokes of Orangeburg died after being shot in the head.

Stokes leaves behind a wife, Tracey, and two children who say they are devastated at the thought of life without him.

"Yes, he was a father and I want to say he was the love of my life," said Tracey.

Tracey says she plans to sue. "I do want justice cause I felt it was wrong," she said.

Stokes' widow isn't the only one with questions. A memorial was set up near the crime scene where people gathered to put up signs that said "We Want Justice." Many of those present at the memorial were there the night Stokes died.

"It was one shot and they wouldn't tell us anything else," said Stokes' friend Fabian Simmons. "All we want is justice."

Tracey says Stokes was not the violent type and something just doesn't add up.

"I just don't know what I'm going to do next," said Tracey.

The sheriff says Smith is on leave while the State Law Enforcement Division investigates.
