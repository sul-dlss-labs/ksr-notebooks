An Escondido police officer was justified in using deadly force in the fatal shooting last year of an intoxicated man who pointed a shotgun at another officer, the District Attorney’s Office said.

The March 30 shooting of Randy Wayne Mullins, 25, of Escondido, by Officer Brandon Byler was in self-defense and in defense of the other officer, District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said in a letter to Escondido Police Chief Jim Maher.

The letter, which contained the results of an investigation by the District Attorney’s Office, was released Thursday by Escondido police.

Byler and Officer Jared Lunt responded about 3 a.m. to a domestic-disturbance call at the apartment of Mullins and his wife on West 10th Avenue. When they arrived, the officers heard a man yelling and a woman crying.

Mullins opened the door armed with the shotgun. When he leveled the shotgun and aimed it at Lunt, Byler grabbed the barrel with his left hand. While struggling over control of the shotgun, Byler drew his handgun and fired at Mullins.

An autopsy showed Mullins had 13 gunshot wounds to the torso. It also showed that he had a blood-alcohol level of .21 percent and marijuana in his system. He died at the scene.
