At 1:20 a.m. Boise Police responded to a request for a property check in the backyard of an address on N. 21st Street near W. Pleasanton Ave and W. State Street. The calling party reported someone trespassing and squatting for a couple of nights in an enclosed area on a property. Two officers, riding together in the same patrol vehicle, arrived at the location and walked down an alley looking for the person. As they approached the subject in a small, enclosed area, up against a building, they announced themselves as Boise Police officers. The suspect was laying on the ground and as officers asked him to show his hands, the suspect produced what appeared to be a handgun, pointing it toward officers. Officers gave quick commands to drop the gun and were forced to respond to what they believed was an immediate threat to their life. Officers began life-saving measures and requested Ada County Paramedics, unfortunately, the person was pronounced deceased at a local hospital. One officer was also treated for a superficial wound.

The Ada County Critical Incident Task Force (CITF) led by the Ada County Sheriffâ€™s Office has been activated to investigate the shooting. Officers on body video will be reviewed as part of the investigation. The information in this news release is considered preliminary pending the results of the CITF investigation.

As with all critical incidents, The Boise Police Department will also conduct an internal investigation. There will also be a separate investigation conducted by the City of Boise Office of Police Accountability.
