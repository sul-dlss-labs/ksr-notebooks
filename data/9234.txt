The blue Chrysler minivan came barreling down Lenox Avenue, leaving the police in its wake on Tuesday morning.

A gunpoint robbery had happened just minutes before, leading the police to stop the minivan and take the driver into custody. But then another suspect in the minivan grabbed the wheel and took off, going at least twice the speed limit for 20 blocks. The getaway lasted barely a minute.

The Chrysler minivan plowed into a Honda with a mother and son inside, then spun around and hit three pedestrians, including Sister Mary Celine Graham, 83, a nun who died of her injuries.

The frantic episode  which resulted on Wednesday in a murder charge against the man police say drove the minivan  prompted some onlookers to question police tactics regarding vehicle pursuits. Witnesses said they saw an unmarked police car about a block behind, its lights flashing and its siren blaring.
