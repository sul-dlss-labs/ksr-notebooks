A grand jury in Dakota County has found that a Hastings police sergeant was legally justified in using deadly force during a fatal confrontation with a 23-year-old Hastings man wielding a sword.

After responding to a 911 call about an assault, police Sgt. James Galland confronted and then opened fire on Brandon Lee Rodriguez in the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Cemetery on July 10. Rodriguez was taken to Regions Hospital in St. Paul, where he died in surgery.

According to a statement from the Dakota County Attorney’s office, a 19-year-old woman had ended her relationship with Rodriguez that night by returning his ring, and he responded by punching out the windows of her car and threatening to kill her and himself. The assault took place in the yard of a home bordering the cemetery.

Rodriguez allegedly displayed a sword and a crossbow during the assault, and his mother pleaded with him to stop the attack. A witness in the cemetery attempted to intervene, and Rodriguez allegedly chased him with the sword, jumping a chain link fence separating his yard from the cemetery.

The witness was able to get away unharmed.

Four Hastings officers and a police canine jumped the fence and found Rodriguez on a roadway in the cemetery. They repeatedly told him to drop his sword and get on the ground, but he approached them with the sword in a striking position, getting to within 15 or 20 feet of them, according to the statement from the county attorney’s office.

Believing that Rodriguez was about to strike a fellow officer, Galland fired four shots with his AR-15 police rifle. Three shots struck Rodriguez on the left side.

Rodriguez’s blood alcohol level was later determined to be 0.22.

In a statement, Dakota County Attorney James Backstrom said it is his policy to have a grand jury review all police officer shootings resulting in death.
