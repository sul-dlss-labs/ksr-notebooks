LAKELAND – Police fatally shot a central Florida man after a five-hour standoff in what authorities are calling a "suicide by cop."

Lakeland police say two patrol officers and two SWAT officers fatally shot 61-year-old James Arlen Monroe Jr. at his home late Monday night. Police also found Monroe's wife — 57-year-old Susan Monroe — dead in the home.

Police had responded earlier Monday after a relative called 9-1-1. Police could see through a window that James Monroe was armed. When officers made contact, Monroe reportedly made threats and said he wanted officers to shoot him.

Officials say the officers opened fire when Monroe pointed a handgun at them.

Officials say Susan Monroe contacted police last week because she was afraid her husband would harm himself. He was hospitalized and held for psychological evaluation under the Florida Baker Act.
