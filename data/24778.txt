Kauai police say a four-hour standoff Wednesday afternoon in Kekaha ended in an apparent murder-suicide.

A 53-year-old man died of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound and a 50-year-old woman died of a gunshot wound, police said.

Police responded to a call of a man who threatened to harm himself at about 2 p.m. on Elepaio Road.

Arriving officers tried to make contact with the man, but received no response after multiple attempts were made.

Kauai police sent a Special Services Team and Crisis Negotiators, who arrived at about 4 p.m.

Police entered at about 6:15 p.m. and found the pair dead.

An investigation is ongoing; an autopsy is pending, Kauai Police said in a news release.
