The man who was found dead this weekend after wounding a Broken Arrow police officer in a shootout likely shot and killed himself, investigators said.

Cory Gene Batt, 31, was found dead in a wooded area near the end of a foot pursuit that saw bullets fly between himself and Officer Caleb Sherman early Saturday.

Sherman, a Broken Arrow police officer for five years, reportedly attempted to stop a vehicle in the 2900 block of East Kenosha Street about 2:40 a.m. One of its occupants, believed to be Batt, fired at least one shot, striking Sherman in the leg, Broken Arrow Police Department spokesman Chris Walker said.

Two others reportedly ran from the vehicle before the shooting occurred.

Sherman has since been released from a hospital, Walker said.

Police searching the scene found Batt’s body, and investigators were waiting for a Medical Examiner’s confirmation of his manner of death. Investigators have not indicated whether Batt was shot during the exchange of gunfire.

Walker said Wednesday that the Medical Examiner’s investigation is ongoing but that investigators think Batts’ wound was self-inflicted.

Officers continue to search for the other occupants.

Anyone with information is asked to contact the Broken Arrow Police Department at 918-259-8400.
