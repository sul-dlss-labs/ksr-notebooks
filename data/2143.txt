LE MARS, Iowa -- An early-morning pursuit through Woodbury and Plymouth counties ended with a Moville, Iowa, man taking his own life.

The Iowa State Patrol reported that Jeremy W. Higginbotham, 20, of Moville, ended an hour-long police pursuit by taking his own life with a rifle.

At 2 a.m. Monday, an Iowa State Patrol officer attempted to stop a vehicle driven by Higginbotham for driving erratically on U.S. Highway 20 in Woodbury County.

Higginbotham attempted to elude officers for the next hour, traveling through Bronson, Iowa, and into Plymouth County at high speeds and without headlights.

Numerous times during the chase Higginbotham brandished a rifle at pursuing officers. Stop sticks were deployed in Le Mars, Iowa, puncturing at least one of the vehicle's tires.

While officers attempted to stop the vehicle, it struck a curb and came to rest in the street at Fourth Avenue and Second Street Southeast in Le Mars where officers found Higginbotham dead.

An investigation into the incident is continuing by the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation. The agency was unable to be reached for comment.

Agencies responding to the incident were the Iowa State Patrol, Woodbury County Sheriff's Department, Plymouth County Sheriff's Department, Plymouth County Medical Examiner, Le Mars Police Department, Le Mars Fire Department and Le Mars Ambulance Service.
