GRAND JUNCTION — No charges will be filed against a Colorado State Patrol trooper involved in a fatal shooting earlier this month, a district attorney said.

Twenty First Judicial District Attorney Dan Rubinstein announced Wednesday that Trooper Jason Wade will not face charges for killing 33-year-old Jayson Thompson, The Daily Sentinel reports.

Thompson ran toward Wade with a knife on a roadside near Grand Junction May 9, authorities said.

Rubinstein determined Wade acted in self-defense based on video and audio evidence and witness interviews.

Felony assault, attempted assault and menacing charges would have been filed against Thompson if he survived the shooting, Rubinstein said.

An investigation found Wade responded to a report of a person standing near Highway 50 for two hours.

Thompson pulled a knife from his waistband and ignored Wade’s orders to drop the weapon. Wade shot him when Thompson lunged at the trooper, a report said.

A jury would likely conclude there was a reasonable belief of imminent danger if a person ran at someone with a knife, Rubinstein said.

Rubinstein’s office, the Colorado Bureau of Investigations and three police and sheriff’s departments took part in the investigation.
