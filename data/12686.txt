MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. — The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it is investigating a fatal deputy-involved shooting in Brevard County.

Investigators said deputies shot and killed William Emanuel Poplos, 57, at a home on Merritt Island Monday, when he confronted them with a gun.

Residents along Belair Avenue in Merritt Island said they were shocked to hear gunshots inside their neighbors' home during a domestic dispute.

"We were surprised that this would escalate to that," said neighbor Lorna Ettman.

However, things became worse when deputies arrived after the woman inside, Poplos' 82-year-old fiancé, the home called 911.

The woman told investigators Poplos threatened her with a gun, before firing three rounds into the kitchen wall. The woman said she was able to get out of the home and call police.

As Poplos exited the home, officers said he threatened deputies with the firearm.

"Witnesses on the scene tell us that the suspect was pointing his gun, at which time deputies returned fire," said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

The man was rushed to Cape Canaveral hospital, where he later died.

"They were behind my car, using it as a shield, and evidently he came out and there were maybe for or five, maybe six gunshots," said Ettman.

Authorities said two deputies are on administrative leave as the Florida Department of Law Enforcement conducts an investigation into the death.
