A man was killed after an exchange with deputies Monday in Laguna Niguel, officials said.

The Orange County Sheriff’s Department responded to a call of a man and a woman involved in a dispute on the 40 block of Coral Sea Lane, where the Seaside at Laguna Heights apartment complex is located.

Deputies arrived and found a man in his 30s who was believed to be armed with a hammer, officials said.

The man was fatally shot during the confrontation, but it is unclear what led up to it.

No deputies nor the woman were injured during the shooting and it is unclear how many deputies were involved.
