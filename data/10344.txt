Investigation into Male's Death at 7900 Canyon

July 7, 2011 - Houston police are investigating the death of a burglary suspect following an incident at 7900 Canyon about 2 p.m. on Wednesday (July 6).



The male suspect, Craig Campbell (b/m, DOB: 11-29-68), was pronounced dead at Ben Taub General Hospital. Investigators are awaiting autopsy results from the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences on Campbell's cause of death.



HPD Homicide Division Sergeant T. Biggs and Officer M. Condon reported:



Mr. Campbell was observed stealing metal items in the area of the above location and drove the metal to a scrap metal business at 2820 Holmes Road. As Campbell was selling the metal at the business, he was confronted by one of the persons from whom he had stolen items.



After hearing police were called and on their way to the business, Campbell fled on foot and ran east on Holmes. He was detained about four blocks away (7900 Canyon) by an employee of the scrap metal business who waited for police to arrive. Officers arrived and took Campbell into custody without incident. Officers noticed Campbell was not sweating and was breathing very hard. They called for paramedics to check on him. HFD paramedics arrived and began checking on Campbell's condition. At that time, he became unresponsive and was transported to the hospital where he was pronounced dead about two hours later.



As is customary in in-custody death incidents in the city limits, the case is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions.
