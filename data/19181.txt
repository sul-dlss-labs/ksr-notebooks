According to investigators, a Laurel County sheriff's deputy shot and killed a man during an exchange of gunfire Friday night.

The Laurel County Sheriff's office says they arrived at the scene at 9:40 p.m. Friday at a home on the 800 block of Sibert Road, which is just off Ky. 80 east of London.

Deputies say when they arrived, shots were fired from inside the home, hitting a deputy's cruiser numerous times.

Officials say the deputies returned fire in self-defense.

The sheriff's office says the Kentucky State Police special response team sent a robot into the house, and found the suspect dead just after 4 a.m. Saturday.

The Laurel County coroner has identified the victim as 30-year-old Joey Isgrigg.

One of Isgrigg's relatives spoke to WKYT. She said she doesn't know why the shooting happened and she did not condone her brother's actions.

That relative said an aunt, who helped raise Isgrigg, died recently and he was having a hard time coping.

Another relative told WKYT they thought drugs were to blame for the shootout with deputies.

"He was just an every day kid," Isgrigg's relative said. "He grew up here and it was so full of life. I think he just got in with the wrong people."

Police say two other people were found inside the home. 26-year-old Bertha Isgrigg was arrested and charged with public intoxication of a controlled substance. She denied WKYT's request for an interview from the Laurel County Detention Center.

Truman Weaver was taken to the hospital complaining of hip pain.

Laurel County Sheriff John Root said he asked Kentucky State Police to take over the investigation because it involved one of his deputies.

Laurel County Coroner Doug Bowling said Isgrigg's body will be sent to Frankfort for an autopsy.
