A man involved in a shootout with police at a Hollywood Hills home died from multiple gunshot wounds and did not commit suicide, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office confirmed Thursday.



The shootout occurred as Los Angeles Police Department officers responded to a report Monday morning of domestic violence at the home in the 8200 block of Gould Avenue, just off winding Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Authorities said a man who lived at the home -- identified as 27-year-old Michael Valentino -- opened fire on responding officers.

Officers returned fire, but SWAT members were unable to enter the residence until hours later, when the shooter was found dead. SWAT members did not fire any rounds, according to the LAPD.

Court records showed that Valentino had a history of criminal convictions, including for forgery, battery and burglary under an alias.

An officer injured in the shooting was treated at a hospital. The injuries may have been the result of being hit by bullet fragments or debris, police said.
