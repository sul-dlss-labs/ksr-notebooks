Police are withholding the name of the officer, and the suspected drug dealer has not been positively identified.

Brookfield Police Chief Thomas Schoenfeld said that the injured officer fired his weapon, but Schoenfeld said he doesn't know whether the suspect was armed or what prompted police to fire at him.

The incident began in a strip mall at 47th Street and Plainfield Road in Brookfield as part of an undercover drug operation, Schoenfeld said. The officer had entered the suspect's car to buy drugs. The officer identified himself and told the suspect he was under arrest. The suspect tried to drive away, Schoenfeld said.

The two men struggled for control of the car for two blocks, he said.

Lt. Lincoln Hampton, a spokesman for the Illinois State Police, said Friday that the case is being investigated by the department's public integrity unit, but he declined to offer any details of the incident.
