HAMMOND, LA (WVUE) - Tangipahoa Parish sheriff's deputies shot and killed a man whom they say stabbed his mother Tuesday.

The deceased was identified as 48-year-old Michael Nichols.

The incident began at about 2 p.m. as a domestic disturbance call on Deborah Drive near Hammond. Responding deputies arrived to find Nichols attacking a woman with a knife. At least one deputy opened fire in an effort to save her.

"Tangipahoa Sheriff's Office requested State Police to process the scene," said State Police spokesman Trooper Greg Marchand. He said this is standard procedure in officer-involved shootings.

Investigators couldn't say how many deputies fired shots, but they plan to gather the evidence and turn it over the district attorney.

Marchand said the suspect's mother was hospitalized, but her condition is not known. While an investigation into the use of force is underway, Marchand said it appears the deputies did what they were trained to do.

"Obviously, if your life or somebody else's life is in imminent danger, which this victim's was, we have to react and we have to stop the threat," Marchand said. "And today, that's what these deputies did."

Investigators have not yet released the names of the deputies involved. They also did not have information on whether there had been prior incidents at the home.
