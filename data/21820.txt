Update (11:50 a.m.) An armed, reportedly suicidal man was shot and killed by Baltimore County police Sunday night in Dundalk. He has been identified as Nathaniel Dixson McCormick, 40, of the 7300 block of Berkshire Road.

Baltimore County police responded at approximately 9:20 p.m. to a home in the 7300 block of Berkshire Road following a 911 call about a suicidal man, according to Lt. Rob McCullough, a police spokesman. A family member made the 911 call, McCullough said. "The subject was threatening to hurt anyone who came near him," McCullough said.

According to a Baltimore County police statement, when patrol officers approached the glass front door storm door of the house, they observed McCormick standing near the door inside the home and holding a knife. Officers ordered McCormick to drop the knife, but he refused to do so, according to police, who said McCormick "then charged toward the front door and officers standing on the front porch on the other side of the glass."

Fearing for his safety, according to police, one officer fired several rounds from his duty weapon at McCormick. Initial reports from police Sunday night indicated that McCormick possessed two large knives. McCormick was taken to Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center where he was pronounced dead shortly after his arrival.

Berkshire Road remained closed past midnight as police continued their investigation. "The case will be reviewed internally and by the Baltimore County State’s Attorney’s Office. The officer has been placed on routine administrative leave," Baltimore Count police wrote in a statement.
