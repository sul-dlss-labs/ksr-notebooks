A parent’s request for help in dealing with an agitated son led to the son’s shooting death by a sheriff’s deputy, sheriff’s officials said.

Deputies were summoned at 6:25 a.m. Monday, Aug. 13, to the 34000 block of Avenue G in Yucaipa, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.

One of the man’s parents told deputies the son returned home exhibiting symptoms of paranoia and believing that he was being followed, the department said. The parent also said that the son might have ingested drugs and wouldn’t settle down.

When deputies arrived, the son, identified as Theodore Wann, 23, had fled on foot and was running through yards in the neighborhood, the department said.

A deputy caught up with Wann, who immediately engaged the deputy in a physical altercation, the department said. Wann attacked the deputy with a shovel; the deputy, fearing for his life, shot Wann, who was pronounced dead at the scene.

The deputy was treated at the scene for minor cuts and bruises suffered during the struggle, Clifford said.

Members of the sheriff’s homicide detail showed up to investigate the shooting, which is normal procedure when an officer is involved.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call Detective Steve Pennington or Sgt. Rick Bessinger at 909-387-3589 or sheriff’s dispatch at 909-356-3973. Anonymous tips can be left with the We Tip hotline at 1-800-78-CRIME or on the We Tip website at www.wetip.com.
