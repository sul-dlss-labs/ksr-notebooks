ST. LANDRY PARISH, La. – The suspect who held his girlfriend at gunpoint for several hours near Port Barre is now dead, according to Sheriff Bobby Guidroz.

Timothy R. Albert, 40, died upon arrival at Opelousas General Hospital Wednesday afternoon.

The girlfriend was unharmed and is currently with deputies, according to officials.

Guidroz explained the SWAT Team decided to end the standoff when they heard Albert say, “I’m tired of this, I’m going to shoot her.”

That’s when deputies entered the room, fired tear gas and saw the suspect level his weapon towards them.

Shots were then fired and the suspect was hit, according to Guidroz.

Albert was initially believed to be deceased, but with the help of medics the suspect was transported to the hospital in critical condition.

Guidroz told News 10 he knew Albert personally and that Albert had a criminal history.

As of Wednesday, there two outstanding arrest warrants for Albert on charges of domestic violence.

It all began around 11 a.m. when the sheriff’s office received a call from a neighbor saying that the suspect, armed with a rifle, was chasing a woman into a ditch.

He then allegedly dragged the girlfriend by her arm back to his home, located in the 2800 block of Highway 741.

That’s when investigators believe Albert barricaded himself and his girlfriend in a back room of the home.

A neighbor also reported hearing a single gunshot before deputies arrived on the scene.

The sheriff said a 3-year-old child was inside the home with the couple and got out of the building.

The child is now safe and in the custody of the sheriff’s office. Deputies are still investigating the incident.

KLFY’s Jazmin Thibodeaux will have a live report from the scene at 5 and 6 p.m.
