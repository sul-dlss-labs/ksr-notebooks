Efrain Herrera Jr., a 24-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Sunday, Jan. 17 in the 8800 block of Norwich Avenue in North Hills, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

About 5:10 p.m. officers with the LAPD’s Mission and West Valley divisions responded to the area after someone reported a man with a knife, police said.

When officers arrived, Chief Charlie Beck told The Times, Herrera confronted the officers and approached them with a hunting knife. The officers tried to subdue the man with a Taser, the chief said, but it "wasn't completely effective."

Herrera continued to approach the officers, who then opened fire, Beck said.

Officers from the West Valley Division -- who don't yet have LAPD-issued body cameras -- were involved in the shooting, a police spokeswoman said.

Investigators will check to see if cameras worn by the Mission Division officers who were also at the scene captured the deadly encounter.

Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call LAPD’s Force Investigation Division at (213) 486-5230. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
