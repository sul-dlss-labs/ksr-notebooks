ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) – A police chase through south St. Louis Thursday morning ends with three people dead on the Grand Boulevard bridge.

Investigators were on the scene of this fatal crash all morning. It started around 2:30am Thursday when police received about half a dozen radio calls for shots fired on Minnesota Avenue, including shots fired inside a home on that street.

Officers were on the lookout for a dark-colored Nissan Maxima involved in the incident.

When officers located the vehicle, they noticed four people in the car and a backseat passenger holding what appeared to be a rifle.

The car sped by police, heading west on Shenandoah and north on Grand. When the car crossed Chouteau, the driver lost control, went sideways and struck a series of decorative concrete planters and a light pole.

Police say 22-year-old Lamont Cross, 23-year-old Gregory Franklin, and 20-year-old Dasha Rhodes were pronounced dead at the scene. A 21-year-old male remains hospitalized in critical but stable condition.

St. Louis police Capt. Michael Sack explains, “It’s quite a vehicle accident, it’s very horrific. The vehicle that struck the planter boxes is at one location, the entire front of the vehicle is torn, and is probably 50-60 yards further north up Grand Avenue. There’s pieces of the vehicle debris spread through a very large area.”

Police say the whole chase lasted maybe five minutes. They add, this is one of the worst wrecks they’ve seen in this area. Because the crash was so severe, lanes on the bridge were closed for a long time during accident reconstruction.
