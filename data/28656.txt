REDMOND, Wash. — A domestic dispute involving an armed man resulted in a standoff and death Sunday night in Redmond, police said.

Law enforcement said they received a 911 call at about 8 p.m. regarding a domestic disturbance at a home in the 9900 block of 183rd Court Northeast.

Investigators said a father fired one gunshot inside the home. Family members, including children, were able to get out of the home safely.

Police said they used reverse 911 to notify more than 100 homes within a quarter-mile to shelter in place.

At about 11 p.m., KIRO 7 found out that the armed man was still inside the home. It wasn’t clear what led to the incident, but police were working to get the man out safely.

“We just want everybody to be safe tonight. We know it is pretty traumatic what happened tonight. And the neighbors are probably pretty scared and we respect that. We just want everyone to be safe tonight, and so we’re going take as much time and go as slow as we need to make sure everyone goes home tonight,” said Sgt. Julie Beard, of the Redmond Police Department.

Law enforcement officials told KIRO 7 that there was no significant history of 911 calls from the home.

About 2:09 a.m., Redmond police tweeted that the man was found dead inside the home.
