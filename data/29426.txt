JEFFERSON CITY â€” A 59-year-old man armed with a knife was shot and killed by Jefferson City police after ignoring orders to drop the weapon, the Missouri Highway Patrol said Monday.

Authorities initially said the man was from the St. Louis area, but identified him Monday as James Reising, 59, of Columbia, Missouri.

Police responded to a call about a man with a large knife midday Sunday at 3535 Missouri Boulevard, just off Highway 50, where several stores and restaurants are located.

When officers encountered Reising, he "presented a knife in a threatening manner," according to the patrol. At least two officers fired at him.

Reising died at a hospital. No officers were injured.

The incident remains under investigation by the highway patrol.
