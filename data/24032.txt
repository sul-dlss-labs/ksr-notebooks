Jacksonville police responded Thursday afternoon to a standoff that occurred in a Mandarin home.

The man inside the home is a U.S. Navy doctor, multiple sources told Action News Jax. Multiple snipers could be seen on nearby rooftops.

The home is located in the 4100 block of Weatherwood E. Drive in the Clearwater Creek subdivision.

Shots could be heard as investigators worked to make contact with the person inside. Police were on the phone with someone when shots could be heard.

The area around the home was blocked off, which prevented neighbors from returning home.

The situation began around 2:30 p.m., authorities said.

JSO is expected to update the situation later Thursday evening.
