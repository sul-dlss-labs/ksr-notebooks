CHESTER - Authorities are still trying to piece together information about a Saturday morning shooting incident that left a 57-year-old Chester man dead and his wife in a St. Louis hospital with a gunshot wound.

According to Chester police, Arthur W. "Archie" Brunkhorst died at about 2:30 a.m. from a self-inflicted gunshot wound - only minutes after shooting his wife Charlotte and then fleeing the couple's home located at 204 Harmsen Circle.

Police were called to the residence and discovered Charlotte Brunkhorst, who had been shot.

Police would not say where Mrs. Brunkhorst was shot but did confirm that her injuries were not life-threatening. She was taken to Chester Memorial Hospital and then later transferred to a St. Louis hospital where she was in satisfactory condition.

While medical technicians attended to Mrs. Brunkhorst, law enforcement officers converged on and circled a wooded area near the residence.

At about 2:30 a.m., officers reported hearing a muffled gunshot coming from the wooded area but because of the darkness waited until about 5:35 to begin searching the woods, with 10 officers walking through the woods and additional officers keeping a perimeter area circled.

Brunkhorst's body was discovered at 5:49 a.m.

Authorities would not release any information on what might have prompted the shooting and suicide. State police, the Randolph County Sheriff's Department and police from Chester and Steeleville responded to the shooting incident.
