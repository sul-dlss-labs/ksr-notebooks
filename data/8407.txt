Avery Cody Jr., a 16-year-old black youth, was shot by a sheriff's deputy and died July 5 at Alondra Boulevard and Poinsettia Avenue in Compton, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's office.

The only information released by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department about the incident was that a loaded handgun was recovered from the scene of the shooting.

"The involved personnel were on routine patrol at the time," said Sgt. David Insante, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Department.

Coroner's investigators said Cody was taken to the hospital and pronounced dead at 4:05 p.m.

Insante said he did not know when or if his office would release details about what happened leading up to the shooting.
