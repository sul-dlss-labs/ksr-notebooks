Phoenix Police have identified Adam O'Neal Reinhart, 29, as the man fatally shot by officers after he reportedly pulled a weapon on them Saturday, according to a department statement.

Police confronted Reinhart, who ignored police commands before he pulled a handgun from his waistband, prompting an officer to fire a single round from a service rifle into Reinhart, according to Sgt. Vince Lewis, a Phoenix Police spokesman.

The officer's name had not been released as of Monday afternoon.

Police had gone to the area of 18th Street and Palm Lane on Saturday afternoon after receiving multiple 911 calls of a man acting strangely and in danger of being struck by traffic, according to a police department statement.

Witness statements varied, with some stating that Reinhart produced a weapon and others saying that he had not. Neighbors told reporters that Reinhart was often seen in the area and they believed him to be homeless.

After being shot, Reinhart was transported to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Lewis said.

The officer who fired the fatal round is a 10-year veteran of the force and is on paid, administrative leave while the investigation is underway, per Phoenix Police policy, Lewis said.
