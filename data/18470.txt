The man threatened deputies with a knife, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. No deputies were injured.

LEALMAN – The Pinellas Sheriff’s Office is investigating a deputy-involved shooting that left a Lealman man dead.

Deputies answered a call to 4280 Mallory Drive, No. 101, at Duval Park in the unincorporated Lealman area about 5:28 p.m. Wednesday (Nov. 23). A neighbor in the next door unit had reported a domestic altercation involving 36-year-old Megan Anderson and 43-year-old William J. Beavers.

Deputies Brennen Wede and Tyler Green went to the caller’s residence where Anderson and two children, ages 10 and 12, had taken refuge. Anderson told deputies that Mr. Beavers had been violent, was intoxicated and would be uncooperative.

After deputies knocked on Mr. Beavers’ door several times, he answered the door and came out with a knife held over his shoulder towards Wede. As Wede retreated, Green several times told Mr. Beavers to drop the knife; however, Mr. Beavers refused. Green fired multiple shots striking Mr. Beavers in the upper body. He died at the scene. Neither deputy was injured.

Green will be placed on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
