An off-duty New York City police officer shot and killed a 20-year-old man outside a popular bar and restaurant in Yonkers early yesterday after the man stabbed another off-duty officer, the police said.

The deadly fight broke out at 3:15 a.m. after a disturbance that began inside the bar, Rory Dolan's, moved out onto the sidewalk on McLean Avenue, a busy strip dominated by Irish pubs and businesses in southern Westchester County.

According to the Yonkers police, the two officers, who are assigned to the Bronx Anti-Crime Unit in the 47th Precinct, got off work at 2 a.m. and stopped by the bar afterward. Shortly after they arrived, there was a dispute involving patrons. When the two officers intervened, a patron stabbed one of them, Officer John Baumeister, 30, several times in the body.

The police said Michael Ingram, 41, a police sergeant, fired two shots at the assailant, Peter Lee, a Yonkers man with a criminal history, including convictions for attempted robbery and assault. Mr. Lee, who was pronounced dead at the scene, had been drinking at the bar despite his being under age, the police said.
