Choctaw County District Attorney Mark Matloff confirms Delton Ray Flowers, Jr. is the man who died after an altercation led to the officer-involved shooting.

Matloff says according to reports, security was called after an incident in the casino portion of the travel plaza.

Matloff says surveillance video shows Flowers reach for what looked like a revolver in his pocket and after several requests from the officers to put the weapon down, they fired, killing Flowers.

It was later discovered the 'revolver' was actually a pellet gun.

So far, no charges have been filed in the shooting.
