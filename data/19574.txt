SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) â€” Police in southwestern Missouri's Springfield say a man who kept authorities in a several-hour standoff was later found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound inside the house.

Police say officers responding to a reported domestic disturbance Tuesday afternoon outside a house saw a man later identified as 52-year-old Phillip Luker run inside the residence, retrieve a gun and point it at an officer, starting a standoff.

Police say that after several hours of negotiations, tactical officers entered the home and found Luker's body.

Police say the investigation continues.
