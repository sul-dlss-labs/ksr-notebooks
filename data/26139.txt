The shooter opened fire in Building 2 of the municipal center, which is adjacent to City Hall.

The Municipal Center is a sprawling complex in the southern portion of Virginia‚Äôs largest city, and houses everything from courthouses to the city‚Äôs sheriff‚Äôs office and police department.

The building houses the city‚Äôs public works, public utilities and planning departments, according to City Councilwoman Barbara Henley, who arrived at City Hall building about 4 p.m. Friday just after the shooting.

The shooting sent shock waves through Virginia Beach, the state‚Äôs largest city and a popular vacation spot in southeastern Virginia. The building where the attack took place is in a suburban complex miles away from the high-rise hotels along the beach and the downtown business area.

‚ÄúThat they should be taken in this manner is the worst kind of tragedy,‚Äù the governor said during the news conference on Friday night. Gov. Northam released a full statement after making the trip to Virginia Beach:

This is a horrific day for the Commonwealth of Virginia. We are devastated by the tragic shooting in Virginia Beach. I am in Virginia Beach with law enforcement authorities and Mayor Dyer, where I am monitoring the situation and offer the state‚Äôs full support. My deepest condolences and prayers go to the families of those who left home this morning, and will not return tonight, as well as those who have been injured in this tragedy. This is unspeakable, senseless violence. I commend local and state law enforcement, first responders, medical teams, and all others who acted swiftly to respond to this situation. My thoughts continue to be with the victims and their families.‚Äù -Gov. Ralph Northam

Megan Banton, an administrative assistant who works in the building where the shooting happened, said she heard gunshots, called 911 and barricaded a door.

‚ÄúWe tried to do everything we could to keep everybody safe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe were all just terrified. It felt like it wasn‚Äôt real, like we were in a dream. You are just terrified because all you can hear is the gunshots.‚Äù

She said she texted her mom, telling her that there was an active shooter in the building, and she and others were waiting for police. Banton works in an office of about 20 people that is part of the public works department.

‚ÄúThank God my baby is OK,‚Äù Banton‚Äôs mother, Dana Showers, said.

Forensic investigators from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and Virginia State Police were being sent to the scene to help local police investigate the attack.

Virginia Beach native Pharrell Williams tweeted, ‚ÄúWe are praying for our city, the lives that were lost, their families and everyone affected. We are resilient.We will not only get through this but we‚Äôll come out of this stronger than before we always do.‚Äù
