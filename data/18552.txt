Agents with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement are taking over an investigation into the circumstances leading to the in-custody death of a man overnight Monday.

The unidentified man died at Palm Bay Hospital shortly after Palm Bay police were called 2:50 a.m. to a home in the 200 block of Abello Road to investigate reports of a disturbance.

So far, few details of the incident have emerged, including whether force was used – if at all - by the officers involved. The status of the officers was not immediately available.

“It’s still an active investigation. But FDLE is taking over the investigation,” said Lt. Mike Bandish, spokesman for the Palm Bay Police Department.

Police said a family member called to report that the man was in the house and ‘out of control,’ reports show.

Officers physically restrained the man who was then taken to Palm Bay Hospital’s emergency where doctors later pronounced him dead.

An investigation is ongoing.
