John Anthony Gonzalez, an 18-year-old Latino, was killed by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies Dec. 1 in the 12600 block of Pioneer Boulevard in Norwalk, according to Los Angeles County coroner records.

The incident began about 6:30 p.m. when members of the sheriff's gang unit stopped two men walking north on Pioneer Boulevard near Imperial Highway, Lt. Victor Lewandowski said.

"Their gait was such that they [the deputies] could tell they were carrying something in their waistbands," Lewandowski said.

When the detectives got closer, Lewandowski said, they could see one of the men trying to drop a handgun. The deputies tried to stop them, but one man, later identified as Gonzalez, allegedly pointed his gun at the deputies, and the deputies opened fire.

Gonzalez was struck and pronounced dead at the scene at 6:46 p.m., according to coroner's records.

His companion, Jobani Meza, an 18-year-old Latino, got on the ground, Lewandowski said, and was not injured. Meza was arrested on suspicion of gun possession and a probation violation, Lewandowski said. He is being held without bail.

Gonzalez lived in Whittier, according to coroner's records. Lewandowski said both men are gang members.

Investigators said they recovered two loaded guns â€” a revolver and a 9mm pistol.

Two detectives were involved in the shooting, Lewandowski said, but he said he would not identify them.
