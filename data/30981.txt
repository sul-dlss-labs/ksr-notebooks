ESCONDIDO, Calif. (KGTV) -- Escondido police shot and killed a suspect Friday who they said was involved in an earlier vehicle-to-vehicle shooting.

According to police, the suspect shot into another vehicle at 5:01 p.m. and struck the 20-year-old male driver, who had a 15-year-old passenger in the vehicle, said Escondido Police Department Lt. Bode Berreth.

The victim was taken to a hospital with unknown injuries.

Officers responded to a call of shots fired, located the suspect's vehicle -- a white Mercedes-Benz SUV -- at 6:12 p.m. near Washington and Citrus avenues and a vehicle pursuit began, Berreth said.

The suspect crashed the SUV in the area of Bear Valley Parkway and Encino Drive around 6:20 p.m. After the crash, gunfire was exchanged with the suspect, who was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead, Berreth said.
