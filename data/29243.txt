Authorities worked Wednesday to reunite a kidnapped Ohio woman with her family after a central Louisiana shootout that killed her abductor and wounded a New Orleans-based FBI agent.

They identified the dead man as James David Hawley, 47, of Cleveland, accused of killing Norma Matko, 69, in Belmont County, Ohio, and kidnapping her daughter, Thoue Nichole Bronowski, 45, who is his ex-girlfriend.

The wounded agent was being treated at a hospital, said Alicia Irmscher, spokeswoman for the FBI office in New Orleans. The agent, whose name wasn't released, remained hospitalized as of early Wednesday evening.

Matko was found fatally shot, "sexually assaulted and mutilated" in her home in on Thanksgiving, according to documents that the FBI filed in federal court in Cleveland. The next day, Bronowski was reported missing to police in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio, about 115 miles away.
