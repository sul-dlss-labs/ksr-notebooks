A Chicago teenager who police say crashed a stolen car Wednesday while trying to elude officers has died of injuries suffered in the crash.

Joel Pena, 18, of the 1500 block of North Kedvale Avenue, died of multiple injuries at 9:26 a.m. Friday in Illinois Masonic Hospital, according to a spokesman for the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Pena and two passengers were stopped by Chicago police about 11:15 p.m. Wednesday on suspicion of driving a stolen car, near West Diversey Avenue and North Pulaski Road, a police spokesman said.

After the car was stopped, Pena drove off and slightly injured an officer standing next to the car, police said. Shortly later, Pena wrecked the car about 1 1/2 miles away, in the 3200 block of North Cicero Avenue, by crashing into a passing vehicle. No one in that vehicle or anyone else in Pena's car was injured, the spokesman said.
