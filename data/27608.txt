An officer-involved shooting involving Brea police officers left a suspect dead at Carbon Canyon Regional Park on Tuesday, Feb. 25.

No officers were injured, the Orange County Sheriff’s Department tweeted, adding “The suspect is deceased.”

The incident was under investigation by the Sheriff’s Department, said Carrie Braun, a spokeswoman for the agency.

The incident unfolded when Brea officers were responding to a call at the park of a man with a gun, the Sheriff’s Department said on social media.

Further details were not immediately available. Authorities were unable to confirm Wednesday if a firearm had been recovered from the suspect.

Officials had closed Carbon Canyon Road while Brea police searched the area on Thursday, Feb. 20, following reports of a man who may have discharged a firearm nearby. It was not immediately known if Tuesday’s shooting was related to that incident.
