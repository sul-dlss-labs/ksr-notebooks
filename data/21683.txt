A city police officer wounded on Tuesday while trying to make an arrest was struck by a stray bullet from a colleague's gun as officers fired on a suspect, the police said yesterday. Detective Orlando Velazquez, 40, was shot in the hand when a bullet ricocheted off an unknown object. He was among several officers pursuing a man who the authorities said stole a woman's purse, tried to cash one of her checks and then wrested a gun from an officer in a struggle near Nursery Street and Broadway. The police fatally shot the suspect -- identified yesterday as Al Rahman Hall, 27, of New York City -- when he refused to drop the weapon. He had been arrested nine times since 2004 and was convicted of three felonies, the police said. Damien Cave (NYT)
