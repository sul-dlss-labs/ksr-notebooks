HELENA-WEST HELENA â€” Police in eastern Arkansas say an officer shot and killed a man who authorities saw stabbing a woman.

Helena-West Helena Police Chief James Smith told WMC-TV that officers went to a home about 1 a.m. Thursday in search of a man wanted by police.

Smith said when officers arrived they saw a 39-year-old man stabbing a 20-year-old woman. Smith said the officers ordered the man to drop the knife, but he approached an officer, who then fatally shot him.

The police chief did not immediately return a phone call to The Associated Press.

Smith said the woman also later died. No names were immediately released.

The officer is on paid leave pending an investigation into the shooting.
