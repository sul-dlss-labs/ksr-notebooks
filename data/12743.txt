The bomb squad was called to Miami Dade College's North campus after an armed man was fatally shot by police Saturday afternoon, officials said.



Miami-Dade Police were called to the campus after reports of a man brandishing a gun on a bus, said Detective Alvaro Zabaleta.



When the man got off the bus at Northwest 114th Street and 27th Avenue, he was met by police and shots were fired, Zabaleta said. Officials approached the man to render aid, but backed away when he appeared to have a grenade in his hand, according to Zabaleta.



Police had received several calls from passengers on the bus that was traveling north on 27th Avenue, according to investigators. The bus stopped just east of the campus and the armed man walked onto the campus property, police said. It is unclear whether or not the man shot at police.



The incident did not affect the school which was closed, said MDC Director of Communications Juan Mendieta.
