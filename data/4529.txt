POLICE HAVE identified a man who was fatally shot by a cop after refusing to drop a knife in a Queens subway station over the weekend. Juventino Mendez, 43, of Jamaica, Queens, was killed Saturday when a transit cop confronted him in the 74th St.-Broadway station in Jackson Heights. The cop fired one bullet into Mendez's chest after Mendez ignored repeated orders to drop the 8-inch steak knife he had used in a fight earlier, cops said. He was taken to Elmhurst Hospital Center, where he died.
