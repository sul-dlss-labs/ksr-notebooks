MIAMI – A police-involved shooting that took place on New Year’s Eve has become fatal.

Authorities are still investigating, saying reports of gunfire is what set the whole situation off, eventually forcing officers to open fire.

It happened in Miami near Southwest 38th Avenue and 28th Street.

Family members told Local 10 the person killed in the shooting is Rodolfo Caraballo Moreno.

According to his brother and son, Caraballo Moreno was killed after police shot him several times with a rifle.

Neighbor Alicio Ruiz told Local 10 News’ Hatzel Vela that he first heard five gunshots. Soon after, police arrived, and then more shots were fired.

Miami Police Chief Jorge Colina said there was an initial call of shots fired.

“One of our officers makes contact with a subject, that officer does engage that subject and fired his weapon,” Colina said. “The subject was struck.”

Relatives said there may have been some confusion. They said Caraballo Moreno did have two guns and may have thought he was defending himself.

His work van remains in the parking lot. State records show Caraballo Moreno owned his air conditioning and appliance service business since 2009.
