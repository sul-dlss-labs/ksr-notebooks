North Las Vegas Police: Officer shoots man during fight

A North Las Vegas Police officer shot and killed a domestic violence suspect this morning during a fight at a home near Fifth Street and Interstate 15, authorities said.

Just before he opened fire, striking the suspect in the chest, the officer had broken free from a chokehold the man had put on him, police said.

Two officers responded about 6 a.m. to the 700 block of East Nelson Avenue, where a woman told them her boyfriend had beaten her, police said.

The woman said she was going to leave the home but needed to get her phone and shoes, which the officers initially advised her against, police said. But they followed her into a bedroom, police said.

“The officers asked the suspect to come out of the room, as they had probable cause to arrest him,” police said in a news release.

The suspect began fighting one of the officers, and the other one joined in, police said. At one point, the suspect grabbed an officer from behind and put him in a chokehold, police said.

The officer broke free and shot the man, police said.
