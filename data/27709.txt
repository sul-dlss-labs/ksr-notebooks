A man is dead and the OSBI is investigating after a deputy-involved shooting outside of Claremore as that deputy was trying to serve that man with a protective order.

The Rogers County sheriff said the deputy was serving a protective order that had been filed by the mother of his children, who said on March 9 after an ultrasound appointment, he beat and choked her, and the next day he threatened to beat her with a gun.

The sheriff’s office said the suspect is Jorge Martinez and records show he’s been to prison for aggravated assault and was released in 2017.

Sheriff Scott Walton said when the deputy tried to serve Martinez the protective order, he got angry and began to fight the deputy. The sheriff said the deputy’s radio got knocked away, he has injuries and his uniform was ripped.

They said the deputy fired one shot and killed Martinez.

Walton said two women and children were inside the home and told them Martinez was saying he didn't want to go back to prison or give up his kids to their mother.

“We have a deputy all by his lonesome in a situation that could have been a very simple process of receiving papers,” said Walton. “Instead, we've got a man dead and a deputy with that on his mind."

On the protective order the woman said she had been in an abusive relationship with Martinez for four years and she and the children had often taken refuge at the Claremore Safe Net Services, but then she would go back to him.
