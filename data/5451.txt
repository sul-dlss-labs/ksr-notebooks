Man Under the Influence Dies After Arrest in Boyle Heights September 6, 2006

Los Angeles: An intoxicated man causing a disturbance died after his arrest early Monday in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles.

On September 4, 2006, shortly before 1:00 a.m., officers from Hollenbeck Area Station were sent to a residence in the 3300 block of Whittier Boulevard after receiving reports of a disturbance. When police arrived, they found a man, later identified as Jesus Mejia, 31, in an agitated, combative state. Judging from the suspect’s excessive perspiration, glazed eyes and apparently heightened physical strength, officers deduced that Mejia was under the influence of narcotics. Mejia refused to comply with officers’ instructions.

Police Officer Victor Arellano, 43, was one of several officers who responded to the back-up call. He administered the Taser as fellow officers subdued Mejia with their body weight.

Once in the police car, Mejia developed difficulty breathing. Paramedics from the Los Angeles City Fire Department rushed him to Los Angeles County USC Medical Center, where he failed to respond to treatment and died.

Officer Arellano has been with the Department for ten years.

Force Investigation Division is handling the inquiry. Questions on this matter may be directed to Media Relations Section.
