On Tuesday, New Castle County police determined Edwards was inside of a home in Coatesville, Pennsylvania. Coatesville Police and Chester County SWAT forces arrived and set up a perimeter outside of the home.

Police say they unsuccessfully attempted to call Edwards out of the home. When they entered the home, Edwards was found dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

"This was certainly an unfortunate incident for all involved," said New Castle Count Colonel Vaughn Bond. "We would like to thank the multiple agencies and members of the community for their assistance. Also, we ask that you keep our officers and the Edwards family in prayer."
