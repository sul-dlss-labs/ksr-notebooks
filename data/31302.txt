ST. LOUIS, Mo. – A 39-year-old man is dead after a shootout with police in St. Louis Friday.

Police were called to the 275 on the Park apartment complex after residents reported hearing gunshots around 10 a.m. The St. Louis Fire Department helped officers to enter the apartment.

Once inside they encountered a man with a gun. When he refused to drop his weapon there was a shootout with officers.

Officers retreated from the scene and asked for backup. The police report’s next statement is that the 39-year-old man died. It is not clear what led to the man’s demise but no officers were injured in the incident.

St. Louis Police Chief John Hayden said an AR-15 and pistol belonging to the man were found in the apartment.

Apartment residents said they received an email around 10:45 a.m., alerting them to stay indoors.

“We weren’t given any information about it and were told it was a developing situation and St. Louis police were on the scene,” said resident Brendan McGuire. “I mean I live approximately three blocks from the Delmar divide, hearing that kind of information isn’t out of the normal but definitely didn’t anticipate being right in the building.”

The officer-involved shooting is still under investigation.
