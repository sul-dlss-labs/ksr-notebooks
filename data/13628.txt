FULLERTON – A man died Wednesday morning after crashing a car into a tree, a parked car and a home while fleeing police, officials said.

Officers first attempted to stop the man, who was driving a silver Scion, around 2 a.m. near Harbor Boulevard and West Wilshire Avenue, Fullerton police Sgt. Jeff Stuart said. A taxi driver had reported dropping off the man at the intersection and told police the man had assaulted him, Stuart said.

The man, who the taxi driver told police had been drinking, then got into the Scion, Stuart said. Officers followed the speeding driver to a T intersection at West Amerige Avenue and North Roosevelt Avenue, where he lost control as he turned. He crashed onto a residential property, hitting a palm tree and a car parked in the driveway as well as a block wall and a corner of the home, Stuart said.

The driver died at the scene, and no one else was injured, Stuart said. Damage to the house appeared to be minor, he said.

Orange County coroner’s office officials Wednesday afternoon identified the man as Zachery Medina, 22, of Chino Hills.
