A motorcylist being chased by authorities through two metro Atlanta counties was killed Tuesday night when he slammed into the side of a pickup truck.

The impact of the crash caused the man to be ejected from his Suzuki GSXR motorcycle and flipped the Dodge Ram pickup truck on its roof, according to Cobb County police. The motorcyclist, identified by police as 23-year-old Freddie Allen Few III of Mableton, was dead at the scene.

The chase started in Paulding County about 10:30 p.m. when a deputy noticed the motorcycle had bright neon lights and he could not see its tag displayed, Paulding sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Ashley Henson told AJC.com. The deputy followed the motorcycle on U.S. 278 from Pace Road into Cobb County, then tried to initiate a traffic stop.

“The motorcycle fled at speeds in excess of over 100 mph with the deputy barely being able to keep up,” Henson said.

Few crashed minutes later in the area of Ogelsby Road near Powder Springs.

“A black 2009 Dodge Ram pickup truck was northbound on C.H. James Parkway and was preparing to turn left onto Oglesby Road,” Cobb police spokeswoman Sarah O’Hara said in a statement. “As the Dodge began to turn left onto Oglesby Road, it crossed into the path of the Suzuki.”

The driver of the pickup, 33-year-old Guillermo Martinez of Austell, was taken to WellStar Kennestone Hospital for treatment. His injuries are not considered life-threatening, O’Hara said.

Debris from the collision struck another Dodge Ram pickup stopped on C.H. James Parkway but did not injure its driver.

“While the investigation is still ongoing, investigators believe excessive speed is a contributing factor in the collision and do not expect to file charges,” O’Hara said.

Anyone with information about the crash is asked to contact Cobb County police’s traffic investigation unit at 770-499-3987.
