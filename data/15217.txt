HATTIESBURG, Miss. - A former Mississippi Highway Patrol officer involved in a 2014 fatal crash in Hattiesburg has been indicted for manslaughter.

WDAM-TV reports Jonathan Edward Johnson was arrested Friday after a Forrest County Grand Jury handed up the indictment. It was unknown if he has an attorney.

According to the indictment, Johnson did unlawfully and feloniously kill and slay 81-year-old Thelma Gill, a human being, without malice, by his culpable negligence while he was engaged in the perpetration of the crime of speeding.

According to the Hattiesburg Police Department, Johnson was driving his patrol car when he crashed into Gill's vehicle at U.S. 49 north of the south gate of Camp Shelby on Oct. 13, 2014.

Gill was pronounced dead at the scene. Johnson was treated for non-life threatening injuries.
