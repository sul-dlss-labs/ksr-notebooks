A Jurupa Valley man died in a deputy-involved shooting in that city after he brandished a rifle when a law enforcement K9 tried to subdue him, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department reported Thursday.

Rudy Molina, 34, was under the influence of alcohol, armed with a handgun and rifle, and driving around Jurupa Valley according to a report to deputies received early Sunday evening from his girlfriend, a sheriff’s news release said.

During an earlier domestic dispute, Molina had threatened to shoot law enforcement if confronted, deputies were told. Deputies who answered the call found Molina and his vehicle at the girlfriend’s home in the 9100 block of Bellegrave Avenue.

Molina refused to surrender and “entered his vehicle and led deputies on high-speed pursuit through Jurupa Valley that ended back at his girlfriend’s residence on Bellegrave Avenue,” the release said.

Molina again refused to surrender and brandished the rifle as the K9 moved in, and there was a deputy-involved shooting. Molina died at the scene, deputies said.

The shooting involved three deputies and one sergeant from the Jurupa Valley Station. All were placed on administrative leave under standard department policy, the release said.

The Riverside County Sheriff’s Department asks anyone with information regarding the incident to contact Central Homicide Investigator Higgins at (951) 955-2777.
