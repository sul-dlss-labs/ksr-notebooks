Two people were killed during a police pursuit in West Covina early Saturday morning, authorities said.

West Covina police chased a man suspected of a carjacking when the suspect’s vehicle slammed into another vehicle carrying two adults and a child in the intersection of Glendora Avenue and Cameron Avenue, police said. The collision launched the two adults from their vehicle and they were fatally injured.

The Los Angeles County Coroner’s office identified those killed as Gracie Contreras, 53, of Covina, who died at a hospital; and Edward Contreras, 55, of Covina, who died at the scene.

The child suffered severe injuries and was transported to a local hospital, said West Covina police spokesman Rudy Lopez. The suspect was also hospitalized for his injuries. The suspect’s identity was not immediately made public.

Before the brief chase, the Baldwin Park Police Department had phoned West Covina police about a carjacking of a 2010 Jeep Patriot that had just occurred in Baldwin Park, police said.

At around 9 p.m., the suspect, wielding a knife, threatened a man for his car, which was parked at Hilda Solis Park in Baldwin Park, said Baldwin Park police Sgt. Shawn Blackburn.

Witnesses last saw the suspect driving toward West Covina, Blackburn said.

Several hours later at around 2 a.m., West Covina officers spotted a Jeep that matched the description near Durness and Sandy Hook streets. A pursuit began after the suspect kept driving after officers’ attempts to stop the Jeep.

The chase continued for only one mile before the fatal crash occurred.

Authorities closed the intersection of Glendora and Cameron for several hours while the California Highway Patrol investigated the collision.
