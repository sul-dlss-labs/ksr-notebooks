The Alameda County coroner's bureau identified a motorcyclist who was killed in a crash in Livermore while allegedly fleeing from police Wednesday night as 25-year-old James Peeff of Walnut Creek.

At about 11:50 p.m., an officer attempted to stop Peeff on Second Street near Holmes Street for speeding. Peeff immediately accelerated away and turned south onto Holmes Street, according to police.

Peef ran a red light at Holmes and Fourth streets, and the bike struck the driver's-side fender of a Ford minivan traveling east on Fourth

Street, police said. Peeff was pronounced dead at the scene.

The driver of the minivan suffered minor injuries and was treated at ValleyCare Medical Center and released, police said.
