A man was shot and killed in a gated community Friday morning after he reportedly pointed what later was learned to be a gun replica at DeKalb County police officers.



Interim police Chief James Conroy told WSB TV the shooting happened at the Alden Ridge Apartments on Post Oak Drive, just off Brockett Road in DeKalb County. Authorities have not yet released the name of the suspect who died.



Police were called to the complex on reports of a man yelling and banging on doors.



One officer confronted the man and the suspect pulled out what the officer believed was a gun, Conroy told the TV station. Officers yelled at the suspect to drop the gun, he refused and pointed the weapon at one of the officers. In response, the chief said, one of the officers fired several rounds, striking the suspect.



The man was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he later died.



Conroy said the gun was a replica pistol, but the man had several knives with him.
