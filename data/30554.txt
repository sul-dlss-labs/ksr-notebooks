The New Jersey attorney general’s office says it is investigating a police-involved shooting that left one man dead in Sussex County Sunday night.

Three uniformed Newton police officers arrived at a home on Clive Place at about 9:30 p.m. in response to a 911 call, the attorney general’s office said.

“During an encounter outside the residence, two Newton police officers fired their service weapons, fatally wounding the man,” state authorities said in a statement, noting that a semi-automatic handgun was recovered at the scene.

The officers performed first aid, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene at 9:46 p.m., the statement said.

It was unclear what the nature of the 911 call was, and officials from Newton Police and the Sussex County Prosecutor’s Office didn’t immediately respond to information requests on Monday.

A spokesman for the attorney general’s office said the investigation is ongoing and “no further information is being released at this time.”

The attorney general’s office investigates any death that occurs during an encounter with a law enforcement officer acting in the officer’s official capacity or while the decedent is in custody.
