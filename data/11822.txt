Benjamin David Corson, the AWOL Fort Carson soldier who fled from police on Wednesday and crashed his pickup, died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Colorado Springs police said.

Previous reports said that Corson, 27, had sustained life-threatening injuries in the incident and died later. His pickup truck jumped a curb and crashed violently as he fled from pursuing police officers. He was wanted in connection with three mid-September robberies.

Corson was a private with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team of the 4th Infantry Division, and was assigned to armament repair at Fort Carson from March 2010 until this year. He had been in the Army since 2008, and served one tour in Iraq, from March 2010 to March 2011.

Court records show a divorce from his wife was finalized Sept. 4.

Colorado Springs police surrounded Corson’s apartment Wednesday, preparing to make an arrest, when Corson noticed them and fled, taking his cat with him. The cat survived and was claimed later Wednesday by a family member.
