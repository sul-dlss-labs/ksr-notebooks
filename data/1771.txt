The accident occurred late Tuesday, moments after police on patrol spotted a speeding car that ran two stop signs on 72nd, said Sgt. Maurice McCaster.

The officers turned on their lights and sirens but did not give chase, at the direction of dispatchers, he said. They were nearly two blocks away at the time of the collision, he said.
