A suspected bank robber died in a fusillade of police gunfire in The Bronx yesterday, while his alleged accomplice was the subject of an intense manhunt after escaping a law-enforcement dragnet.

Police said William Partlow of The Bronx was shot dead in a wooded area after he robbed a Yonkers bank and opened fire on officers during a wild car case back into the city.

His unidentified partner escaped, which led to a full-scale search that closed Metro-Northâ€™s Hudson line and delayed the start of the Yankees game against Toronto.

The bank drama began just before 8 a.m. yesterday when the two men burst into a parking garage in the Tremont section and stole a blue 1999 GMC Suburban SUV at gunpoint, cops said.

The pair then drove to the First Union Bank in Yonkers, where they again brandished their weapons and made off with an undisclosed amount of money, cops said.

They sped back into The Bronx, with Yonkers and city cops in pursuit.

The suspects ditched the stolen SUV and ran into a wooded area near Sedgwick and Undercliff avenues, police said.

At about 10 a.m., cops said, Partlow made a suspicious, quick move toward the officers, and they opened fire, killing him.
