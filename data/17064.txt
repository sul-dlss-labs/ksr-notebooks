A Phoenix police officer shot and killed a man outside a precinct station after he attacked a police vehicle and officer with a heavy object Saturday morning, officials said.

The man, described by police as being in his 30s, first threw a rock or brick at an officer's vehicle as he was leaving the precinct station near 39th Avenue and Cactus Road, said Sgt. Jonathan Howard, a Phoenix police spokesman.

The officer called for backup, and the man rushed over to the precinct. He threw another rock or brick at the station door, shattering it, Howard said. The man also attempted to hit an officer in the head with a heavy rock or brick as he was coming out of the station.

The object missed the officer's head and instead hit his hand. He sustained minor injuries.

"That officer returned by shooting one time with his gun, striking that suspect and ending this violent encounter," Howard said.

The man was taken to a local hospital in critical condition. He was later pronounced dead. The officer was treated at the scene. Howard said the shooting is still under investigation.
