Officers reportedly intervened and tried to take the man into custody under Mental Hygiene Law in order to transport him to a hospital as it was deemed that he was a danger to himself and others.



An officer reportedly advised Strobridge to place his hands behind his back and the man allegedly hit the officer in the face.



A physical struggle ensued and during this struggle, EPD says an officer reportedly deployed a Taser and Strobridge fell to the ground.



Officers say Strobridge continued to fight with police, but they were able to eventually take him into custody.



According to Elmira Police Chief Joseph Kane, Strobridge said he had taken DXM (Dectromethorphan) cough syrup. He was evaluated by emergency medical personnel on scene and was taken to a local hospital for treatment.



During this transport, police say Strobridge continued to make “unusual and irrational statements”.



Police say while receiving initial treatment at the hospital, Strobridge was “somewhat cooperative”, but then his behavior suddenly changed and he allegedly attacked an officer. Police say another struggle ensued and during this fight, he suddenly became “limp and unresponsive”.



Kane initially said he had been in contact with the New York State Police and the Chemung County DA's office to initiate an investigation into this incident; however, as previously mentioned, since Strobridge has died, the investigation is now headed by the SIPU.
