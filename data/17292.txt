The Adams County coroner has identified a 24-year-old Texas man killed last week when he collided with a Westminster police officer rushing to an emergency call.

Travis Wood Jr., of Sislbee, Texas, died in the Thursday crash at 88th Avenue and Federal Boulevard.

The coroner’s office says Wood’s manner of death is pending further investigation. Investigators say Wood was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.

The Westminster police department has identified the officer involved in the crash as Senior Police Officer Kevin Parnell who has been with the department since 2010.

Parnell was seriously injured in the wreck. He was subsequently treated and released at a hospital.

Police say a preliminary investigation determined that the officer was using his siren or emergency lights when the crash happened.

Parnell had been called about an armed suspect on the 8400 block of Federal Boulevard and was headed to the scene.

The officer was southbound on Federal when Wood turned west from Federal’s northbound lanes. The patrol car struck Wood’s sedan.

The North Metro Accident Investigation team is still conducting their review of the accident. The investigation is likely to take several weeks.
