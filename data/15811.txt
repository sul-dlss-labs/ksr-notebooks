Oklahoma City Police say they were forced to shoot a suspect armed with a rifle who refused to stand down, early Sunday morning.

The incident occurred just before 4:00 a.m., when officers were called to a reported disturbance in the 3600 block of SW 38 Street.

Upon arrival, they found a male victim suffering from a gunshot wound.

Officers confronted a suspect at the corner of Portland and SW 38th Street, who was armed with a rifle. The suspect refused orders from officers to drop the rifle and raised it toward the officers. He was then shot by the officers and died from his wounds.

Portland Avenue will remain closed between SW 36th and SW 39th until the police finish their investigation.

The gunshot victim was transported to a local hospital and is expected to survive.

Police have not released the names of those involved.
