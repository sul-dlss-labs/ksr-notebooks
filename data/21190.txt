The family of a man who died after his bicycle was struck by a police cruiser has sued the officer who was driving, along with the police department.

In a lawsuit filed on Sept. 19 in Bay County Circuit Court, the Estate of John Watson, through his personal representative and mother, Linda Watson, seek more than $25,000 in damages from officer Eric Williams and the Bay City Police Department.

Police Chief Michael J. Cecchini told The Times previously that a lawsuit was expected and that he would not comment on pending litigation.Watson, whom the lawsuit says was a resident of Bridgeport and also had a local address of 108 S. Birney St., died after the accident during a storm on June 15.

According to the lawsuit, Watson was "riding a bicycle in a careful and prudent manner" on South Water Street when he was struck by the Chevy Impala police car, which Williams was "driving in a careless, reckless and grossly negligent manner."

An investigation by Michigan State Police revealed that Watson had ridden into the roadway in front of the cruiser, which was traveling at a speed between 36 and 45 mph in the 25-mph zone. Watson was pedaling his BMX bicycle along Water Street, north of 19th Street, when the crash occurred about 10:30 p.m.

Officer Williams was headed down Water Street to respond to a call about an argument in progress, according to the report, when the accident occurred. Police say there were no reflectors on Watson's bike but his family members told The Times they are sure there were.

The lawsuit accuses Williams of failing to brake in time to avoid the collision and failing to "give and audible warning" of his approach.

No hearing dates have yet been set in the matter.

After a brief leave of absence during an internal investigation, Williams, a seven-year veteran of the force, has returned to full duty.
