Cape Coral Police Department responded to a disturbance outside a home in north Cape Coral Thursday night, where interim Chief Anthony Sizemore says responding officers shot and killed a man who was armed with a gun.

Cape Coral police went to a home in the 2600 block of NW 9th St near the intersection with NW 28th Ave and NW 8th Terrace.

During a news conference, the chief confirmed two officers encountered a man with a gun outside the home and took cover before the man confronted both officers. Both officers shot at the man, who died of gunshot injuries.

The suspect was later identified as Christopher J. Lefande, 49.

No officers were injured.

Both officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave following standard department policy.

This is still an active scene with roadblocks.
