CLEVELAND, Ohio -- A 40-year-old Cleveland man died after he was Tasered by police following a traffic stop.



According to a police spokesman, patrol officers stopped Rodney Brown Sr. about 8:40 p.m. Friday at East 113th Street and Benham Avenue, near his home.



Brown "became uncooperative and combative," Sgt. Keith Campbell said.



He then ran. Officers caught him a block and a half away, where he resisted arrest until more officers arrived and Brown was stunned with a Taser.



Paramedics were called, which is routine after a Taser is used. Brown appeared to suffer from cardiac arrest and was taken to University Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 10:25 p.m., medical examiner's spokesman Powell Caesar said.

The Cuyahoga County medical examiner's office will rule on what caused the death.

Brown lived in the 3600 block of East 113th Street.
