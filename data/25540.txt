A man killed Monday in a motorcycle crash following a chase by lawmen has now been identified.

The Jefferson County Coroner’s Office identified the victim as William Elliot Junior Johnson. He was 26 and lived in Bessemer.

It began shortly before 2:15 p.m. when, authorities say, the Blount County Sheriff’s Office became involved in a pursuit of three motorcycles on Interstate 65 southbound, said Trooper Cpl. Steve Smith. Police radio traffic indicated the pursuit speeds reached more than 100 mph.

An Alabama State Trooper was informed of the pursuit and was set up to assist when the bikes came by him, Smith said. The pursuit entered into Jefferson County where the three motorcyclists split up. The trooper stayed with one of the bikes and was able to stop him and take him into custody on Mt. Olive Rd just off I-65. The other two motorcycles continued south and were no longer being pursued by troopers, Smith said.

A short time later, troopers were advised that a motorcycle crashed at the intersection of U.S. 31 and Vulcan Drive in Gardendale. “It is believed that this may have been one of the motorcycles who failed to stop on I-65,’’ Smith said in a statement. “The motorcycle that crashed was not being actively pursued by State Troopers at the time of that crash. The driver of the motorcycle was killed as a result of that crash.”

Smith said Johnson was observed traveling in excess of 100 mph by another agency on U.S. 31 about four minutes before the reported crash. The fatal driver was not being pursued by anyone when he crashed.

Chief Deputy Coroner Bill Yates said Johnson was traveling south at a high rate of speed when the driver of a northbound Kia turned left in the front of the motorcyclist. Johnson tried to stop but was unsuccessful and struck the Kia on the passenger’s side. He was pronounced dead on the scene at 2:20 p.m.

The crash remains under investigation.
