MOMBASA, KENYA —One person was killed in the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa yesterday after youths rioted to protest the killing of an alleged Islamist militant.

Unidentified gunmen shot and killed Hassan Guti on Saturday as he was driving in the city with his wife and niece. Riots broke out yesterday after his burial.

Police officially denied involvement in the killing, but sources within the force said Guti was slain by the elite Anti-Terrorism Police Unit.

Kenya’s coastal region, a tourist hub where most of the country’s Muslims live, has suffered a series of bomb attacks in recent months blamed on Islamists tied to Somalia’s militant al-Shabab group.

Police said Guti was linked to the shooting of a senior police officer in Mombasa in August and was facing a murder charge for a separate incident.
