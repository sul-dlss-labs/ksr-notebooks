Police say a man died from what appears to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound during a standoff in northwest Springfield that lasted for several hours Wednesday.

According to Lt. Chad Eutsler, the man barricaded himself in a home on the 1100 block of North Forest Avenue after officers came to his house at noon to arrest him in connection with a sexual abuse investigation.

The man brandished a gun, the officers took cover, and the man then barricaded himself in the home, Eutsler said.

Police spoke to the man with a loudspeaker for several hours to no avail, Eutsler said, and after obtaining a search warrant, police shot tear gas into the home.

At about 7 p.m., Eutsler spoke to the media, saying the man's body had been found inside the home.

It's unclear when he died.

Eutsler did not release his name.

"He brandished a firearm at the officers. That escalated the situation," Eutsler said. "We tried to get him to exit the location. The members of the crisis negotiation team talked with him and had a dialogue going for a while. But after a certain amount of time, he quit speaking to us ... It's unfortunate it ended this way."

Several loud bangs were heard at about 4:30, 4:50 and 5:05 p.m.

An officer could be seen firing his rifle multiple times toward the house at about 4:50 p.m., his gun recoiling with each report.

In addition to the patrol cars, a BearCat armored vehicle responded to the scene as well as a special response team vehicle.

Forest Avenue was blocked just south of Calhoun Street throughout the afternoon.

Earlier in the day, Lt. Robert Byrne said police have had contact with the man before, calls for disturbance and for well-being checks. Byrne described the firearm brandished by the man, saying it appeared to be a handgun.
