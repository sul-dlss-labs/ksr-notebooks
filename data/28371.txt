A man who shot a woman in front of their young child at a Gurnee apartment later killed himself following a standoff with police and a SWAT team Friday evening.

The Gurnee Police Department and Gurnee Fire Department responded around 9:30 p.m. Friday to the 6700 block of Derby Drive for a report of a shooting.

Officers arrived and found a woman with a gunshot wound to her stomach, laying on the floor of the apartment, according to Gurnee Police Department Public Information Officer Shawn Gaylor.

“Unknown of the shooter’s whereabouts, officers risked entering the apartment to save the female and her young child,” Gaylor said.

The woman was carried by officers to an awaiting Gurnee Fire Department ambulance before being immediately transported to Advocate Condell Medical Center in Libertyville for additional treatment.

The child involved was uninjured. Officers determined an armed man who allegedly shot the victim was still inside the apartment and refused to come outside.

Officers made several attempts to speak with the barricaded subject and convince him to exit the apartment, Gaylor said, adding that the efforts were unsuccessful.

Officers established a perimeter around the area and evacuated nearby residents for safety.

The Northern Illinois Police Alarm System’s (NIPAS) Emergency Response Team was requested to assist with the situation.

Gaylor said that a drone entered the apartment a few hours into the standoff to determine the location of the suspect.

The man was located in the apartment with a self-inflicted gunshot wound and was pronounced dead on the scene.

Gaylor said that the 3-year-old is the child belonging to the man and woman involved. The child was unharmed during the shooting.

The female victim remains in critical but stable condition at the hospital as of Saturday morning.

The incident remains under investigation by Gurnee police detectives.
