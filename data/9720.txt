Two Milwaukee police officers shot and killed a 29-year-old battery suspect early Monday and one of the officers was grazed by a bullet during the encounter, according to the Police Department.

The suspect was identified by police Monday afternoon as Dionne Brown and the wounded officer was treated and released from a hospital.

According to police spokeswoman Anne E. Schwartz:

A woman who had been beaten by Brown on Saturday called police after he returned to the home in the 4300 block of W. Olive Way late Sunday.

Brown was wanted in Saturday's battery. He also was wanted on a warrant for violating his probation after being convicted of being a felon in possession of a gun.

Two officers who arrived at the home were told Brown was hiding in a small crawlspace in the attic.

"Officers repeatedly ordered the suspect to show his hands and to come out of the space," a department news release says. "He refused and instead turned to them, making a motion toward his waistband and lunged at them."

The officers shot Brown, who died at the scene.

Brown did not have a gun, but police found a knife at the scene, Schwartz said.

Schwartz said police are still investigating how one of the officers, a 39-year-old man with eight years of service, was shot. The other officer - a 33-year-old man with one year of service - was not injured.

Both officers have been placed on administrative duty while the Police Department and the Milwaukee County district attorney's office investigate the case, which is standard procedure after any police shooting.

In addition to being wanted in Saturday's battery and the warrant for being a felon in possession of a gun, Brown has an arrest record with Milwaukee police that includes resisting and obstructing an officer, escape, possession of marijuana and cocaine, attempted robbery, and endangering safety by use of a dangerous weapon, according to the department's news release.
