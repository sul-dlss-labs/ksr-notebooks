"It was somebody driving by who called in that someone was standing next to a motorcycle and waving a gun around," said Jefferson County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Karlyn Tilley. "We are very grateful to the person who called 911."

When a deputy arrived, the motorcycle was located, unoccupied. During the investigation, a male matching the description of the subject of the 911 call approached a deputy. As the deputy engaged the man in conversation, he pulled a handgun from his waistband and pointed it at the deputy. Shots were fired and the suspect was pronounced deceased.

The motorcycle was reported as stolen out of Westminster in February.
