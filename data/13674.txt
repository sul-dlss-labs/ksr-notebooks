EL CAJON (CNS) - A North County man speeding away from police on a stolen motorcycle crashed and was killed in El Cajon, and the CHP Sunday was still investigating the wreck.

Carl Lee Denmark, 22, of Santa Ysabel, was killed as the bike fell and he was run over by a car at 9:25 p.m. Saturday. The wreck was on Graves Avenue, north of the Highway 67 interchange at Broadway, El Cajon Police Lt. Walter Miller said.

"The motorcyclist was northbound on Graves at a high rate of speed and driving in a reckless manner when an officer at the intersection saw him and attempted to stop him," Miller said.

"The motorcyclist failed to negotiate a curve in the road, and fell from the vehicle into the southbound lane of Graves Avenue and Hart Drive and was struck by a southbound vehicle."

Denmark was pronounced dead at the scene, Miller said. The driver of the other vehicle, a Honda Accord, was not injured.
