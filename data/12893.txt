HURON- Authorities with the Huron Police Department say a suspect has been killed by a Huron Police Officer after attempting to shoot the officer.

The suspect has been identified as 25 year-old Pedro Murillo of Huron, according to the Fresno County Coronerâ€™s Office.

The incident occurred around 3 a.m. of Monday morning when an officer on patrol spotted Murillo on a bicycle in an abandoned alley in the area of Cherry and Los Angeles avenues in Huron. When the officer attempted to stop Murillo, he tried to run away, but he crashed his bike and fled by foot, with the officer following him.

As the officer approached the suspect, Murillo pulled a small-caliber handgun and aimed at the officer. Fearing his own life, the officer pulled out his own gun and shot at Murillo. Murillo was hit several times, authorities say.

An ambulance was called to the scene, but Murillo succumbed to his injuries. The officer was not injured.

Investigators have not said whether Murillo returned fire, but they did find a weapon they believe he owned.

Murillo had prior charges for Drinking and Driving and a warrant out for his arrest at the time of his death.

The officer was placed on administrative leave and has not been identified while an investigation takes place.

This shooting was only the second officer-involved shooting involving an officer in Huron. The first incident happened in 1996.
