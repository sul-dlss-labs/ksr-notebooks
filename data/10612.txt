ST. LOUIS â€¢ Authorities say a drunken driver fleeing police struck two pedestrians early Sunday on the Poplar Street Bridge, killing one of them and leaving the other in grave condition.

Illinois State Police Sgt. Keith Stephens said two men in a 2003 Ford Mustang were fleeing St. Louis police when they struck the pedestrians on the bridge.

Late Sunday afternoon, police identified the victim as Daunte D. Simmons, 26, of St. Louis.

St. Louis police said the Mustang struck a squad car at Market Street and Memorial Drive about 3:35 a.m., police said. Police followed the car onto the bridge and a few minutes later, the Mustang struck a man and woman walking along the eastbound lanes of the bridge close to the Illinois side.

Simmons was pronounced dead at 4:38 a.m. at St. Louis University Hospital. The woman he was walking with -- Elvira Secic, 27, of St. Louis -- remained in critical condition Monday morning at St. Louis University Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Laura Keller.

The city officer, 50, was treated at Barnes-Jewish Hospital for minor back and neck injuries and was released, police said.

Simmons was knocked off the bridge and fell to dry land below, Stephens said. Secic suffered a severe leg injury and was being treated at St. Louis University Hospital for what police called life-threatening injuries.

Stephens said St. Louis police stopped the Mustang along Route 3 at 8th Street and arrested them. Stephens said the driver, Brandon Oggun Garcia, 26, of Florissant, had a blood-alcohol content of 0.16 percent, which is twice the legal limit to drive a vehicle in Illinois.

Police said the driver admitted to living in the United States illegally. He is being held at the St. Clair County Jail awaiting charges.

The passenger of the Mustang, Alfredo Amelco Arand, 31, was questioned and released, police said.
