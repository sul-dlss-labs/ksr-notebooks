BIRMINGHAM, Alabama -- A Leeds man who crashed while fleeing from police last week died Sunday, authorities said today.

Robert Earl Fletcher, 28, was pronounced dead at UAB Hospital at 5:12 a.m., said Jefferson County Chief Deputy Coroner Pat Curry.

The man's 18-year-old girlfriend, whose name hasn't been publicly released, remains in serious condition, also at UAB, according to a hospital spokesman.

The crash happened about 9:40 p.m. April 16 on Forest Road in a stretch of unincorporated Jefferson County, between Pleasant Grove and Hueytown.

A Pleasant Grove police sergeant saw Fletcher's car leaving a house where there is known drug activity and ran his license plate number, said Pleasant Grove Police Chief Robert Knight. The tag number was registered to a different car, so the sergeant pulled over the Toyota Corolla driven by Fletcher in the 900 block of 5th Street. When the officer approached the car, Fletcher sped off, Knight said.

The sergeant followed the car a short distance, but lost sight of him. "The officer didn't go into full pursuit," Knight said.

A short time later, he came up on the car, which authorities said had run off the road, struck a tree and caught on fire. The sergeant, another officer and some passersby pulled Fletcher and his girlfriend from the burning vehicle. Both were taken by rescue workers to UAB.

Police recovered drugs and drug paraphernalia from at least one of the victims. Fletcher, Knight said, had outstanding warrants in Etowah and DeKalb counties.
