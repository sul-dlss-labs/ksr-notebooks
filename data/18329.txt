A Dallas police officer in plainclothes shot and killed a man Wednesday after finding him in a vehicle stolen in a carjacking the night before, police said.

The officer investigating the carjacking, which was reported about 8 p.m. Tuesday, found the stolen car about 9:40 a.m. Wednesday in the 3500 block of Virginia Boulevard in west Oak Cliff.

The officer then shot Garcia, who died at the scene. The officer was not injured.

But police were told that a second person may be barricaded in a home nearby. Dozens of officers, several in tactical gear, were called to the neighborhood to coax the person out of the house.

Garcia had previously been convicted of theft, marijuana possession and burglary of a vehicle. He was arrested in December on a family violence charge.

Police said Thursday they will not release the name of the officer who killed Garcia because he works as an undercover officer.

This is the third officer-involved shooting in the west Oak Cliff area since August.
