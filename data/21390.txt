MONTEBELLO — Authorities today identified a motorcyclist killed in a collision with a vehicle while he was trying to elude a Montebello police officer who had tried to pull him over for a routine traffic stop.

The crash occurred about 8 a.m. Monday at the intersection of Via Campo and Wilcox Avenue, according to the Montebello Police Department. George Rodriguez, 43, of Arleta died at the scene, the coroner’s office reported.

Montebello police Lt. Julio Calleros said an officer had tried to make a traffic stop but the rider kept going and collided with another vehicle. Officers later learned that Rodriguez had been wanted on a warrant. The officer did not chase the motorcyclist, Calleros said.

The woman driving the other vehicle was taken to a hospital for treatment of minor injuries, according to Calleros.

Via Campo was closed between Wilcox and Vail avenues while an investigation was conducted, as was the Wilcox Avenue off-ramp from the eastbound Pomona (60) Freeway.
