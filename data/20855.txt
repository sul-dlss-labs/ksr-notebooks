TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (WCTV) -- A Tallahassee neighborhood is reacting to officers swarming a home in their neighborhood.

The stand-off happened in the 4000 block of Forsythe Park Circle between law enforcement and 53-year-old Michael Lloyd.

Police reports released earlier on Tuesday sayd Lloyd's step-son called police FSU police, saying Lloyd was threatening to harm him and his mother, as well as himself.

What followed was a nearly eight-hour stand off, something neighbors say they never expected outside their homes.

While calling out the neighborhood stray cat's name, Ron Webster received an unexpected response.

"I saw two police officers with their hands on their guns who immediately spun around and looked at me and said 'Hey,'" Webster recalled.

GiGi Poulos-Petersen, also a neighborhood resident, remembers "A policeman rolled down his window and said for me to go ahead and get in the house."

Neighbors who wanted to leave were evacuated, while everyone else was urged to stay inside as Lloyd was threatening to harm anyone who tried entering his home.

Officer's voices rang out across a bullhorn "telling him to come out, that he was under arrest and that he was surrounded," Poulos-Petersen tells WCTV.

"The only solution for the problem was for him to come out," added Webster.

Gloria Kolais allowed police to walk through her home to get to Lloyd's backyard.

"They were walking through with these big assault rifles or something, I wasn't really afraid, you know, I was surrounded by policemen," Kolais said. "But I was worried about Michael (Lloyd)."

Eventually, police used a flash bang to enter the home, finding Lloyd dead due to a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Homeowners are still shocked and saddened by the loss of one of their neighbors.

The case is still being investigated by Tallahassee Policeâ€™s Violent Crimes Unit.
