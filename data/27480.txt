Bingabing was in the Walmart with three other people about 9 p.m. Sunday when Warren approached her, according to the affidavit. He put his arm around her and they walked out of the store together into the parking lot, where they started to argue, police said.

Warren pulled a gun and shot Bingabing multiple times, then ran, police said in the affidavit.

On Tuesday afternoon, Warren was found dead in Greenville, about 50 miles northeast of Dallas. Public records indicate that he lived in Wylie.

Greenville police had tried to serve an arrest warrant for Warren at an apartment complex in the 2900 block of Robin Road, according to a statement published by the Greenville Herald Banner.

Shortly after officers arrived, Warren barricaded himself in an apartment, and officers heard what sounded like a muffled gunshot about 12:30 p.m., police said.

When officers entered the apartment about 45 minutes later, they found Warren with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Public records show Warren had a pending misdemeanor domestic-violence charge in Collin County. Details about that case were not immediately available.

Warren was sentenced in September to 10 years of probation for a felony charge of injury to a child. He also had faced three counts of sexual assault of a child and two counts of indecency with a child by sexual contact, but those charges were all dropped, court records show.
