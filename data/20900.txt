PORTAGE, MI

â€” A 30-year-old Portage man who was

has been identified by police as Aaron Tobias.

Police said they are still unsure what prompted Tobias to take off from a traffic stop on an I-94 exit ramp, drive across east-bound lanes of traffic to a concrete barrier wall, and leap from his pickup truck to

Tobias was struck by oncoming westbound I-94 traffic at shortly before 11 p.m., and was "dead before the officer could get out of his car," said Lt. Brian VandenBrink of the Portage Department of Public Safety.

Police Monday are questioning a passenger in the man's truck, arrested at the scene on unrelated outstanding warrants, to see if he can shed any light on the driver's actions, VandenBrink said.

The incident began when a Portage Public Safety officer noticed a traffic violation while the truck was southbound on Westnedge Avenue. The police car turned around and followed the truck, which got onto I-94, going eastbound.

"There were no lights, no siren, no pursuit," VandenBrink said.

The police officer activated his car's lights when it got near the truck, near the Portage Road exit, and the truck pulled over onto the exit ramp and stopped, VandenBrink said.

But before the officer could make contact with the driver, the man drove off, VandenBrink said, turning around to cut across the grass near the exit, back onto the highway, cutting straight across the highway to the barrier wall. He parked at the wall and jumped out.

The man scaled the low wall and attempted to cross all lanes of westbound traffic, making it into the second or third lane before he was struck by a westbound passenger car and killed, VandenBrink said.

The driver of that car was not injured.

VandenBrink said other details of the crash are under investigation by crash reconstructionists at Michigan State Police
