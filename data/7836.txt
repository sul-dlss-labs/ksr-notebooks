The Record

STOCKTON - The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office has released the names of four deputies involved in an incident last week that preceded the death of a Stockton man.

Garrett Wade Jones Jr., 45, died Feb. 2 after a confrontation with deputies who had been called to the 2600 block of De Ovan Avenue on a report that he was causing a disturbance and had stolen a bicycle.

Jones ran from them, was shot with a stun gun, which may have been deflected by a thick leather jacket, and was eventually wrestled to the ground and physically restrained. A witness said deputies hit Jones with their batons.

Jones began to have trouble breathing and later died. An investigation of his death is under way.

The Sheriff's Office identified the deputies involved as:

» Dean Thayer, a 21-year veteran.

» Aaron Dunsing, a seven-year veteran.

» Caleb Lind, who has been with the Sheriff's Office nearly three years.

» Frank Mehrer, who has been with the Sheriff's Office for five months.

All four were placed on paid administrative leave at the outset of the investigation.

Deputy Les Garcia, a spokesman for the Sheriff's Office, said an official cause of death has not been determined. Officials are waiting for the results of tissue and toxicology analyses, he said.
