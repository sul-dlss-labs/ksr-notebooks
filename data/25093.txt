Local News New Hampshire man shot by Auburn police dies "Video captured the officers repeatedly shouting, 'Drop the gun,' 'Don’t do it,' and, 'Let us help you.'"

A New Hampshire man who was holding a sawed-off rifle when he was shot by Auburn police Wednesday afternoon has died, Worcester County District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said Thursday.

Joseph Loughery, 59, of Dublin, was pronounced dead after he was brought to UMass Memorial Medical Center in Worcester following the confrontation at a 380 Southbridge St. gas station, according to a statement from Early’s office.

Officials said Loughery “was shot by police after he ignored repeated commands by the officers to disarm.”

Around 11 a.m. Wednesday, one of Loughery’s relatives, who had earlier told Dublin police he was missing, called authorities requesting a welfare check, the statement said. The relative used a cell phone app to track Loughery’s pickup truck to Auburn, where police were told to be on the lookout for him.

Auburn police officers approached Loughery, found sitting in his truck, in the parking lot of the Shell gas station around 1:15 p.m., according to Early’s office.

“Mr. Loughery was holding a sawed-off .22-caliber rifle and moving his arms while officers shouted for him to disarm,” the statement said. “Witnesses heard and video captured the officers repeatedly shouting, ‘Drop the gun,’ ‘Don’t do it,’ and, ‘Let us help you.'”

Warning: Video depicts violence.

The officers were not injured, officials said. They have been placed on leave because of department policy while authorities investigate, according to Early’s office.

The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner was expected to perform an autopsy on Loughery Thursday.
