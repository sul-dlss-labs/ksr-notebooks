ROSWELL, Ga. – A standoff in a quiet Roswell neighborhood March 15 ended with a gunman dead after several hours of negotiations.

Police were called to a home on Ridgefield Drive, in the North Point neighborhood off Coleman Road in Roswell at 8:40 p.m. after reports came in of gunshots. Two officers pulled up to see a woman, the homeowner, fleeing the home. Her boyfriend, Michael Marselle, 45, was still in the house and shot at the officers as they arrived.

“Neighbors heard several gunshots and a person screaming,” said Lisa Holland, Roswell Police spokeswoman. “He shot at us and we shot back at him.”

The North Fulton SWAT team was assembled around the home and negotiators were called in. No more shots were fired after the initial exchange, however police were unable to make contact with Marselle.

He was found dead in the garage at 1:30 a.m.

“When the SWAT team moved in on the house, they located him in the garage,” said Holland.

The medical examiner’s office confirmed he was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest. No determination was made whether the fatal wound was self-inflicted or came from police fire.

The investigation was turned over to the Georgia Bureau of Investigations.
