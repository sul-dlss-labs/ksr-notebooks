BUCKEYE, AZ — One suspect is dead and law enforcement are searching for a second suspect after a Department of Public Safety trooper was involved in a shooting in the West Valley late Saturday night.

According to DPS officials, a trooper was trying to pull over a Chrysler minivan heading north on Jackrabbit Trail for speeding, but when the driver failed to stop, a brief pursuit followed. The vehicle flipped near Jackrabbit Trail and Lewis Avenue and two suspects got out.

One of the suspects, 40-year-old Jose German, pulled out a gun and fired at the trooper, who returned fire and struck German, police said.

Authorities say German died after the exchange of gunfire, and the second suspect fled into the desert and is still outstanding Sunday evening. Additional details regarding the second suspect were not immediately available.

DPS Captain Jesse Galvez said the trooper involved in the shooting had minor injuries but did not require hospitalization.

According to DPS, German has a history of arrests including an active felony warrant for failure to appear for sentencing due to drug-related charges and a misdemeanor warrant for driving while suspended.

An ABC15 viewer who wishes to remain anonymous sent a video of the moments leading up to the shooting on Jackrabbit Trail. Throughout the video, you can hear a woman saying, "he's got a gun!"

This is the ninth law enforcement-involved shooting in the Valley so far this year.
