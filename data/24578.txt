A motorcyclist has died after trying to hook Fridley police into a high-speed chase Tuesday. He reached speeds of 100-plus miles per hour before crashing into a car.

Friends and relatives are mourning the death of Zach Mcgee, 18, of New Brighton, who suffered severe injuries on University Avenue and was taken by ambulance to HCMC, police said.

“Zach Mcgee just know ima keep my head straight and make you proud,” his twin, Dayton McGee, wrote on Facebook. Police confirmed the motorcyclist’s identity Wednesday morning.

Police said Mcgee was spotted on University Avenue near 61st Avenue “driving recklessly [and] exhibiting conduct that would suggest that he wanted the police to attempt to stop him.”

A police sergeant activated his emergency lights, and Mcgee fled south on University.

Out of “safety concerns,” no police pursuit was initiated, the police statement said.

Mcgee, who was not wearing a helmet, continued speeding south on University Avenue for about 1½ miles, disregarded stop lights and using turn lanes to roar past traffic. A witness told police that the motorcyclist ran the red light at 49th Avenue at more than 100 mph and struck a car that was going through the intersection.

The car’s driver was treated for minor injuries.
