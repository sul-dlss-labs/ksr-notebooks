LAS VEGAS (AP) — Authorities say a 25-year-old motorist shot by a California Highway Patrol officer after a more than two-hour, two-state interstate highway chase died of a gunshot wound to the head.

Clark County coroner's officials released the cause of death for Fresno, California resident Phia W. Vang on Tuesday. The shooting happened at about 6:30 p.m. Thursday on a state highway off Interstate 15 in Jean, Nevada.

Police say Vang was driving a Toyota FJ Cruiser and led CHP officers on I-15 from California to Nevada before exiting in Jean, about 30 miles from Las Vegas.

Las Vegas police Capt. Matt McCarthy says Vang became boxed in before accelerating in reverse, striking the CHP vehicle.

That's when McCarthy says the California officer fired one shot.

The officer's name hasn't been released.
