After an overnight standoff in Rancho Cucamonga with a suspect in a Riverside man’s fatal shooting, police entered the home and found a body inside.

Riverside police say Ryan Baillie, 19, was the gunman in the death of Johnny Casper Jr., a father of four and son of a former Norco mayor, and the wounding of Gregory Loza, Casper’s brother-in-law.

Police arrested Larry Miller, 30, of Norco on Tuesday in connection with the incident.

Riverside officers surrounded the home of Baillie’s mother Wednesday afternoon and called San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies and SWAT team members to the home Thursday morning. They shot a canister of tear gas into the home, but no one emerged.

Authorities entered late Thursday morning and found a body but would not confirm that it was Baillie’s. The cause of death was not immediately available, but police said no gunshots had been fired into the home.
