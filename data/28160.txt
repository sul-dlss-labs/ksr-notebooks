According to police, the suspect then lunged at the officers.

A 28-year-old officer then shot the suspect once in the abdomen. He was transported to Jefferson-Torresdale Hospital and was pronounced dead at 5:47 p.m.

"Honestly, my stomach is in knots," witness Brittany Charles said.

Charles works nearby and says she saw the entire thing unfold as she was on a Facetime call with a friend.

"When I first seen it, I seen he was angry, he was enraged about something. He was walking up on the cops. The cops did have his gun pointed at him," Charles said.

She says she simply wishes the outcome was different.

"Somebody could have grabbed him and detained him or something," Charles said.

Authorities say the officer who shot the suspect is a seven-year veteran of the force. No officers or bystanders were injured.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing.
