At around 11:25 am, officials began the chase after a Newton County Police officer discovered the driver of a Passat stolen out of Mississippi was fleeing on I-20 West near the exit.

GSP reported the driver, who has been identified as 30-year old Ronreaco W. Bailey, "drove extremely recklessly and with disregard to the safety of others."

"The driver exited off I-20 West at exit 74 disregarding another red traffic signal at the intersection with Evans Mill Road. The pursuit continued west on Old Hillandale Drive approaching the intersection with Lithonia Industrial Blvd where the driver again disregarded a red traffic signal," the report continued.

The driver of a Ford Superduty with a Ford Explorer in tow was traveling south on Lithonia Industrial Blvd approaching the intersection with Old Hillandale Drive. The front bumper of the Passat struck the left front side of the trailer towing the Explorer, the report said.
