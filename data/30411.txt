Police officers in Barstow shot and killed a man who they said was firing a handgun early Saturday morning when they arrived at a reported disturbance involving multiple people.

The shooting occurred after 1 a.m. in the 2300 block of East Main Street, according to a post on the Barstow Police Department Facebook page. Officers were en route to the location when a second caller reported gunshots in a parking lot.

The San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department Coroner’s Division said the shooting occurred inside a “bar parking lot.”

When the officers arrived, they said they saw the man — later identified by the sheriff’s coroner as Kenneth Earl Mackey, 44, of Barstow — shooting the handgun, according to the post, which did not state if he fired at the officers. They returned fire and hit Mackey.

The officers then requested medical aid. Barstow Fire Protection District arrived, treated the man and took him to Barstow Community Hospital, where he died.

The Barstow Police post did not say if anyone else was injured during the incident, or what caused the initial disturbance.

The officers secured the scene and notified the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Detail about the shooting, which is part of Barstow Police policy. A homicide team and crime scene specialists arrived and started an investigation, which is ongoing.

A deputy coroner also responded to the scene and to the hospital “to assist homicide detectives,” the Barstow Police post said.

Anyone who witnessed the shooting, or anyone with information, is asked by law enforcement to call Det. Nick Craig or Sgt. Joseph Steers at 909-387-3589.
