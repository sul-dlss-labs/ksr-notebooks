LANCASTER – A man was shot dead during a deputy-involved shooting in Lancaster late Friday night and “a semi-automatic assault pistol was recovered next to his body,” authorities said.

The shooting happened around 11:35 p.m. Friday, July 3, as detectives from the Gang Unit, Operation Safe Streets Bureau, “were patrolling in the 3100 block of West Avenue K-4 in Lancaster,” according to a news release from the Sheriff’s Information Bureau.

“They stopped their patrol vehicle to contact the suspect and his friend. As the deputies exited their patrol vehicle, the suspect, a Hispanic man, took an assault pistol out from under his jacket and a deputy-involved shooting took place,” the news release states.

The suspect was shot in the upper torso and pronounced dead at the scene, and the suspect’s friend ran away across a dirt field and out of view, sheriff’s officials said in the news release.

“The suspect’s handgun, a semi-automatic assault pistol, was recovered next to his body,” the news release states.

Deputies conducted a perimeter search for several hours to find the second suspect, but it was unclear Saturday morning if the second suspect had been found.

No deputies were injured during the incident.

The man shot dead by deputies has not yet been identified pending next of kin notification, coroner’s officials said Saturday morning. There is no further information available at this time.

Anyone with information about this incident is encouraged to contact the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s Homicide Bureau at 323-890-5500.
