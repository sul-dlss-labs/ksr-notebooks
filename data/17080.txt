Man shot dead by Metro cops was wanted on felonies in Arizona

A man wanted on violent felony counts including attempted murder was fatally shot by police today after refusing to drop an object that turned out to be a cellphone, according to Metro Police.

The man, who was wanted in Arizona, was under surveillance by U.S. Marshals when he fled on foot about 2 p.m. toward the 8300 block of Gilded Crown Court, near Durango Drive and Desert Inn Road, Metro Capt. Matt McCarthy said.

Police were called to help track the man down, he said.

In the residential area of single-family homes, two officers came across the man, who was concealing something in his right hand, McCarthy said.

Police, believing it to be a gun, instructed him to drop it multiple times and told him not to move toward them, but he didn't listen to either command, he said.

Officers fired, striking the man multiple times, he said.

Medical personnel arrived on scene quickly, and the man was pronounced dead on scene, McCarthy said.

It was later determined the object police say he was concealing was a cellphone.

The man's identity and official cause of death will be released by the Clark County Coroner's Office.
