A Cañon City man who was under investigation for unlawful sexual contact with a child shot himself as officers approached his home on Friday.

According to a news release, the Cañon City Police Department were attempting to arrest Donald Ready, 77, on a warrant, charging him with criminal attempt, second degree kidnapping, solicitation for prostitution, stalking, unlawful sexual contact with a child and harassment.

Officers arrived at Ready’s home at 714 Grand Ave. at about 10 a.m., when officers knocked on the door and announced their presence. It was after officers announced their presence when a single gunshot went off.

“Officers forced entry to the home and Ready was found inside, dead from what appeared to be a single, self-inflicted, gunshot wound,” a news release said.

The news release said officers and investigators were still on the scene as of Friday afternoon, and were still investigating Ready as a suspect in the allegations listed in the warrant.

No other information regarding this incident and case is available at this time, because the case is still an open investigation.
