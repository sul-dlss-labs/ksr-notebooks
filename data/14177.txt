PERRY, Georgia (41NBC/WMGT) — A Perry man is dead after he apparently shot himself during a standoff with law enforcement early Tuesday morning.

The man has been identified as 24-year-old Robert Sperry.

According to a news release from the Perry Police Department, police responded to a domestic disturbance at 285 Frank Satterfield Road around 1:07 a.m.

A female caller said her and her son were in the home with their male roommate, Sperry, who had a handgun and was threatening them.

When officers arrived on the scene, the woman was able to hand her son off to police through a window on the second floor of the home. She was able to leave through the front door.

After the two were out of the home safely, the Houston County Sheriff Office’s Response Team arrived and tried to peacefully resolve the situation.

Shortly after 6 a.m., police say they heard a gunshot from inside. Around 7 a.m., they entered the residence and found Sperry dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

The GBI has been called in to investigate the incident. GBI Special Agent in Charge, J.T. Ricketson, of the Perry Office is in charge of the investigation.
