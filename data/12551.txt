POMONA — A man who was shot and killed by Pomona police officers on March 25 has been identified.

A Los Angeles County sheriff’s homicide division official investigating the shooting provided the man’s name on Monday night.

Pomona police officers shot and killed John Arganda, 43, of Pomona about 7:33 p.m. March 25 after responding to a family disturbance call at a residence in the 500 block of Carruthers Court.

Arganda was holding a large kitchen knife and refused to drop it despite requests from officers, according to a Los Angeles County sheriff’s news release.

A Pomona police officer then fired a Taser at him but it had no impact. The man charged at the officers and was shot, according to a sheriff’s news release.

Arganda was declared dead at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange.

“Arganda was in possession of a 6- to 7-inch blade when officers shot him,” sheriff’s Lt. David Coleman said. “He was shot multiple times in the upper torso. “

On Monday night, a woman who answered the door at the house where the officer-involved shooting occurred said residents were not ready to speak about the incident.

The March 25 officer-involved shooting was the second that involved Pomona police officers in less than 10 days.

Sonia Angelita Castaneda-Montoya, 28, of Pomona was shot and killed March 16 after reportedly brandishing a gun at a Pomona police officer and two Los Angeles County District Attorney’s investigators in the 900 block of West Holt Avenue, according to sheriff’s officials.

Those officers were taking part in a gang suppression patrol in response to a recent spate of violence in the city. Between March 7 and 12, four people in the city died in shootings.
