Two men suspected of robbing a street vendor selling Valentine’s Day gift baskets died Sunday morning when their car crashed into a parked vehicle during a brief police pursuit south of downtown Los Angeles, authorities said.

The incident began about 4:30 a.m., when two men allegedly stole merchandise from a vendor set up at San Pedro Street and Adams Boulevard.

Officers responded to a 911 call, and the suspects’ Nissan sped away, soon crashing near Central Avenue and 27th Street.
