(AP) - Virginia Beach police shot and killed a man they say pulled a gun when he was approached by officers and refused to obey their orders to drop it, authories said Tuesday.



An officer spotted 21-year old Shane Michael Lester sitting alone in a pickup truck parked near the closed Lynnhaven North Shopping Center on South Lynnhaven Road and Braves Trail at about 11:30 p.m. Monday, police spokesman Mike Carey said.



Lester, of the 1600 block of Sword Dancer Drive, refused to give the officer his identification, and the officer noticed drug paraphernalia in the front seat, Carey said.



The officer then opened the driver's door because "it appeared as though the driver was fidgeting around and doing something in the vehicle, perhaps getting ready in an effort to drive away," Carey said.



A second officer arrived, opened the truck's passenger door and saw a handgun in the Lester's hand, Carey said. The first officer tried to disarm the man, they struggled and the officer backed away, he said.



Lester waved the gun around inside the truck, ignoring the officers' repeated orders to drop the weapon, Carey said. The second officer shot him several times, and the man was pronounced dead at the scene at about 11:50 p.m, Carey said.



The officers were not hurt. They have been placed on administrative duty while the police department's homicide squad, the department's professional standards office and the Virginia Beach commonwealth's attorney investigate.



Carey said police did not plan to release the officers' names until at least Wednesday. "They need time to come to terms with what has occurred," he said.
