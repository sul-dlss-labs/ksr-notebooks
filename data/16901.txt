OAKLAND (CBS SF) – Oakland police on Friday identified a man who was shot and killed by a group of officers after he allegedly brandished a firearm that was later determined to be a pellet gun on Sunday.

Richard Perkins was identified as the 39-year-old former Oakland resident who police said approached officers and pointed a replica firearm at them as they were impounding vehicles near 90th and Bancroft avenues at around 5:30 p.m. Sunday.

The officers, who were responding to one of the weekend's many sideshows, were standing around doing paperwork and waiting for tow trucks to arrive before the incident occurred, police said.

The officers scattered when Perkins pulled what appeared to be a black pistol from his waistband, police said. No communication was made with Perkins before the officers fatally shot him.

One of the officers who opened fire, Sgt. Joseph Turner, has been with the department for seven years.

Officers Jonathan Cairo, Joshua Barnard and Allahno Hughes, who have each been with the department for a year or less, also used their firearms.

Investigators have not yet determined why the man approached the officers. He was not said to be associated with the sideshow.

As for the officers' actions, the homicide section and internal affairs division of Oakland police are investigating the incident.

An independent investigation will be done at the same time by the Alameda County District Attorney's Office, police said.
