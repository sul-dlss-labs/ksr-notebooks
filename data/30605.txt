KSP: Driver of stolen motorcycle dies after crashing during police chase

BEE SPRING, Ky. (WTVQ) – A man was killed Thursday afternoon in a crash while running from police on a stolen motorcycle, according to Kentucky State Police.

Investigators say the Grayson County Sheriff’s Office initiated a pursuit of a stolen motorcycle driven by 34-year old Kristopher M. Burden, of Leitchfield.

KSP says deputies lost sight of the motorcycle when it entered Edmonson County.

An Edmonson County deputy saw the motorcycle southbound on Highway 259 North in the Kyrock area, according to KSP. Investigators say Burden made an illegal turn in the middle of the road, nearly hit another vehicle on Highway 259 North. The Edmonson County deputy then began to pursue Burden.

State Police say Burden turned west onto Sunfish Bee Spring Road and went off the road in a curve, hit a road sign and guardrail and was thrown from the motorcycle. He was pronounced dead at the scene by the Edmonson County coroner.

Burden was not wearing a helmet, according to KSP.

The investigation continues and is being led by Detective Michael Waggener. He was assisted on the scene by Brownsville Police Department, Edmonson County Sheriff’s Office, Edmonson County EMS, Kyrock Fire Department and Edmonson County Coroner.
