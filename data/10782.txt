GARDEN GROVE – Authorities identified on Monday a 31-year-old man shot and killed by Garden Grove officers as Jason Nuñez.

Police responded at about 6:45 p.m. on Saturday to reports of an armed man who was being violent, breaking windows of a home and starting a small fire in the home’s yard near Strathmore Drive and Dorada Avenue, Garden Grove police Lt. Jeff Nightengale said.

Two officers were initially sent to investigate the reports, but four more units and a sergeant were sent to assist as dispatchers radioed information about a man who was armed with at least one knife and chasing people, Nightengale said.

Police found the man, later identified as Nuñez, at the intersection and told him several times to drop the knife but he did not comply, Nightengale said.

Police shot Nuñez and he died at the scene. Police have not yet said how many officers fired their guns or how many times Nuñez was shot.

Two large kitchen knives were recovered at the scene, Nightengale said.

The people Nuñez was reported to be chasing were not injured, he said.

Nightengale said the incident began when Nuñez and at least one person got into an argument.

“It was a fight that escalated into people being chased with a knife,” Nightengale said, but he declined to discuss what started the argument pending an ongoing investigation.

The incident was being investigated by the Orange County District Attorney’s Office, as is routine with any officer-involved shooting. The Garden Grove Police Department also is conducting an internal investigation.

This is the fifth officer-involved shooting in Garden Grove so far this year.

Police asked that anyone with additional information on the shooting call 714-741-5800.
