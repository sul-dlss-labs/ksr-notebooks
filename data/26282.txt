CROWN POINT â€” A 19-year-old man faces one to six years in prison after pleading guilty Monday to a lesser charge alleging he shot a man to death July 7 during a chaotic series of events in East Chicago.

Terrell K. Davis, of Gary and East Chicago, initially was charged with murder and reckless homicide in the killing of Charles H. Foard, 56, of Elkhart, Indiana.

Davis pleaded guilty to reckless homicide, a level 5 felony. The count carries a possible sentence of one to six years in prison, with an advisory sentence of three years.

In exchange for Davis' plea, the Lake County prosecutor's office agreed to drop the murder count.

Lake County Supervisory Deputy Prosecutor Michelle Jatkiewicz said her office decided the reckless homicide count was more appropriate after further review of the case and discussions with defense attorney Matthew Fech.

Davis was in the area of 150th Street and Northcote Avenue when someone began shooting at him, he sped down an alley and fired his own gun in self-defense, according to Fech and court records.

Foard, who has crashed into a utility pole in an unrelated incident, had gotten out of his vehicle and was struck in the torso by Davis' gunfire, records state. Police also were in the area during the shooting.

Lake Criminal Court Judge Salvador Vasquez set Davis' sentencing hearing for Feb. 4.

The chaotic series of events was truly unfortunate, Fech said.

"Terrell is very regretful that while trying to protect himself from being shot at himself that Mr. Foard lost his life. I think the state of Indiana also recognized that based upon all of the evidence gathered in this case, that Terrell never intentionally tried to harm the victim," he said. "We are hopeful that Judge Vasquez will see all of this, see that Terrell's lack of criminal history and acceptance of responsibility provides for a sentence that will allow everyone to move on from this tragic event."
