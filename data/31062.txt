The Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said they received a call just before 3 a.m. for an unknown emergency.

Kalamazoo County Sheriff Richard Fuller said a deputy arrived on scene and shortly after, he was met by a person who was armed.

The armed suspect lunged at the deputy, and the deputy fired his weapon hitting the suspect. That suspect died on scene, and the deputy was not hurt.

Sheriff Fuller said the investigation was turned over to the Michigan State Police.

"As long as it takes for the Michigan State Police to conduct their investigation, the gas station has advised they are happy to cooperate," said Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office Sheriff Richard Fuller. "No threat to the public at this time. Everything is contained here at this shell gas station," he said.

The gas station reopened just before 8 a.m. after being closed down for about four hours.
