A Macon man was killed by deputies late Saturday night after an armed robbery at a gas station convenience store.

According to a news release from the Bibb Sheriff’s Office, 39-year-old Shamir Deangelo Terry entered the Circle K at 2580 Riverside Dr. and walked up to an employee while pointing a handgun at them.
