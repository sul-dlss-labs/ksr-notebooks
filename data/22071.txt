The Jacksonville Sheriff's Office is investigating a crash on Interstate 95 after one of their own struck and killed a pedestrian Labor Day morning.

Assistant Chief Chris Butler said Lt. Jimmy Ricks was northbound in his patrol car on his way to work about 5:40 a.m. when a pedestrian - later identified as 27-year-old Laporsha R. Watson of Carapace Lane - was crossing the interstate. The crash occurred at the half-mile marker for the Eighth Street exit.

Watson was hit by a second vehicle after being struck by Ricks' patrol car, Butler said.

A woman who answered the door at Watson's address said the family was in mourning and did not wish to discuss the situation. Watson was the mother of two, the woman said.

Butler said investigators do not know why she was crossing the interstate as there is an elevated crosswalk near the location of the crash.

"It's the area right directly underneath a crosswalk," Butler said. "The crosswalk is open and functioning."

It is not known how fast Ricks was driving, but the posted speed limit is 55 miles an hour.
