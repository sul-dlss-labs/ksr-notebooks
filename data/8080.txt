The weapon brandished by a gas station robber before he was shot and killed by police Wednesday was a BB gun that looked like a semiautomatic pistol, Chicago police said Thursday.

Ernesto Garcia, 34, was carrying a black BB gun that was a look-alike for a 4.5 mm pistol when he was shot at a gas station in the 6600 block of West Montrose Avenue in Harwood Heights, police spokesman Roderick Drew said. Police said an officer shot Garcia after he refused to put his weapon down.

"When officers are confronted with an individual who indicates he or she will endanger human life or inflict great bodily harm unless immediately arrested, officers are justified in using deadly force," Drew said in response to questions from the Tribune. "If confronted in a threatening manner by an armed individual, whether the weapon is real or appears real, officers may reasonably believe an individual will inflict death or great bodily harm to others."

An autopsy conducted Thursday determined that Garcia suffered eight gunshot wounds in the front and the back of his torso, an official said. The official, speaking on the condition that his name not be used, said it appeared that Garcia's wounds came from one weapon.

Garcia had a tattoo on his chest in the image of a Grim Reaper, Drew said. Garcia was suspected in 25 robberies on the North and Northwest Sides and several suburbs before Wednesday's robbery. In recent days, dozens of police officers from Chicago police and the Violent Crimes Task Force were patrolling the Northwest Side in an effort to catch the robber.

Police said Garcia wore a surgical mask and gloves, a hooded sweat shirt and jeans in most of the robberies and may have worked with an accomplice. Police were looking for a second suspect, but no one was in custody as of Thursday evening.
