The Calcasieu Parish Sheriff's Office says, the woman who died in a crash on Highway-12 in DeQuincy was 50-year-old Donna McKee of Baytown, Texas.

McKee, and her husband, were traveling through DeQuincy Saturday afternoon when 62-year-old Walter Cox of Amite crossed the center line and crashed into their vehicle. Cox, who was wanted in Amite for charges of incest of a minor, was fleeing from police at the time of the accident. All three people had to be extracated from their vehicles.

Calcasieu authorities say they will meet with the District Attorney's office this week to determine what charges Cox will face here in Calcasieu parish.
