COLUMBUS, Ind.-- A man accused of shooting at a Columbus police officer is dead after a shootout with police Saturday afternoon.

The original shooting happened on SR 11 near Garden City in Columbus around 4:30 a.m. Police say an officer attempted to pull over a car that refused to stop. That chase ended with gunshots being exchanged and an officer being hit. State police originally said the officer was shot, but later said they are unsure if the officer was hit by a bullet or shrapnel. The officer was taken to the hospital to be treated for his injuries.

State police identified the injured officer as Joshua McCrary, a 9-year veteran with the Columbus Police Department. He's expected to be okay.

The suspect, identified by state police as 44-year-old Quentin Starke, then took off running. Police spent the next several hours trying to track him down.

Just after noon, an Indiana State trooper searching where Starke was last seen found him hiding in a wooded area. The two exchanged gunfire. Starke was hit and killed. The trooper was uninjured.

The name of the trooper who exchanged gunfire with Starke has not been released. The shooting remains under investigation by Indiana State Police.
