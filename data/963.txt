BOZEMAN (AP) - A police officer shot and killed a man who shot him in the leg during a traffic stop early Friday, the Bozeman Police Department said.

Capt. Mark Lachapelle said Officer Stan Ottosen, 31, stopped a vehicle at about 2:30 a.m. As Ottosen approached the vehicle, the driver got out with a gun and shot Ottosen in the upper right leg, Lachapelle said.

He said Ottosen returned fire, killing Jeffrey Deen Shipp, 42, of Bozeman. Shipp died at the scene of multiple gunshot wounds, said Gallatin County Deputy Coroner Roger Layton.

Police Chief Mark Tymrak said Ottosen reported seeing Shipp commit several traffic offenses as he drove his pickup on Bozeman's north side. Ottosen followed Shipp with his lights on for about three blocks before Shipp pulled over. Tymrak would not describe the traffic offenses, but said Shipp was driving with a suspended license.

Ottosen, who has been with the Bozeman Police Department for five years, was treated at Bozeman Deaconess Hospital and released. The bullet went through his leg without hitting any bones.

Ottosen was placed on administrative leave while the shooting is investigated by Gallatin County and the state Division of Criminal Investigation.

Lachapelle said Shipp's vehicle was not searched immediately, and he could not say whether Shipp had a criminal record.

An autopsy is scheduled for Saturday, Layton said. A coroner's inquest will follow.

The shooting was the third involving law enforcement officers in Gallatin County in the last year.

On March 2, officer Eric Albright shot and paralyzed David Patrick Curtin, then 29, after police said Curtin pointed an AK-47 assault rifle at Albright.

On June 3, 2000, Gallatin County Sgt. Rick West shot and killed Tommy Miller, 48. Miller had just shot and killed his estranged wife, when he pointed the 9 mm pistol at West, police reports said.
