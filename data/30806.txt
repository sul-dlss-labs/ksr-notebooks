A man armed with a gun who had barricaded himself in a Bergen County home shot and killed himself after a negotiation with police Monday night, police said.

At 7:34 p.m. Monday, police responded to a house on Main Street, in Ridgefield Park, for a report of a person that had barricaded themself inside, armed with a gun, Ridgefield Park Police Lt. Art Jensen said in a statement. Multiple police departments - including Little Ferry Police and Bogota Police - were called to help cordon off the area.

The Bergen County Regional SWAT team arrived to help negotiate with the man. Negotiation with the 58-year-old man was “futile,” Jensen said in the statement.

When the SWAT team breached the home, they found the man dead from a self-inflicted injury, the statement said.
