Forest Hill police fatally shot a man who had stabbed and killed a woman Wednesday morning outside a convenience store, according to the department.

Officers were called at about 5:12 a.m. to a report of a stabbing in the parking lot of the QuikTrip in the 6000 block of Wichita Street, near Interstate 20. Police said a man stabbed a woman and then fled to a creek area.

Officers administered first aid to the woman, who was taken to a local hospital and and later pronounced dead. Her identity has not been released.

The officers found the man, who police said still had a knife, in the creek and told him to drop the weapon.

Police said the man did not comply and attempted to harm himself with the knife. The officers used multiple bean bag rounds on the man who at one point turned toward the officer while holding the knife, police said.

Police said the officers fired, and the man was hit. Police did not say how many officers shot at the man or how many times he was struck.

The man, whose identity has not been released, was taken to a hospital, where he died.

No other injuries were reported.

The Texas Rangers are investigating the incident.
