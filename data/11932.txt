Jilberto Gutierrez, a 27-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by police Thursday, Oct. 18, in the 500 block of Hardy Street in Inglewood, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department said Gutierrez was arrested Oct. 17 on suspicion of possession of a controlled substance.

While being booked at the South Los Angeles station, Gutierrez developed a medical issue and was taken to Centinela Hospital Medical Center, officials said.

At the hospital, Gutierrez had one hand cuffed to a gurney, but authorities said he used his free hand to reach for a deputy’s gun, prompting the shooting, police say.

Gutierrez was pronounced dead at 1:10 a.m.

Like all deputy-involved shootings, the case will be investigated by the department's internal affairs bureau and the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
