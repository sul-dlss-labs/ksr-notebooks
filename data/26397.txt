REVERE, MASS. (WHDH) - Authorities are investigating after a 32-year-old Lynn man was shot and killed by police early Sunday morning after leading officers on a car chase from Everett to Revere before firing on them, officials said.

Troopers responding to a reported officer-involved shooting involving Everett police on Washington Street in Revere about 12:30 a.m. found the suspect dead, according to a state police spokesman.

A preliminary investigation suggests the shooting occurred following a pursuit by Everett police that led them into Revere.

The man was later identified as Oscar D. Ventura-Gonzalez, 32, of Lynn.

John Avery, who lives at the home where the shooting happened, said officers told him and his wife that the man driving the car shot at police and that’s when they shot back.

“I came downstairs and I saw them try to resuscitate him in the driveway in the front yard,” Avery said. “It was awful and my wife’s still a mess over it. No one should have to see that, it’s horrible.”

The shooting is being investigated by troopers from the State Police Detective Unit for Suffolk County, along with Troopers from the State Police Crime Scene Services Section and State Police Ballistics Unit.

In a statement, Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins promised a thorough and impartial review shooting.

“I’m grateful that no bystanders or members of law enforcement were injured in this morning’s police-involved shooting or the sequence of events that preceded it. However, I acknowledge that a family is grieving the loss of a loved one today,” Rollins said. “I want to assure that family, the community, and members of law enforcement that there will be a transparent and impartial review of this encounter in order to provide the answers that they deserve.”
