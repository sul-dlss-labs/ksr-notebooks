The Ramsey County attorney’s office today charged a Roseville today in the weekend crash that killed a St. Paul mother of six.

Tito Fonzio Campbell, 33, of Roseville, was charged with fleeing police in a motor vehicle involving death of another person, fleeing police involving substantial bodily harm of another person and first-degree driving while impaired, Roseville police said.

On Saturday, Shoua Vang, 48, of St. Paul, was a passenger in the car that was struck just after 7 p.m. on Larpenteur Avenue near the Interstate 35E southbound exit. She was pronounced dead at Regions Hospital.

Police said Campbell, the driver of the car, stole the vehicle in Roseville moments before the fatal crash.

The Ramsey County medical examiner’s office ruled Shoua Vang’s death was the result of multiple traumatic injuries due to a motor vehicle collision.

Shoua Vang’s husband, Zong Xiong, was driving the car in which she was a passenger at the time of the crash, which occurred less than a mile from their home. Shoua Vang moved from Laos to St. Paul in 1980 and had six sons, ages 28 to 18, according to her son, Blong Xiong.

A boy found in the car with Campbell was identified as Campbell’s 10-year-old son. After medical treatment, the boy was released to his mother, who was not involved in the accident.

Bond has been set at $1 million for Campbell, who remains jailed.
