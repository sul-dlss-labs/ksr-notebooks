DOLGEVILLE â€” State police Monday released the name of the trooper involved in the Dec. 24 fatal shooting of a stabbing suspect in Dolgeville.

He is Trooper Andrew Gorinshek, who is assigned to state police Herkimer station and has been a member of the New York State Police since 2017, authorities said.

Gorinshek, Trooper Jennifer Greenwood and a member of the Dolgeville Police Department responded to 203 Mers Way for the report of a domestic-related stabbing.

The New York State Attorney General's Office reported Monday evening 24-year-old Carson Dobson allegedly broke into his mother's home and stabbed her several times before leaving.

Officers located Dobson a short distance away, police said, and he was armed with a knife and a sword, troopers said.

Dobson refused to drop the weapons despite repeated commands from law enforcement and was tased by all three police members. Despite being tased, the suspect continued toward the officers and threatened them, officials said.

That's when Gorinshek fired his division-issued weapon; Dobson died at the scene, police said.

The stabbing victim was taken to a local hospital and is expected to recover, officials said.

The state Attorney General's Office announced Monday evening it was investigating Dobson's death per state law.

This was the second police-related shooting in the region in the past week.

Last week, state police said Trooper Justin Miller fatally shot Mark A. Beilby, 24, after responding to a report of a domestic dispute in Otsego County.
