Armed Suspect Fatally Shot at 2500 Old Farm Road

September 7, 2010 - A suspect who pointed a gun at a Houston police officer was fatally shot at 2500 Old Farm Road about 11:50 a.m. on Friday (Sept. 3).

The suspect suffered at least one gunshot wound and was pronounced dead at the scene. His identity is pending notification to family members by the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences.

Senior Police Officer J.L. Falcon, who discharged his weapon, was not injured. Senior Officer Falcon, assigned to the Midwest Patrol Division, was sworn in as an officer in September 1994.

HPD Homicide Division Senior Police Officers M.J. Miller and T.W. Miller reported:

Officer Falcon, working an off-duty, extra employment job at 2500 Old Farm Road, heard a female screaming for help as she was being dragged by a male (suspect) to a vehicle in the apartment complex parking lot. Officer Falcon approached the suspect and identified himself as a police officer. A third person intervened and pulled the female from the suspect's hold. Officer Falcon then focused on the male and ordered him to put his hands on the vehicle, where they could be seen. Instead, the suspect then raised a firearm and pointed it at Officer Falcon. Officer Falcon, fearing for his safety and the safety of those around him, discharged his weapon, striking the suspect at least one time.

As is customary in HPD officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions as well as the Harris County District Attorney's Office.
