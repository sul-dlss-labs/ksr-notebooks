DEPTFORD - A man who died when he crashed his car while fleeing a police stop was on probation for an eluding offense.

Andrew B. Davoli, 27, of Turnersville, was killed at 12:12 a.m. after his vehicle swerved across Hurffville Road and crashed near the entrance to the Gloucester County Probation Department.

He was alone in his vehicle, a 2013 Ford Taurus, said the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office.

Davoli was sentenced in April to a five-year probationary term in a drug court proceeding, according to state court records. He previously had pleaded guilty to an eluding charge in connection with a low-speed police chase in September 2014.

The 2014 pursuit began in Harrison Township.

Davoli on Thursday drove away from a motor vehicle stop conducted by a Deptford police officer, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.

"The car crossed the center line and oncoming (northbound) lane of Hurffville Road and struck a tree on the shoulder of the road opposite from Davoli's direction of travel," it said.

The prosecutor's office is reviewing the accident "in accordance with the New Jersey Attorney General's vehicle pursuit policy."

Davoli survived a bizarre incident in June 2014 when he was hit by a freight train while sitting on railroad tracks in West Deptford, according to a Courier-Post report from that time.

Police said Davoli was knocked between the rails and the train rolled over him without causing serious injuries.

After the train stopped, a conductor saw Davoli emerge from beneath one of the cars. He suffered cuts and complained of back and leg pain.

According to police, Davoli told officers he had been drinking before the 4:30 a.m. accident.
