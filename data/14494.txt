CONCORD — A woman shot to death Thursday night by Concord police after reportedly pointing a handgun at officers was identified Friday.

Valeri Hawkins, 57, died after being shot by police at 5:37 p.m. in the 2700 block of Pacheco Street, near the downtown area, authorities said.

Concord police Lt. David Hughes said officers responded after a woman called 911 and said she had a gun and wanted to kill herself. When they arrived, they found Hawkins in front of the home, holding a handgun, Hughes said.

She responded to orders from police to drop the gun by pointing it at one of the officers, Hughes said. One officer then fired in self-defense, Hughes said, hitting her.

Police immediately called for emergency medical aid and began CPR, but Hawkins was pronounced dead at the scene. Hawkins had a history of mental illness, police said.

The officer-involved shooting will be investigated by the Contra Costa District Attorney’s Office, as well as the Contra Costa Sheriff’s Office crime lab and Concord police.
