A man shot and killed by police last week apparently had a history of domestic violence, according to police.

James Jenkins, 44, of East St. Louis, was shot by O'Fallon police April 27 after they responded to an emergency call from the home of his wife.

Police found the body of Adrienne Jenkins in the home. Police received a 911 call saying a burglary was in progress at the apartment in the 200 block of Estate Street in O'Fallon, said Illinois State Police Lt. James Morrisey during an April 28 press conference.

Morrisey said police determined the call came from James Jenkins, who was not staying at the apartment regularly.

When two O'Fallon police officers entered the apartment, they saw Adrienne Jenkins on the floor covered in blood. Soon after, they saw James Jenkins with a rifle in his hand.

The officers ordered him to drop the weapon. James Jenkins turned toward the officers and one of the officers shot three times and struck Jenkins once. The bullet went through his arm and into his chest.

From the moment the officers knocked on the door to the shooting, about 20 seconds had passed, Morrisey said.

Morrisey said an autopsy revealed James Jenkins had self-inflicted stab wounds to his arms and abdomen. He said James Jenkins possibly intended for the officers to shoot him.

Adrienne Jenkins was shot twice in the chest. Both the rifle James Jenkins used and the knives were recovered inside the apartment.

James and Adrienne Jenkins had been married approximately 20 years. Morrisey said family members reported there had been a history of domestic violence between the two.

The officers involved in the incident were not injured.
