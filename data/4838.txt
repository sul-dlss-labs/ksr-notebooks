A string of 10 armed robberies at Chicago-area AutoZone stores caused police to watch the auto-parts chain's locations at closing time on recent nights.

On Tuesday night, two Grand Central District officers saw three men fitting the descriptions of the suspected robbers enter a store in the 5600 block of West Diversey Avenue on the Northwest Side. When the men came out moments later, police told the first to drop his gun, said police spokesman Patrick Camden.

When Cleon Jones raised the weapon instead, several officers opened fire, hitting Jones in the chest, Camden said. Jones, 31, of the 7800 block of South Union Street was killed.

Two other men, Michael Woods, 29, of the 11500 block of South State Street and Levi Gilbert, 30, of the 7100 block of South Damen Avenue, have been charged with robbery. They were also charged with Jones' murder because he was killed while they were allegedly committing a felony, Camden said. Both were unarmed when arrested.

Police said they also are suspects in a string of armed robberies at AutoZone stores stretching back to Nov. 3. Most of the robberies occurred in Chicago, but four were at stores in Hammond, Blue Island, Summit and Dolton, Camden said.

A "mission team" dedicated to robbery patterns was scheduled to start working on the case Wednesday night, Camden said, but officers in several parts of the city were already watching AutoZone stores at closing time because of alerts the Police Department had circulated.
