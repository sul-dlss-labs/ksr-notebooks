SHERMAN OAKS CBSLA) -- Police said a Sherman Oaks man described as "troubled" took his own life during a standoff Friday.

Police responded to a shots fired call in the 4600 block of Burnet Avenue around 3:30 p.m., authorities said.

Just after 9 p.m. officials entered the home and found the man deceased from apparent self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

CBS2's Laurie Perez reported SWAT had moved in about three hours after the incident started, leading to a large police presence. There were also reports a hostage negotiator was at the location.

It was unclear if police ever made contact with the man.

Officials said they heard gunshots coming from the home located near Sepulveda and Ventura Boulevards.

Authorities said the unidentified man was believed to be alone in the home. Family told authorities the man was having "troubles."

"Could have been worse," said LAPD Spokesperson Josh Rubenstein. "There were people around, people knocking on the door when those shots were fired. Our officers were around. It certainly is a tragic circumstance And for anybody out there, that is suffering with some kind of crisis, there are resources."

As a precaution, some neighbors were evacuated during the standoff.
