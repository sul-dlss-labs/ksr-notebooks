A city police officer called to apprehend a man who bludgeoned his wife to death with a hammer Sunday shot him in the stomach as he lunged at the officer with knives in both hands, police said.

William Smith, 42, of the 3300 block of South Compton Avenue, died in surgery after he was shot once in the 4000 block of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Following standard procedure in these cases, the officer was placed on administrative leave, said police spokeswoman Erica Van Ross. However, there was no evidence the officer, a 19-year veteran of the force, acted improperly, she said.

The incident started when police were called to the 3300 block of South Compton around 4:40 p.m. Sunday for a report of an assault. They found Smith's wife, Lawanda Smith, 37, of the 3300 block of South Compton Avenue, on the ground with severe head and neck wounds. She was pronounced dead at the scene.

Witnesses said they saw Smith hitting his wife with a hammer. He also told the witnesses he had attacked his wife.

Around 6:15 p.m., police heard that the man was at a four-family flat in the 4000 block of Pennsylvania and had made incriminating statements to witnesses there.

When they arrived, they found the man with several stab wounds, apparently self-inflicted, standing in the building's hallway. He was holding knives in both hands.

When he was ordered to stop, Smith stabbed himself again. Then he lunged at an officer, who shot him in self- defense, police said.
