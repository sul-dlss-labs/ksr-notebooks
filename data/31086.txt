Deputies shot a man to death who had been barricaded inside his Rancho Cucamonga home on Friday night, then emerged wearing body armor and carrying a rifle.

The shooting followed a lengthy standoff at the home in the 11000 block of Carlow Court. The man, 28-year-old Isaac Louis Soria, had been inside the home for five hours, refusing to come out when deputies arrived at 2 p.m.

The deputies were called to the home after neighbors reported that Soria had pointed the rifle at them.

Details on the shooting itself were scarce. Officials said crisis negotiators had talked to Soria for hours. But at 7 p.m., he came out of the home, apparently armed and wearing the body armor.

That’s when deputies shot Soria. Officials did not say whether Soria fired his weapon. They also did not say how many deputies shot him, or how many times they fired. Whether deputies had body cameras on and were recording the incident wasn’t clear Sunday.

Soria was transported to a local hospital, where he later died, according to a Sheriff’s Department spokeswoman.

However, officials also have not said exactly when Soria died. The San Bernardino County coroner had not yet released information about Soria’s death as of Sunday afternoon.

No deputies or other neighbors were injured during the initial incident or the standoff and shooting that followed.

The standoff led to evacuations in the Victoria Groves Park neighborhood and at a nearby elementary school.

Officials said the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office would investigate the shooting.
