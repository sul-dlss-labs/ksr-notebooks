POPLAR GROVE – The shooting death of a Rockford man by two Boone County sheriff’s deputies last month was justified, Boone County State’s Attorney Michelle Courier has ruled.

Deputies were dispatched to the 300 block of Springmeadow Drive at 5:27 p.m. Aug. 11 after neighbors called 911 about a domestic disturbance involving gunshots being fired within a home.

Authorities said a man later identified as Russell Donahue, 44, shot into the home several times and then forcibly entered the home by climbing through a broken window in the front door, which had been locked to prevent him from coming inside.

Neighbors told 911 operators that screams could be heard coming from inside the house.

Donahue, armed with a handgun, searched the home and found a woman and her two daughters, ages 7 and 11, hiding in a second-floor bedroom. He threatened to kill the mother and himself, and forced the mother out of the closet and into the stairway.

The 7-year-old girl was sitting on her mother’s lap and kicked at Donahue to protect her from being shot. At one point, Donahue lost his balance and came within the view of deputies David Mordt and Austin Schmitt, who shot at him through the broken window.

Donahue was pronounced dead at the scene.

Boone County Sheriff Duane Wirth referred the investigation to the Winnebago-Boone County Integrity Task Force, which then turned the case over to Courier.

The investigation revealed that Donahue’s handgun was loaded, and multiple witnesses and crime scene evidence corroborated the stories and actions of the deputies, Courier said.
