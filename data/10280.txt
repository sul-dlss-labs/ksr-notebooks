Officials identified the man shot and killed by police last week after he refused commands to drop a knife as he advanced toward officers.

The Tucson Police Department went to 43-year-old Ernesto Agramont's apartment in the 400 block of South Stone Avenue near Kennedy Street on June 15 to arrest him on charges of sexual assault of a child and child abuse, police said.

Police for months had investigated Agramont in connection with an assault involving an 8-year-old girl, police said.

Agramont came out of his apartment carrying a large knife and refused police commands to drop it, police said.

Five officers then fired an unknown number of times as Agramont advanced toward them with the knife, police said.

As of Sunday, police had not located Agramont's next of kin and were asking anyone with information to contact 88-CRIME or 911.
