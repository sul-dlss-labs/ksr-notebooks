On Monday, police tracked the suspect to an address on Florence Avenue, which is in the area of Lake Avenue and Southgate Road. Officers got a warrant for the address and ordered the occupants to come outside, according to police. One person, 36-year-old Serena Sublett, came out and was arrested on an outstanding warrant.

When officers went inside the home, they found Howard-Walker dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, according to police.

Police said no officers fired shots during the incident.

“He took his own life, that was his decision. We’re still going to dig into this and figure out why because there were two people murdered. They need justice,” Sgt. Jason Newton with CSPD said.
