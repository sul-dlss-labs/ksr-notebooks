Two men were killed and another injured in Valentine this week after law enforcement responded to reports of gunfire.

At approximately 11:50 p.m. March 12, an officer with the Valentine Police Department responded to a report of a shooting at 230 Shore Street in Valentine. When the officer arrived on scene, he discovered that two men had been shot and a third man on scene was believed to be the suspect. The officer shot and killed the suspect, identified by the Cherry County Attorney’s Office as Alvin T. Clark, 47, of Valentine.

Ricky Homan, 54, also of Valentine, was found dead inside the home, and John Malone, 76, of Valentine was wounded. Cherry County Attorney Eric Scott said both men had suffered gunshot wounds. Malone was treated at the Valentine Hospital and is in stable condition.

The investigation in to the shooting continues, and a grand jury will be convened to investigate Clark’s death, as required by state law anytime someone dies while in custody or during apprehension.
