ELIZABETHTON, Tenn. - A Carter County deputy was critically wounded by a man who another officer fatally shot.

The Kingsport Times-News reported that Carter County Sheriff Chris Mathes identified the wounded officer as Deputy Stephanie Simpson.

She was sent to a home near Watauga Saturday afternoon after the department received a call about a fight.

Mathes said Simpson was met by Phillip Hyder Sr., who shot her in the face with a .309-caliber rifle.

Mathes said Lt. Harvey Guess shot and killed Hyder.

Mathes said Simpson was able to sit in a chair for a while at a hospital on Monday, but has a long way to go in her recovery.

The deputy's police dog was also shot and underwent surgery at an animal hospital.
