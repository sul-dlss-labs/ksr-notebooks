ST. CLAIR SHORES, MI -- State police are investigating a fatal motorcycle crash involving a St. Clair Shores police officer who was attempting to make a traffic stop when the collision occurred.

The motorcyclist, 20-year-old James Bush, was killed in the crash about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday.

The St. Clair Shores police officer was eastbound on Eight Mile approaching Intestate 94 when he saw a vehicle pass in the opposite direction with no headlights on, state police Lt. Calvin Hart told MLive Detroit. The officer made a U-turn and began heading west. While following the vehicle in preparation to make a traffic stop, the other vehicle turned left off Eight Mile into a driveway and the officer followed, at which point Bush crashed into the front-passenger side of the police car, Hart said.

State police say there is dash-cam footage of the crash that is under review as part of the investigation.

The officer is on paid administrative leave while the investigation into the crash is completed.

"This was a tragic accident and was not the result of a police pursuit," Police Chief Todd Woodcox said in a prepared statement following the crash. "Our city grieves for the family and their tragic loss of a loved one."

Relatives told WDIV-TV, Channel 4 News that Bush, a 2013 Lake Shore High School graduate and hunter, was driving to his mother's home for dinner after having left his job when the crash occurred.

"Bush was a free spirit who would befriend anyone he met," says the description for an online fundraiser set up by Bush's girlfriend to help the family with funeral expenses. "He was such a lovable man who enjoyed living on the edge."

As of Tuesday morning, $12,385 had been raised for Bush's family to pay funeral costs.
