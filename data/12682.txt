Police on Tuesday worked to find out more about the backgrounds of the two men wounded and one man killed in an overnight shootout with officers in West Baltimore.

The incident took place about 10 p.m. Monday after two officers on foot patrol in the 2700 block of Edmondson Ave. saw gunfire coming out of a bronze sedan, police said.

The officers fired on the car, police said. All three men shot were in the vehicle, police said.

Police did not know the dead manâ€™s identity Tuesday and were running his fingerprints through databases. They did not release the identities of the injured men. Both men are in serious condition at area hospitals, Baltimore police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

City police officers fired shots for the ninth time this year, killing one man and wounding another. The latest incident occurred on the 2700 block of Edmondson Avenue on Monday, April 22 at about 10 p.m. Western District police officers Lester Manuyag and Alejandro Pena were on foot when they came upon men in a car, shooting at something.
