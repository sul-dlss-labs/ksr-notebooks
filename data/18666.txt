FORSYTH COUNTY, Ga. — The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office and the GBI are investigating a deadly deputy-involved shooting in Cumming.

Deputies said Jason Aldridge, 44, threatened them after a woman called for help at an RV park on Shady Grove Road Sunday night.

A 911 caller told dispatch Aldridge had a knife.

Deputies said Aldridge was still holding the knife when they arrived, and they ordered him to drop it.

When he did not, shots were fired, deputies said.

"The officer was in close proximity to a person armed with a knife, and the officer took the action he believed was necessary to protect himself and others," Sheriff Ron Freeman said.

Channel 2's Tom Regan learned Aldridge later died.

The deputies involved in the shooting are on paid administrative leave.

Neighbors say they want to know more about what happened.

"I was surprise and a little bit frightened," one neighbor said.
