A robbery suspect who was shot and killed by a police officer in a TriBeCa subway tunnel on Sunday was a repeat offender who was released from prison in April after spending most of the last 13 years behind bars, the authorities said yesterday.

The suspect, Juan Aponte Huerta, 47, of Putnam Avenue in Bushwick, Brooklyn, did not run just a few feet onto the tracks, as police officials initially thought, but led officers on a 100-yard chase into the dark, sooty tunnel and back, the police said yesterday.

Shortly before noon on Sunday, a 66-year-old man approached two police officers at Chambers and Church Streets and said he had been beaten and robbed, the police said. The officers saw Mr. Huerta running toward West Broadway, where he entered the subway station, they said.

Mr. Huerta then ran the length of the uptown platform, jumping to the tracks and leading one of the officers, a sergeant, into the tunnel, the police said. He then doubled back along the uptown tracks, where the other officer was waiting at the station, his back to a stopped No. 3 train. The officer yelled, ''Stop! Stop!'' and Mr. Huerta kept approaching, saying, ''You're going to have to shoot me,'' the police said yesterday.
