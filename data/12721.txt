ALAMOGORDO, N.M. (AP) – An Otero County grand jury has concluded police were justified in fatally shooting a 19-year-old man outside Tularosa Elementary School during a late-night encounter.

The Alamogordo Daily News reports that the decision was returned Wednesday in the death of Jesse Vigil of Tularosa on April 30.

The shooting occurred after a Tularosa police officer recognized Vigil while he was checking on the school during an electric blackout that was caused by a fire.

A State Police report says the officer believed Vigil had a warrant for his arrest and eventually stopped Vigil.

The report says the officer drew his gun after Vigil pulled out a .22-caliber rifle.

Rounds were fired between the officer, sheriff’s deputies and Vigil.

Authorities say the shooting happened outside the Tularosa Elementary School Tuesday night, but had nothing to do with the school. They say because of the investigation, the school will be closed Wednesday.

It’s uncertain when it will be presented because grand juries are conducted behind closed doors and are not open to the public or the media. Grand juries are convened to determine whether there’s enough evidence to hold a trial or, in this case, determine whether police were justified in fatally shooting Jesse Vigil, 19, of Tularosa, near Old Mescalero Road and First Street around 11:30 p.m. April 30.
