An ex-con whose Bronx home was being raided by police Thursday opened fire on cops - and was killed by a hail of NYPD gunfire, officials said.

Marvin (Smoker) Fulford was hit in the stomach and the left leg. He died at Lincoln Hospital after the 9:15 a.m. shootout.

Believing that Fulford had a stash of cocaine, a team of cops knocked down the front door of his Hunts Point home to execute a search warrant, police said.

Fulford, 48, ran out the back of the Faile St. building and, upon spotting a uniformed cop, fired a wild shot from his 9-mm. High Point handgun, police said. The bullet missed its target.

Two witnesses told investigators they heard the cop yell, "Drop the gun!" before he returned fire - five errant shots.

Before Fulford could take aim again, an Emergency Services Unit cop burst into the courtyard and fired twice, striking the gun-toting suspect with both shots.

Fulford - who survived a hit by a rival drug dealer the night before - had prior convictions for disorderly conduct and for driving without a license, police said.
