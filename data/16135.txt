GREEN, Ohio - A man killed by a Summit County sheriff's deputy was shot three times, the county medical examiner revealed Thursday.

Jonathan Colley, 52, was shot in the chin, chest and shoulder Wednesday morning outside his parents' Raber Road home, according to Medical Examiner Gary Guenther.

The wounds to the chin and chest were lethal, Guenther said in a news release.

Deputies were called to the home for a report of a domestic disturbance.

Colley, who neighbors said suffered from mental illness, emerged from the home wielding a large butcher knife and approached the officers. He ignored commands to drop the knife, according to the sheriff's department.

One of the deputies fired his Taser into Colley, but it had no effect, Sheriff Steve Barry said. The deputy then fired his gun, Barry said.

Toxicology results are pending.
