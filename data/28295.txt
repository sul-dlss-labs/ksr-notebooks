NORTH LAS VEGAS (KTNV) â€” Update: The man involved in this fatal shooting has been identified by the Clark County Coroner as 63 year old Robert Blaine Wenman of North Las Vegas.

Original:

A man is dead following an officer-involved shooting at Craig Ranch Regional Park Monday evening.

Officers responded to Craig Ranch Regional Park just before 4 p.m. Monday to reports of a man who had sustained a gunshot wound. When officers arrived, the man pulled out a gun and threatened to commit suicide. The officers began using de-escalation tactics and evacuated the park while waiting for the Crisis Negotiation Team to arrive.

Negotiators established a dialog with the man, and at one point provided water to him with the police robot to encourage him to surrender, but he never put down his gun. Eventually, the man stopped communicating with officers and approached them with his gun raised. One officer fired a single shot, striking the subject. Officers immediately provided aid, and the man was transported to University Medical Center, where he succumbed to his injuries.

No officers were injured in the incident.

The officer(s) involved will be identified within 72 hours and are on routine paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation.
