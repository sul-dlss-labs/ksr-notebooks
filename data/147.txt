Police emergency units, with bloodhounds and helicopters, searched the Bushwick area west of the Cemetery of the Evergreens until the early morning yesterday, but no suspects were found and the third weapon -- or what had appeared to be a weapon -- was not recovered.

One witness, Milton Vargas, 27, who moved into an apartment at 32 Cooper Street on Friday, said he had entered his building from the street only minutes before the shootings and remembered seeing two men -- the detectives, apparently -- standing outside. He was in his apartment overlooking the scene when the shooting began.

''I heard loud gunshots,'' he recalled. ''I looked out my window and saw their faces clearly. It was the two guys that I saw outside, standing with their guns drawn. I saw two kids lying in the street, and there were two guns next to one of them. I told my wife to move my daughter away from the window.''

Another neighbor, who declined to give his name, said: ''I heard rapid-fire shots. They sounded like they were coming from a machine gun. I came out of my house. I saw someone running down the block. There were dozens of people running around. I saw the bodies of the two kids lying on the street. They looked like babies.''

A grimmer account of the shooting -- one that was not confirmed by other witnesses -- was offered by Don Roberts, 31, a resident of Cooper Street who said he had seen one of the officers fire two shots point-blank into a victim who was already on the ground. ''He had the gun in one hand pointed at the kid and a walkie-talkie in the other,'' Mr. Roberts said. ''This kid was flat on his back and squirming on the ground, and he shot him twice after he was down. I think these cops used too much force. But these young kids put themselves in this predicament, with every one of them trying to be gangsters.''
