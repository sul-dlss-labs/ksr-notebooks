KANSAS CITY, Mo. â€” A woman was killed in a two vehicle crash at U.S. 40 and Sterling Avenue after fleeing from Independence police.

Officers initiated a pursuit of a gray Ford Explorer around 3 a.m. on Sunday for unknown reasons.

The officers terminated the high-speed chase, but a short time later the Explorer was crossing Sterling and struck a Lincoln turning left to southbound Sterling.

The Explorer continued southeast and struck the concrete base of the traffic signal.

The driver and sole occupant of the Explorer, who identified Wednesday as 35-year-old Megan Stamper of Harrisonville, was transported to an area hospital where she was pronounced dead.

The two occupants of the Lincoln were not injured.

The cause of the crash is under investigation.
