A man involved in a barricade situation in Winston-Salem was found dead inside their home Wednesday. Police responded to the 500 block of Lockland Avenue on an "unknown trouble" call before 1 p.m. Police said a caller reported someone who appeared to be unconscious lying in the doorway of the home.Patrol Sergeant R.D. Fenimore arrived on the scene first, police said. Fenimore found an unresponsive man lying in the doorway. The man was later identified as Edwin Joseph Castillo, Jr.Fenimore called EMS personnel to the scene to treat Castillo. While Fenimore was waiting, he removed and secured a large, fixed blade knife from a holster affixed to Castillo's belt. An empty handgun holster was also visible inside the waistline area of Castillo's jeans, according to police.Three other adults were in the home while Fenimore was attending to Castillo, police said. Before EMS personnel arrived, police said Castillo "suddenly regained consciousness and stood up." When he stood up, Fenimore could see "a large bulge" in Castillo's front pocket and realized it was a concealed handgun.Fenimore placed his hand over the concealed handgun as Castillo tried to take it out, police said. This started a physical struggle as Fenimore tried to stop Castillo from taking out the gun.Police said Castillo ignored numerous commands to calm down. He also ignored numerous commands not to remove anything from his pants.Sergeant Ryan Hagan arrived at the scene as the struggle continued. When Castillo saw Hagan arrive, the struggle escalated, according to officers.Castillo was able to break free and flee into another room.The two sergeants immediately sought cover outside the residence as Castillo continued to shout at the officers. Police said Castillo is captured on body camera footage pointing a handgun from inside the residence directly at Fenimore.A witness later told detectives they heard a clicking sound as if Castillo was attempting to fire the weapon at Fenimore.Fenimore and Hagan got further away and started establishing a perimeter around the residence. Nearby residents were either evacuated or told to shelter in place, police said.Multiple verbal commands were given for Castillo to disarm and exit the home, but those demands weren't followed.Police said the three other remaining occupants of the home were able to escape to law enforcement officers on the perimeter of the scene. One man was injured and transported to a local hospital.The man later told detectives that after Fenimore fled from the home, Castillo assaulted the man by striking him numerous times on the head with a hammer. The man was treated for serious injuries and later released from the hospital, police said.A warrant for arrest charging Castillo with assault on a law enforcement officer with a deadly weapon was obtained before the police department's SWAT team joined officers around the home.Officers reported hearing a gun discharged from the home around 2:33 p.m. and observed smoke coming from the residence around 2:37 p.m. Both instances can be seen on body camera footage, police said.A subsequent investigation revealed that Castillo contacted an associate during the standoff and indicated he did not intend to surrender to law enforcement officers and had ignited a fire within the residence. Shortly after the visible smoke was first reported, numerous shots were fired from the residence, police said. At least one officer returned fire into the residence window and it was reported the Castillo could be seen falling to the floor and out of the officer's field of view. Officers continued verbally commanding Castillo to disarm himself and exit the home.Castillo then reappeared at the window and fired again, police said. Multiple officers returned fire toward him and Castillo fell out of view again. No further interaction occurred after that exchange of gunfire.Police said the home became almost "fully engulfed in flames." An adjacent home also partially caught on fire and received moderate fire damage. Members of the Winston-Salem Fire Department were already in the area to ensure speedy fire suppression capability when the scene was safe. Fire department personnel were eventually able to safely enter the home and control the fire, but the home continued smoldering into the following morning. When they were able to safely do so, SWAT members escorted a physical to the shell of the home to attend to Castillo if possible. It was then quickly determined that Castillo had died. He was at the last location from which officers could see him.The North Carolina State Bureau of Investigations responded to the scene and assumed primary responsibility for the shooting and death of Castillo. Members of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will also assist with the arson investigation.The Winston-Salem Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division also responded to the scene and assumed the investigation into the assault on the officers. An administrative investigation will be conducted by the Winston-Salem Police Department's Professional Standards Division.The preliminary investigation into this incident indicated that four Winston-Salem police officers discharged their duty weapons during this incident: Ryan Hagan, Brian Ashley, Adam Prim and Cody Robertson. Those officers have been placed on administrative duty, pending the outcome of these investigations, which is a standard protocol for these incidents. The North Carolina Medical Examiner's Office conducted an autopsy and determined Castillo died from a gunshot wound. No evidence indicated that that gunshot wound was self-inflicted, so investigators believe the gunshot wound was received during the exchange of gunfire between Castillo and law enforcement officers.Police believe the community is not at risk for any other danger related to this incident. Anyone with information can contact the Winston-Salem Police Department at 336-773-7700 or Crime Stoppers at 336-727-2800.
