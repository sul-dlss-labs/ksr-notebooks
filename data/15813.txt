Police fatally shot a woman who was allegedly armed with two knives during an investigation into a possible stabbing in Anaheim on Sunday, officials said.

Officers were called about 5:30 p.m. to a report of a stabbing at a laundromat in the 900 block of South Euclid Street, Anaheim Police Department officials said.

Their investigation led them to an apartment complex behind the business, where witnesses told officers the female may have been hiding.

The woman initially refused to come out of one of the apartments, police said.

When she emerged from the unit, she was armed with two knives, prompting officers to open fire in the courtyard, officials said. She was taken to the hospital, where she died.

No officers were injured.

It was unclear what happened to the person who may have been stabbed at the laundromat, officials said.

Two neighbors described the woman as unstable.

An eyewitness to the shooting said the officers were “justified” in shooting the woman.

“She went right at them,” said the neighbor, who did not want to be identified. “About 7-foot from the police is where they opened fire. I hate to see anybody pass away but in this case the police were justified in doing this.”

Some of the officers involved were wearing body cameras, police said.
