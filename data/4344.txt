July 1, 2005 -- An auto theft suspect armed with a pistol was fatally shot by two Houston police officers at 10200 Forum West Drive about 2:30 a.m. today (July 1).

The suspect did not have any identification on him at the scene. His identity is unknown pending an autopsy by the Harris County Medical Examiner's office.

HPD Homicide Division Sergeant L.A. Flores and Officers I.F. Flores and L. Baez reported:

Officers received a signal regarding a low jack hit on a stolen black Honda Passport Sport Utility Vehicle at 10100 Forum West. Officers arrived on the scene and saw the vehicle leaving an apartment complex. Officers attempted to stop the vehicle but the suspect fled. After a short pursuit, the suspect's vehicle struck a concrete pole at 10200 Forum West. As Officers J.H. Kennedy and T.E. Hardin approached the vehicle, the suspect pulled a silver automatic pistol from his fanny pack. The two officers fired their weapons, striking the suspect several times. Paramedics transported the suspect to Ben Taub General Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Neither officer was injured.

Officer Kennedy was sworn in as a Houston police officer in June 2002 and Officer Hardin was sworn in as an officer in December 2001. Both officers are assigned to the Westside Patrol Division.

Anyone with information on the deceased suspect is urged to contact the HPD Homicide Division at 713-308-3600.
