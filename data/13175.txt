HENDERSON COUNTY, TX (KLTV) - Police dashcam video shows the chase that led to a burglary and car jacking that resulted in an off-duty officer shooting the suspect.

According to police, 31-year-old Casey Daniel Smith of Kemp, Texas was killed Sunday after attacking a Garland Police Officer with a crow bar. That police officer was working security at the Walmart in Garland.

The incident started Saturday morning when a Eustace police officer was trying to stop Smith. Police say Smith is the man behind the wheel of the stolen truck seen in the dash cam video.

Not only did Smith refuse to stop, but he rammed into the back of the police car with the stolen vehicle. As the chase continued, Smith made the officer his target. The video shows Smith turning around and trying to hit the police car head-on.

Police say Smith abandoned the truck and fled on foot into Eustace. That's when police say he assaulted an 82-year-old woman in her garage.

"Charging her, striking her in her head, shoving her down, taking her cell phone and her car keys from her," says Eustace Police Chief Kenneth Holder.

With those car keys, police say Smith stole the woman's Cadillac and headed for Garland. The next day, an off-duty officer at the Garland Walmart tried to arrest Smith for shoplifting.

"He deploys the Taser. The Taser is not effective for whatever reason," says Garland Police Department Officer Joe Harn.

Police say Smith tried to attack the officer with a crowbar he had in his pants. That's when authorities say the officer fired one shot at Smith.

He was taken to a hospital and died a short time later.

According to Henderson County Judicial Records, Smith had been arrested at least seven times in East Texas, prior to this incident. Those previous charges were for aggravated robbery and theft.
