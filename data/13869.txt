A 38-year-old Highland man was killed in a crash early Saturday after leading a Redlands Police officer on a chase through the city.

San Bernardino County Coroner’s identified the man as Dominic Sierra. It’s not known exactly why Sierra fled from police. An officer had spotted the man’s vehicle about 11:30 p.m. at Orange Street and Redlands Avenue driving erratically, according to Carl Baker, a spokesman for the Police Department. The officer was initially at a far a distance, Baker said. But the official caught up with the vehicle at Orange and Pioneer Avenue where the officer tried to conduct a traffic stop.

The vehicle did pull over but almost immediately took off, Baker said. Twice the driver pulled over but fled before the officer could approach, Baker said.

As the driver neared a curve, in Highland where Orange turns into Boulder Avenue, he lost control, hit the curb and was thrown from the vehicle, officials said. He was rushed to Loma Linda University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead at 12:19 a.m., officials said.
