Michael Byoune, 19, a young black man, was killed by Inglewood police officers in the 3000 block of Manchester Boulevard about 1:40 a.m. Sunday, May 11. Byoune was declared dead at the scene, authorities said.

According to police, officers were in their patrol car when they heard gunfire. They saw a man running from a parking lot and getting into a slow-moving car. The officers fired several shots as the vehicle came toward them, police said. Byoune was sitting in the passenger side of the car.

The driver of the car was also wounded and taken to a local hospital, where he is recovering. A third person, who was sitting in the back seat of the car, was detained for questioning.

Update: Inglewood police officials said they were looking for a gunman who they believe prompted two police officers to fatally shoot an unarmed passenger in an approaching car.
