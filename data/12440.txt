GADSDEN, Alabama --- A 26-year-old Gadsden man was killed in a Sunday evening traffic accident during a two-county police chase.

According to Gadsden police spokesman Capt. Bobby Jackson, Glencoe police were in pursuit of the man, Otis Jamaar Adams, who was traveling westbound on a motorcycle on East Meighan Boulevard.

At 7:02 p.m., witnesses said Adams ran the red light at North Third Street at the entrance to Wal-Mart and struck a Honda SUV turning left into the shopping center.

Adams was later taken to Gadsden Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

Glencoe and Etowah County authorities were pursuing Adams after a chase began in Calhoun County, Calhoun County Chief Deputy Matthew Wade said. Deputies responding to a burglary call encountered Adams on his motorcycle on U.S. 431 near the Etowah County line. Wade said the man was speeding.

While attempting a traffic stop, Wade said, Adams continued down the highway toward Etowah County. Authorities issued a "be on the lookout" call which involved Glencoe in the chase.
