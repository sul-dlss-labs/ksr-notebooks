LAWTON, Okla. (AP) _ Authorities released the identity of a man Saturday who they say entered a Lawton home the night before, shot a woman and engaged in a shootout and standoff with police before he died.



Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation spokeswoman Jessica Brown said that it was the body of Quincy Lee Webster, Jr., 44, of Lawton, that Lawton police found in the corner of a front room of the home late Friday.



Brown said Webster died of a gunshot wound that appeared to be self-inflicted, but that the state Medical Examiner's office would have to determine the official cause of death.



Officers found Webster around 10:40 p.m. Friday, Police Chief Ronnie Smith Sr. said.



Police received a report of gunshots about 8 p.m., Smith said, and learned that Webster had walked into a house and opened fire.



Brown said Webster went to the house to look for a female friend, who has not yet been identified and whom Webster thought was inside the house, visiting her brother.



A woman, whom Brown identified as Kimberly Bovacca, was able to leave the residence but Webster chased Bovacca down the street and shot her in the back with a rifle, Smith said.



Bovacca, whom authorities said is a friend of the unidentified woman's brother, was taken by ambulance to a local hospital and was in good condition Saturday night, Brown said.



Smith said after officers located Webster, he shot at them, sparking an exchange of gunfire. Webster then ran into the house.



The police tactical team surrounded the home and nearby homes were evacuated, Smith said. Webster was found after the team entered the residence.



No officers were hurt. Two Lawton officers have been put on administrative leave with pay, pending the results of an investigation into the shootout.
