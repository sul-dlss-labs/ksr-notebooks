A Sevier County Sheriff's Office deputy who shot and killed a man outside a Sevierville restaurant in January has been cleared in the incident.

According to 4th District Attorney General Jimmy Dunn, Levi Morton was "reasonable and justified under Tennessee law" in the shooting of 29-year-old Brandon David Bearden outside a Texas Roadhouse restaurant.

"I have reviewed all the available evidence, including body camera video, photographs and citizen and law enforcement statements and other documents contained in the file complied by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation regarding the unfortunate events that occurred Jan. 13, 2016," Dunn said in a news release. "The available evidence supports that Deputy Morton was faced with a reasonable belief that there was imminent danger of death or serious bodily injuries to (himself), the bond agents at the scene as well as bystanders and other civilians present, and/or to Bearden himself. As such, Deputy Morton's actions were in full compliance with Tennessee (laws) regarding the use of self-defense and defense of their persons."

Bearden was shot Jan. 13 while deputies were trying to arrest him on outstanding criminal charges when his vehicle collided with Morton's.

Dunn noted that Bearden was armed and brandished a handgun, which he pointed in Morton's direction during a foot pursuit after he exited the vehicle.

Morton identified himself as an officer and warned Bearden that deadly force might be used unless he stopped.

"In response to Bearden's actions, Deputy Morton shot (him) several times fatally wounding him," Dunn said.
