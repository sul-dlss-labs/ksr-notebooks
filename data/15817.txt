HACKENSACK -- A Bergen County Prosecutor's Office detective struck and killed a city woman Monday afternoon with his county vehicle, police said.

Bergen County Prosecutor's Office Detective Sgt. John Straniero was turning west from Jackson Avenue onto E. Kennedy Street, Hackensack Police Capt. Nicole Foley said.

As he turned, he struck Hue Dang, 64, Foley said. She was pronounced dead shortly after.

There were no witnesses to tell if she was standing or crossing, Foley said. The Hackensack Police Department is investigating.

The Prosecutor's Office fatal accident investigation unit helped with measurements at the scene, but is not involved with the investigation because of the conflict of interest, Foley said.

As of now, Straniero has not been issued any criminal or motor vehicle charges, Foley said. He was driving a 2011 Crown Victoria belonging to the county.
