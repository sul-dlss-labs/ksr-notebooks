Shooting and standoff reported in Southmost

Authorities are investigating a shooting inside a Southmost neighborhood that ended with the suspect dead.

Law enforcement officials are outside a home off Calle Milpa Verde in Brownsville.

Familiy members told Action 4 News that 27-year-old Cesar J. Cepeda was killed during the incident.

U.S. Deputy Marshals were trying to serve an arrest warrant for aggravated assault filed against Cepeda in Willacy County.

The deputy marshals were serving the warrant at a home on Clavel Street where they said Cepeda came towards them with an ax.

Brownsville police said the deputy marshals opened fire and that Cepeda fled the scene.

Cepeda was found in the backyard of a home on the 700 block of Calle Milpa Verde.

Family members are disputing claims that Cepeda was armed with an ax.

They said he was barefoot and shot in the back while fleeing.

Cameron County Justice of the Peace Linda Salazar was called to the scene to pronounce Cepeda dead and order an autopsy.

Judge Salazar told Action 4 News that Cepeda appeared to have two gun shot wounds to his chest.
