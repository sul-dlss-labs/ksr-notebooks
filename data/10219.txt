William Lusk, a 19-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by a sheriff's deputy Wednesday, May 25, in the 11700 block of South Central Avenue in Green Meadows, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Police stopped Lusk and another person in a car about 8:30 p.m. The vehicle had been reported stolen.

Both of the car’s occupants ran from the scene.

Lusk was found in a carport and shot after he “reached into his pocket as if he was reaching for a weapon,” according to the county Sheriff’s Department. The other person was found hiding in a yard and was taken into custody without incident.

After the shooting, Lusk was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead at 8:59 p.m. Coroner's records show he was shot several times.

Investigators did not find a weapon at the shooting location.

According to sheriff officials, whenever an officer-involved shooting occurs, multiple independent investigations immediately begin at the scene. These include separate investigations by the Los Angeles County district attorney’s office, as well as investigations by the sheriff's homicide bureau and internal affairs bureau.

Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to contact homicide investigators at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-TIPS (800-222-8477).
