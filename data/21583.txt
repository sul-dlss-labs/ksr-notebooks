Lowndes County - A man wanted for murder in New Jersey is arrested in South Georgia. Thirty-five year old Michael Lewis is in the Lowndes county jail tonight after he called police from South Georgia.

Lewis is accused of stabbing his girlfriend to death at their home in Piscataway, New Jersey. Deborah Gatewood was found in an upstairs bedroom of the home after Lewis' uncle called police yesterday morning.

Lewis later called Piscataway Police from a pay phone at this Citgo station in Hahira, Georgia; wanting to turn himself in. Then the Georgia state patrol was called.

"When we pulled in he was leaving but we pulled him over and he didn't resist," said Sgt. Michael Reese, Georgia State Patrol. "We put him in the car and took him to the Lowndes County Jail."

Lewis has an 8 year old son with the murder victim. He is a senior corrections officer at the East Jersey Prison in Woodbridge.

He's being held in the Lowndes County Jail on 500-thousand dollars bail. He could be returned to New Jersey later this week if he waives his right to an extradition hearing.
