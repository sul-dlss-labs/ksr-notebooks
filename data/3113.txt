The city will pay the entire amount of the settlement, a spokeswoman for the Law Department said. Officer Neri, who was also named as a defendant, will pay nothing. He was suspended from the police force for 30 days last year. His lawyer, Gregory M. Longworth, declined to comment.

Mr. Stansbury’s parents, Timothy L. Stansbury and Phyllis V. Clayburne, declined to comment through their lawyer, Kenneth E. Ramseur.

For the city, the settlement was one of several recent ones involving police shootings. The city reached an agreement last year to pay $3 million to the family of Ousmane Zongo, a West African immigrant shot dead by a police officer in a storage warehouse in Chelsea. In 2004, it agreed to pay $3 million to the family of Amadou Diallo, who was killed in a hail of 41 police bullets in the Bronx. And in 2003, it agreed to pay $2.25 million to the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, an unarmed security guard shot dead by a detective outside a bar.

City lawyers issued a brief written statement.

“The death of Timothy Stansbury Jr. was a tragedy, and we offer our condolences to his family,” said Ken Sasmor, a senior counsel in the Law Department. “We believe the settlement is in the best interests of all parties, and hope it will provide some small measure of comfort.”

This process of a monetary accounting for a life scrutinized not the actions of Officer Neri so much as Mr. Stansbury, his prospects and his pain. For his family, it followed a hard public campaign begun hours after his death.
