Officers from both Ocoee and Winderemere police departments responded to a home on Calliope Street in Ocoee late Thursday night over a report of a domestic violence incident.

An Ocoee Police news release didn't say exactly what time the incident occurred.

"The incident escalated," and officers used force, deploying "electronic control devices," they said.

Jean Samuel Celestin, 33, was the man who was shocked. Police said Celestin's condition quickly became serious, and officers began life-saving measures.

"They were yelling at the man to get down on the ground and stop, but because he wouldn't get down, there were more cops coming. And they were all telling him to get down, and right after that, he bolted, and after that, he got tased," neighbor Christopher Le told Spectrum News 13.

Ocoee Fire Rescue took Celestin to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The Medical Examiner will determine the cause of death.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate the incident, and the police department said it wouldn't comment further until the FDLE's investigation is done.
