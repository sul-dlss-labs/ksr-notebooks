Two Lafayette police officers fired upon and killed a man Tuesday night.

Witnesses say he was shot as he was stabbing his ex-girlfriend's mother.

Officers report they were responding to a kidnapping call, when they had to force their way into the house.

That's when they spotted the suspect in the act of stabbing a woman, prompting them to use lethal force.
