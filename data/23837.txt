The suspect fled the scene on foot but officials were able to track him down where more shots were fired, involving Phoenix officers.

Officials say the suspect, identified Sunday as 44-year-old Stephen Hudak, was shot and killed in the altercation.

Glendale police were on scene investigating for most of the day following the shooting.

The injured officer has not yet been identified.

The 100 Club of Arizona, which provides financial assistance to the families of first responders who are seriously injured or killed in the line of duty, has already offered support to the officer's family.

"There will be a $1500 payment made initially and within 48 hours to the family over at the hospital if appropriate. We will continue to support the sergeant through his recovery," said Angela Harrolle, CEO.

On Saturday, a Glendale police spokesperson said the sergeant is in stable condition and continues to recover, however, no further information could be provided.
