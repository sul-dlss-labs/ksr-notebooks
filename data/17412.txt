LILESVILLE — Two Anson County sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a domestic disturbance suspect in a gunfight Wednesday night, according to the State Bureau of Investigation.

Deputies J. Martin and K. Beam responded to a call at the boat ramp on Blewett Falls Road in Lilesville and fatally wounded 40-year-old Dennis Matthew Penny while exchanging fire, SBI Special Agent-in-Charge Audria Bridges said in a Thursday statement.

The deputies were checking on Penny’s girlfriend when they encountered Penny, according to Bridges.

Officials sent two guns from the scene to the State Crime Laboratory in Raleigh to be analyzed, Bridges said.

State records show Penny has no history of criminal convictions or pending court cases in North Carolina.

Martin and Beam are on administrative leave with pay as the SBI investigates the shooting, according to Sheriff Landric Reid, who requested the SBI’s help with the case.

“I support my two deputies 100 percent,” Reid said.

A 911 call related to the incident was made around 10:57 p.m. Wednesday, Reid said. The call has not yet been released.

With the absence of Martin and Beam, Reid said the Anson County Sheriff’s Office is temporarily short-staffed.

“Those two deputies are on the same shift, so it kind of hurts,” Reid said. “It puts us low on manpower. We’re having to use overtime.”
