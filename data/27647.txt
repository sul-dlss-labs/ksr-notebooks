The suspect who was the target of a hours-long standoff was found dead inside a Springfield Township home when authorities finally entered it Monday afternoon, officials said.

According to court documents, Andre Simpson, 47, stabbed his mother, Ida Simpson, in the back and neck with a butcher knife before barricading himself inside the Toulon Drive house they both lived in.

Springfield Township police said they were called to residence after Ida Simpson escaped the home and fled to a neighbor's house.

Officers said they made contact with Andre Simpson, but he fled inside the house before an arrest could be made.

Ida Simpson was taken to University of Cincinnati Medical Center.

The Hamilton County Police Association SWAT team was called to the home along with a helicopter. SWAT officers attempted to make contact with the younger Simpson for hours before they entered the home.

Flash bangs were detonated and the helicopter hovered just yards above the house. SWAT team negotiators used a bullhorn to shout into the house.

"After several hours attempting to make contact with the suspect to no avail, they made entry and found the suspect deceased with what appears to be multiple self-inflicted stab wounds," Springfield Township Police Chief Robert Browder said in a statement Monday night.

It is unclear when Andre Simpson turned the knife on himself.

Neighbors in the tight-knit community of single-family homes said it is usually quiet on Toulon Drive.

However, a woman who lives in the same cul-de-sac as the Simpsons said she encountered Andre Monday morning. She said he was behaving strangely as she tried to pull away from her home in her car.

The neighbor said he told her to go inside or she might be killed.

No other injuries were reported in Monday's incident. Police have not released information about Ida Simpson's condition.
