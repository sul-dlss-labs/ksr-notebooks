Columbus police say officers shot and killed a man just east of downtown early Thursday morning.



According to dispatchers, the shots were fired by police just after midnight on South 17th Street at Beck Street.



The man who was shot was a suspect in a shooting involving a woman on Lockbourne Road.



Rochelle Dixon, 44, was shot twice Wednesday night and is in critical condition at Grant Medical Center.



Kenneth (Kenny) Herring, 50 was the suspect in Dixon's shooting. Members of Dixon’s family say Herring was her boyfriend.



Dixon’s brother said that Herring did not care that there were children in the house at the time.



“My children were here. My boys were here, and they had to witness this,” said Gary Madison.



A 911 call helped Columbus police track Herring.



“The guy that shot that girl in her face on the southeast side is my ex-boyfriend, and he is calling me talking about how he needs to come see me,” said the caller.



Authorities can’t say for sure if Herring was targeting the woman or if he was just looking for a place to hide.



The caller told 911 dispatchers that she was hiding upstairs and that she was “scared to death.”



SWAT officers confronted Herring and attempted to arrest him when shots were fired. Police officials say Herring was armed with a handgun at the time.



The shooting occurred less than two miles from where the 911 call originated.



Five officers fired shots during the incident. None of them were injured.
