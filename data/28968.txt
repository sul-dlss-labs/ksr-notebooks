SIOUX FALLS, S.D. (Dakota News Now) - State investigators say the man killed in an officer-involved shooting in Sioux Falls died by suicide.

The South Dakota Attorney Generalâ€™s office on Wednesday identified the man who died in the Oct. 16 incident as 29-year-old George Ludrou Job of Fargo, N.D.

Sioux Falls police responded to a report of a man acting erratically and refusing to leave an apartment on N. Elmwood Avenue near W. Burnside Street. When officers arrived at the scene, Job drew a pistol from his waistband and fired at an officer, according to the Department of Criminal Investigation. The officer was struck in the foot and shoulder.

Investigators say Job then fired at a second officer approaching the building. The second officer returned fire.

The officers waited for backup to arrive before entering the building. When they went inside, they found Job dead with a bullet wound to his head. The DCI said an autopsy confirmed the gunshot was self-inflicted.

The officers involved were temporarily placed on administrative leave following the incident, which is standard procedure for any officer-involved shooting.
