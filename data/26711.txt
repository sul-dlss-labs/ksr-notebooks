HERALD, Calif. — New video released by the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department shows a suspect reach for his waistband before a deputy fired shots that ended his life.

The video shows what happened on Oct. 6 when the sheriff's office got a call about a man in front of a property, who was possibly on drugs and known to carry weapons.

The man, identified as Maurice Holley, 55, was shot and killed by a deputy after the deputy saw him reach for a gun in his waistband, the sheriff's office said. The sheriff's office added that the deputy fired the shots because he feared for his safety.

The gun in Holley's waist would eventually be identified as a Glock-style airsoft gun.

Video from the car camera begins with the deputy, driving up to the suspect who was lying in a ditch along Bennet Road, in rural Sacramento County.

Included in the video release is the 911 caller audio from the deputy-involved shooting, which provides more detail into what transpired during the less than two minute encounter with Holley.
