Two Huntsville police officers have returned to full duty after being cleared by a review board in the fatal shooting of a man who pointed fake pistols at them.

"The board found the officers acted in accordance with Huntsville Police Department policies and procedures and ruled the officer-involved shooting to be justified," Lt. Stacy Bates said in a statement. "Chief (Mark) McMurray agreed with the findings and both officers involved have returned to full duty."

The officers, who haven't been identified by police, shot Robert Young, 45, of Huntsville, at the Marathon gas station on Bailey Cove Road Sept. 17. Police found broken glass in the front of the store and Young inside during a burglary.

The officers told Young to come out of the store, but he shouted, cursed and threw items from the store, Bates said.

Less than a minute after the officers arrived on the scene, Young ran out of the store and pointed what were later identified as replica pistols, Bates said. One was a replica Smith & Wesson M&P pistol, and the other was a replica Beretta 92 pistol.

No one else was injured.

Two officers were placed on administrative leave until the review board completed its investigation and met Sept. 23.

The board included members of the Madison County District Attorney's Office, officers from HPD's training and internal affairs divisions, citizen police advisory council members and city legal staff. The board reviewed all evidence including police and store surveillance video, crime scene drawings and photos, and officer testimony.
