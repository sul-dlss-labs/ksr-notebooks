CHENEQUA (WITI) -- Chenequa police are investigating a fatal accident that occurred after a high-speed chase on County Highway C near Hasslinger Drive early Wednesday morning, August 14th. The victim is now identified as 35-year-old Ronald Beasley of Lyndon Station.



According to officials, Chenequa police observed a vehicle traveling 70 miles an hour in a 30 mile an hour zone just after 1 a.m. on County Highway C, in the area of Maple Lane in the Village of Chenequa.



According to police, an officer tried to pull Beasley over, then he sped up, leading the officer on a chase for a little more than a half-mile. Authorities say the vehicle left the roadway, rolled over, trapping Beasley under the vehicle.



The car in this wreck ended up on property owned by Richard Wetzel. He says he's counted dozens of accidents there since he moved in 13 years ago. Most cars end up in a ditch on his property.



"Well, people have been injured and now killed in the time I've lived here," said Wetzel. "This corner is very sharp left hand turn. You're supposed to do 20 mph."



The Waukesha County Sheriff's Department is assisting with an accident re-creation.
