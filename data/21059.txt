KALAMAZOO, Mich., Oct. 3 (UPI) -- A man featured on "America's Most Wanted" was shot and killed by police in western Michigan.

Mark William Reinhold was shot Sunday afternoon after a confrontation with a Michigan State Police trooper and a Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Department deputy, the Kalamazoo Gazette reported.

Lt. Dale Peet, commander of the state police post in Battle Creek, would not confirm whether Reinhold fired at police but said "shots were fired" and that the suspect was struck at least once, the newspaper said.

Reinhold was wanted for attempted murder of a Sumpter Township woman in Wayne County.

State police investigators in the Detroit area told area police about 11 a.m. Sunday they had information that Reinhold was hiding at a Kalamazoo County park campground.

Officers converged on the scene about noon and saw Reinhold's Jeep Cherokee. Peet said officers chased the vehicle into a harvested cornfield, and Reinhold got out of the vehicle and confronted police.

He was seriously wounded by gunfire and was flown by helicopter to Borgess Medical Center, where he later died.
