Socrates Siqueiros, a 21-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by Long Beach police officers on Sunday, May 24, at the intersection of 15th Street and Henderson Avenue in Long Beach, according authorities.

Police said Siqueiros had pulled a gun on two officers who were chasing him Sunday afternoon.

The incident began about 4 p.m., when officers in a special gang unit approached two men, who ran off, said Nancy Pratt of the Long Beach Police Department.

The chase ended, officers said, when Siqueiros turned toward them and brandished a gun. One or both officers opened fire, fatally wounding him, Pratt said. A gun was found at the scene. Neither officer was hurt.

Siqueiros was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The second man is at large, police said.

Police and the Los Angeles County district attorneyâ€™s office are investigating the shooting, the third officer-involved shooting in Long Beach that week.

So far this year, Long Beach police officers have shot nine people. By comparison, the Los Angeles Police Department -- with 10 times more officers -- reported nine officer-involved shootings, and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department -- also about 10 times as large -- reported 10 such shootings.

Anyone with any information regarding the incident involving Siqueiros is urged to contact Long Beach Police Homicide Dets. Daniel Mendoza and David Rios at (562) 570-7244.
