The July 2016 fatal shooting of 40-year-old Shannon Labit by Iberia Parish Sheriff’s Office deputies following a standoff was legally justified, District Attorney Bo Duhe concluded in a report released Wednesday.

Labit was the suspect in the stabbing of two women prior to the two-hour standoff, which occurred at Labit’s trailer in the 600 block of McDonald Street in New Iberia. He did not have a gun, but he told deputies he did and repeatedly threatened them while holding a knife.

Labit was shot while charging at deputies with a cordless drill, according to the report, which is based on deputy statements, body and dash camera footage and other evidence provided by Louisiana State Police.

Labit held a knife when deputies arrived, forcing them to retreat and to call in a SWAT team, according to the report. Labit appeared intoxicated and repeatedly refused orders to put down his knife, according to the report.
