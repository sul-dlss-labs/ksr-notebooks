AKRON, Ohio -- The 61-year-old man shot dead by an Akron police officer Sunday has been identified.

Philip Hasan, of Akron, died at Akron General Medical Center Sunday after he was shot in the parking lot of his Florida Avenue apartment building, the Summit County Medical Examiner's Office said.

Hasan was shot once in the chest, the medical examiner's office said.

The incident started about 3:30 p.m. Sunday when officers were called to an apartment building in the 1000 block of Florida Avenue for reports of a fight, Akron police said in a statement.

The caller told police that his 61-year-old neighbor had slammed his arm in the car door, police said. Officers found the neighbor in the parking lot behind the building.

As they approached him, he walked to his car and reached for an assault rifle, police said. The man ignored officers' commands to stop, and started to pull the gun from the car, police said.

One officer then fired several shots, hitting the man, police said.

The officer, in his second year on the force, has been placed on paid administrative leave while the shooting is investigated.
