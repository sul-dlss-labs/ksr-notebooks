Woman accused in fatal crime spree pleads not guilty

A woman accused of carrying out a crime spree in a southeast valley neighborhood that left two people dead pleaded not guilty today in Clark County District Court.

Natasha Jackson, 35, faces charges that include murder and robbery in connection with a crime spree that included the carjacking of a freeway assistance truck, the killing of one person and the wounding of two others on July 29, authorities said.

Jackson’s alleged accomplice, Cody Winters, 27, was shot dead by Metro Police during a subsequent confrontation.

The pair is accused of killing homeowner Richard Ramos after knocking on his door under the pretense that they needed to borrow a phone, police said.

Once inside, Winters pulled out a handgun and shot Ramos as the victim tried to wrestle it away, police said. Jackson stabbed Ramos’ wife with a screwdriver when she tried to help her husband, police said.

Jackson was arrested before Winters broke into another home, shot a woman and came out holding her at gunpoint, police said. When she fell to the ground, officers shot and killed Winters, officials said.

Judge Jessie Walsh set Jackson’s trial date for March 9. She remains behind bars without bail.
