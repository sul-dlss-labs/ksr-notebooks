Authorities today identified a man killed Thursday as police said he was trying to evade a traffic stop in downtown Birmingham.

The Jefferson County Coroner's Office identified the man as William Michael "Brent" Watkins. He was 31, and lived in Mt. Olive.

The crash happened just after 10:30 a.m. Thursday at the intersection of 27th Street and Fourth Avenue South. Witnesses said the red SUV was traveling northbound on 27th Street when he was struck by oncoming giant tire service truck.

"When they hit, it was loud,'' said Austin Revis, an employee at a nearby business. "They hit so hard."

Authorities said the driver of the red SUV was spotted by a South Precinct police officer driving erratically. The SUV was traveling at a high rate of speed, witnesses said, and had almost run several cars off of the road. Police said he had also run multiple red lights.

A South Precinct officer was attempting to stop the SUV when the crash happened. There was no pursuit, officials said.

Watkins was pronounced dead on the scene. The driver of the work truck, which crashed through a brick wall and almost into a church, was taken to the hospital by ambulance. Authorities said he had an injured shoulder.

Birmingham police said Friday the crash remains under investigation.
