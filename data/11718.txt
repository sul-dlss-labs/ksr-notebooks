A police standoff with a man threatening to commit suicide ended when the man shot himself in the chest, Topeka police said.

Police officers Sunday night blocked access to several streets near S.E. 8th and Wear after a man threatened to commit suicide.

Police vehicles were blocking traffic along S.E. Gilmore at S.E. 8th and S.E. 9th. Other police vehicles were parked in the area. Several residents could be seen standing along streets leading up to where police had the roads blocked.

Topeka police Sgt. Jay Junghans said negotiators were called to the area because a man had threatened suicide.

About 9:30 p.m., large lights were brought to the area to help illuminate a house where the man was reportedly staying.

Police Sgt. Jack Mackey said Monday morning that the situation didn’t end until after 1 a.m., when the man shot himself in the chest. Mackey didn’t yet know the man’s condition.

Although the man was holding himself hostage, Mackey said, no other individuals were in danger inside the house.

No other information was available as of 6 a.m. Monday.
