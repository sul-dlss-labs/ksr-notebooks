A Downey man who was driving under the influence of marijuana and alcohol when he killed two people in a high-speed crash was sentenced Friday to 15 years to life in prison.

Jon David Tafoya, 28, was convicted of murder Jan. 24 in the Mission Viejo crash on April 5, 2005.

Tafoya had been attempting to evade Orange County sheriffâ€™s deputies as they tried to pull him over for suspected drunk driving after leaving Tortilla Flats at Lake Mission Viejo. He was driving a Chevrolet pickup about 90 mph up a hill on the wrong side of the road when he crashed head-on into a Saturn coupe, killing the driver, Eusebio Flores, 40, and his passenger, Melody Woodbridge, 22.
