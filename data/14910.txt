"Officers saw a vehicle traveling the wrong way on a one-way street. As they went to investigate to initiate a traffic stop the vehicle did come to a stop ... the officer observed what he believed to be narcotics inside the vehicle," said Craig. "As the officer began to recover evidence the suspect then took off at a high rate of speed."

Craig said the officer did fire one shot from his weapon.

"We're not sure if he struck the suspect, although once the officer disengaged from the vehicle, the vehicle still continued at a high rate of speed, overturned striking a light stand. We're not sure what caused the suspect's death," said Craig.

The driver was pronounced dead at the scene of the crash.

The chief said the officer is being treated for injuries at a hospital. Local 4 has learned he suffered just scrapes and bruises.

"Very fortunate, certainly this could have been a tragic outcome for the officer," said Craig.

Craig said the officer's partner did not fire any shots and was not injured.
