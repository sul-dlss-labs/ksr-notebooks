Bismarck police say a suspect in a burglary killed himself in front of officers after hours of cooperating with an investigation.

David Doda, 44, was pronounced dead at St. Alexius Medical Center at 6:11 p.m. Saturday.

Sgt. Mark Buschena said a Bismarck woman who lives in the mobile home court at 2500 Centennial Road called 911 at 1 p.m. Saturday to report a burglary in progress. She was in her car and saw a man prying into her door and entering her home. Officers arrived and a man, identified as Doda, came out of the home. He followed commands and was taken into custody.

Officers interviewed Doda at the police department, and he agreed to show them items in his home he had stolen. A detective and two patrol officers accompanied Doda to his home, also in the court at 2500 Centennial Road, at 4:02 p.m., Buschena said.

The officers searched the recliner Doda sat in and the area surrounding it, Buschena said. However, Doda pulled a firearm out of an unknown place and shot himself in the head at 5:29 p.m., Buschena said. Metro Ambulance transported Doda to St. Alexius, where he was pronounced dead.

Buschena said the investigation into the burglary and others that may be related will continue. The police department also will review policies and procedures to determine if anything could have been done differently in the case. Buschena said it is not unusual for officers to take handcuffs off of a cooperating suspect in such a situation.

The three officers involved all remain on regular duty, Buschena said.
