Mario Vanegas, a 45-year-old man, was shot and killed by police Wednesday, June 22, in the 3800 block of West 27th Street in Jefferson Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Officers responded to a call at 9:30 p.m. about a man with a possible weapon, said Rosario Herrera, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

When police arrived, a teenage girl, later identified as Vanegas' daughter, was yelling from a residence.

Police entered the residence and Vanegas charged at them with a knife, Herrera said. They responded by firing at him.

Vanegas was hit several times and was pronounced dead at the scene.

The officers involved in the shooting have been identified as Officer Cesar Aranda, Officer Brian Schneider, Officer Jose Gonzalez and Officer Leonardo Olea.

The LAPD Force Investigation Division is handling the officer-involved shooting investigation.
