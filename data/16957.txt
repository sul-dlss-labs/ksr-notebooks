SAN ANTONIO â€“ A Texas Department of Public Safety trooper shot and killed a man late Wednesday night in south Bexar County.

The shooting happened around 11:30 p.m. during a traffic stop on Highway 16 South near King's Hill.

Trooper Deon Cockrell, a DPS spokesman, said when the trooper stopped the driver for having a non-working tail light, he told the lawman he was a felon and he was armed.

"The driver resisted and attempted to get back into the vehicle," Cockrell said. The trooper deployed his Taser. The subject attempted to get back into the vehicle. It was at that time, the trooper drew his service weapon."

The trooper, a two-year veteran of the force, shot and killed the man.

Cockrell said Texas Rangers investigators found a loaded long-barrelled weapon in the driver's car.

The northbound lanes of Highway 16 from Poteet to San Antonio were closed for several hours, but reopened around 8:30 a.m.
