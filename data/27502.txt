Original story:

A man shot by a Reno police officer last Wednesday died of his injuries, according to a release from the Sparks Police Department, the agency investigating the incident.

The man was shot on Feb. 5 at about 8 p.m. after officers were called to the area of Centennial Way and Wedekind Road on a report of a man wielding a knife.

The man was uncooperative with officers, according to the release, and moved aggressively towards the officers after he refused to comply with their commands. One officer fired his handgun at the suspect, striking them.

The suspect was then transported to Renown Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.
