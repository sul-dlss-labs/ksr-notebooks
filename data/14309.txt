The officer, who was wearing a protective vest, wasn't seriously wounded and was treated and released, officials said. Police credit the vest for saving the officer's life, KXAS-TV (NBC5) reported.

Police told NBC5 that the officer approached the vehicle and spoke to the driver, who was cooperative. During the stop, police said, the officer asked the woman in the passenger seat to get out of the car.

Police said she got out, pulled a handgun and shot the officer in the chest, NBC5 reported.

The male driver was arrested but later released, police reported. Farmers Branch police declined to name the driver or the officer because the investigation is in progress. The officer, who has been on the force for two years, is on routine paid administrative leave pending internal and district attorney investigations, NBC5 reported.

"It affects everyone. It could've been any one of us at any one time," Officer Kris Garrett, Farmers Branch police spokesman, told the station. "There is no routine traffic stop."
