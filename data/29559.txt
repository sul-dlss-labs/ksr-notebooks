A man and woman were killed after a high-speed chase by a Wichita County deputy resulted in a fiery crash in north Wichita Falls Wednesday morning.

Sheriff David Duke said the deputy attempted to stop a Chrysler 200 near the new county law enforcement center on Central Freeway but the car sped away. The county unit pursued the vehicle into Wichita Falls at speeds reaching 100 mph.

Duke said the driver appeared to be under the influence. He said the chase came north on Scott Avenue, which joins Old Iowa Park Road. The Chrysler left the street, crashed into a brushy area off Iowa Park Road, and burst into flames.

Wichita Falls firefighters arrived on the scene and Wichita Falls Police units blocked off the area.

Duke said the woman killed in the crash was a passenger pinned into the backseat. The male driver suffered critical injuries and burns and was rushed to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Identities have not been released. Duke said the Department of Public Safety is investigating the incident.

Coincidentally, this pursuit began almost exactly where another chase began early Sunday morning that resulted in deputies shooting and killing a driver who attempted to hit them with his vehicle.
