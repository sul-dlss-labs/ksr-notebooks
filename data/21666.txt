INDIAN RIVER COUNTY â€” A deputy-involved shooting about 8 p.m. Wednesday has left one person dead at a home in a subdivision southwest of Vero Beach, according to sheriff's officials.

The unidentified deputy has been placed on paid administrative leave as per department policy, said Lt. Eric Flowers, Sheriff's Office spokesman.

The deputy was responding to a threat of suicide call at a residence in the 600 block of Carriage Lake Way, southwest of Eighth Street and 58th Avenue and near Imagine Schools at South Vero, Flowers said.

The name of the deceased person and circumstances surrounding the death were not released pending an investigation, Flowers said.

The Sheriff's Office is working on obtaining a search warrant for the home, Flowers said,

The State Attorney's Office was on the scene Wednesday night because it was an officer-involved shooting, Flowers said. The State Attorney's Office is conducting a parallel investigation of the incident. A crime scene unit was working overnight at the scene.

Flowers said the Sheriff's Office is following the same procedures with its investigation as it did after a drug raid in March in Gifford that resulted in the death of a 21-year-old woman in the home at the time.
