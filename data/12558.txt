CRAWFORD, Colo. – The Montrose County Sheriff’s Office has identified a man who killed himself after a deputy was shot during a domestic violence call on Tuesday.

The sheriff’s office said Kent Calhoun, 52, of Crawford, was found dead inside a home in the Crawford area near E81 Road and State Highway 92 on Tuesday after a deputy was shot while knocking on the door.

Calhoun died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in the chest, according to preliminary autopsy results released by Montrose County coroner Dr. Thomas Canfield. Calhoun shot himself with a .44-caliber Remington-Magnum revolver, the coroner’s office said.

The deputy, identified Wednesday as Corey Larsen, was shot twice — once in the abdomen and once in the chest — by a large caliber weapon, but was wearing a ballistic vest, the sheriff’s office said. Larsen is in good condition at St. Mary’s Hospital in Grand Junction and is expected to fully recover.

A second deputy, who was with Larsen on the call, was not hit.

A Montrose County sheriff’s deputy was shot twice while responding to a domestic violence call south of Crawford early Monday morning. The man who reportedly fired the shots, Kent Calhoun, 52, was later found dead in his home at 81301 E81 Road, near Gould Reservoir.

Calhoun’s wife called Delta County Dispatch at about 1:30 a.m. Monday to report her husband had thrown her down the stairs and held her there for an hour and a half. She was reportedly bruised but able to get away and call authorities. She notified dispatch Calhoun had access to guns and both had been drinking.
