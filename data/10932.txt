Thirty-one-year-old Charles Gregg Scarbrough of Noble, Oklahoma was shot by a deputy when he pulled out a gun and pointed it at the deputies' direction. Scarbrough died at the scene.



The deputies were originally called to secure the area as investigators looked into some suspected cases of arson in the 20000 block of East Etowah Road in Noble, according to the Sheriff's Office.



Authorities said two deputies are now placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation.
