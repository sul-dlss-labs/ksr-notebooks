MIAMI-DADE COUNTY, Fla. â€“ A 22-year-old man is dead after a police-involved shooting in northwest Miami-Dade County.

It happened before 8 p.m. Wednesday in the 800 block of Northwest 76th Street, Miami-Dade police said.

Officers who happened to be part of a neighborhood resource unit were on bike patrol when there was a call of shots fired near Northwest 75th Street and Northwest Eighth Avenue.

It's unclear if the officers were responding to that call or if they happened to be in the area and were flagged down. But at least one officer arrived at the scene on a bicycle and had a confrontation with the man, identified as Tevin Barkley.

An officer discharged his gun, fatally wounding Barkley.

Police said they found a Cobray M-11 assault-style weapon.

Barkley has been arrested in Miami-Dade County before in 2014 on charges that include trespassing, resisting without violence and carrying a concealed firearm.

No officers were hurt in Wednesday night's shooting, which remains under investigation.
