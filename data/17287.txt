COMMERCE, Ga. — The Georgia Bureau of Investigation has started its investigation in to a deadly officer-involved shooting in Commerce.

According to the police department, officers were called to a home on Ashford Lane around 12:15 a.m. Thursday in reference to an alleged domestic disturbance.

Three officers said they arrived at the home and were met by Brian Noel, who allowed the officers to enter the home to detain his son, Joseph Noel.

The police department said the officers found Joseph Noel hiding in the attic. When they made commands to him, he refused. During the exchange, officers say Joseph Noel held up an object that appeared to be a firearm and charged at the officers.

The officers then fired a Taser and a gun at Joseph Joel, striking him in the leg.

Joseph Noel was transported to Athens Regional Medical Center, where he later died.

The GBI’s independent investigation will determine what occurred during the incident. When the investigation is complete, it will be turned over to the Jackson County District Attorney’s Office for any action it deems appropriate.
