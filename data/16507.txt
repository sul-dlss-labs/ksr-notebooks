(WOIO) - U.S. Marshals say Reginald Marshall, who was featured as the Fugitive of the Week on June 1, was killed in a police-involved shooting after a standoff with Toledo Police on Wednesday.

According to Toledo Police, officers spotted a stolen vehicle in east Toledo and pursued it. After a brief chase, two men fled from the vehicle. One was arrested immediately, but the other barricaded himself inside an abandoned home nearby.

Police and SWAT surrounded the home and a standoff ensued. Toledo Police sent in K-9 Officer Falko. Hours later when police were able to safely enter the home, Falko and Marshall were found dead. U.S. Marshals say 27-year-old Marshall is believed to have killed the K-9.
