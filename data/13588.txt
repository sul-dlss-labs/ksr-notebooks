A "belligerent" woman was shot and killed by police Thursday night after officers said she came at them with a butcher knife while they were responding to a domestic incident.



Angelique Styles, 60, of the 10900 block of South Eberhart Avenue, was pronounced dead just after 8 p.m. at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn, according to the Cook County Medical Examinerâ€™s office.



Fraternal Order of Police spokesman Pat Camden said Styles' brother called 911 when the woman began "tearing the house apart" and picked up a knife.



Officers responding to the home on South Eberhart Avenue found a woman who was "belligerent and acting totally violent," Camden said.

The brother said his sister may have been under the influence of nacotics, according to a police statement.



Officers tried to calm the woman and demanded she drop the butcher knife several times, but she instead raised it and lunged at officers, Camden said.



Styles was critically wounded when police shot her and she was transported to the hospital where she later died.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting, a spokesman said.

The shooting took place just blocks from where Chicago police shot and killed a man who lunged at them with two knives.
