Casa Grande Police say a suspect was shot and killed after he assaulted an officer during a domestic disturbance call overnight.

According to police, officers were dispatched to a home near Peart and McCartney roads around 10 p.m. Thursday. A 27-year-old Casa Grande man, identified as Cameron Hall, confronted and assaulted an officer at the scene.

The officer tried to defend himself by using a Taser on Hall, but it was ineffective. Police say Hall repeatedly struck the officer and the officer ended up firing his service weapon, hitting the suspect.

First aid was immediately provided until emergency crews arrived. Hall was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The officer, Stephen Knauber, a 10-year veteran with the department, was not significantly injured during the incident. He has been placed on administrative duty per normal policy.

The Arizona Department of Public Safety is handling the investigation.
