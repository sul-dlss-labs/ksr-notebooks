Authorities have identified the man killed by a law enforcement officer Wednesday in St. James, Minn., as Gilberto Salas, 20, of Gaylord.

The Ramsey County medical examiner’s office identified him Thursday. An autopsy determined that he died of multiple gunshot wounds.

According to the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which is investigating the matter, the incident began unfolding late Wednesday morning when Nicollet County sheriff’s deputies spotted a vehicle in Lafayette that had been reported stolen in New Ulm.

A pursuit ensued involving six law enforcement agencies. Eventually the male driver was identified and the pursuit terminated for safety reasons.

A half-hour later, the vehicle was spotted in St. James. Officers followed the vehicle until the driver got stuck in a snowbank. He then fled into a Casey’s General Store in the 600 block of Second Avenue South, where he hid alone in an office. Officers from the St. James Police Department, Watonwan County sheriff’s office and Minnesota State Patrol entered the convenience store.

Officers deployed multiple stun gun rounds before one officer discharged a firearm, striking Salas. He was pronounced dead at the St. James hospital. One of the officers was injured and treated and released from the hospital.

The BCA said a knife was recovered at the scene. The agency also said there was no video footage of the shooting from either officer body cameras or squad car dashboard cameras.

The officer who shot the suspect is on standard administrative leave. The BCA said it would identify the officers as the investigation continues.
