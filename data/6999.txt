A man who died after Chicago police used a Taser to subdue him was combative during an arrest and may have been "on drugs," authorities said Wednesday.

Roberto Gonzalez, 37, was resisting arrest about 7:30 p.m. and became violent before Chicago police used a Taser and chemical spray to try to subdue him in the 2600 block of South Trumbull Avenue, Chicago police said.

An autopsy was performed Wednesday, but the results were pending toxicology studies, a Cook County Medical Examiner spokesman said. The office identified Gonzalez as a 24-year-old, but police and family said he was 37.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the department's use of the Taser, said Ilana Rosenzweig, chief of the agency that reviews police conduct. The investigation will include interviews with witnesses and evidence gathered from the man's autopsy.

Investigators also will review videotape from the incident. The Taser used was a newer version bought by police and included a camera attachment, said Monique Bond, a spokeswoman for Chicago police. That camera is activated whenever the gun is turned on, according to the weapon's makers.

Gonzalez was a known gang member, according to a police source. He also has a criminal history dating back a decade.
