Police say an Arkansas woman who was a passenger in a vehicle trying to flee authorities died when the chase ended in a crash Thursday.

Brandy M. Neal, 30, of Cabot was riding inside a 1997 Chevrolet that was “attempting to evade law enforcement” in White County, a report states.

Around 3:45 p.m., the Chevrolet crossed Arkansas 13 at Oak Dale Church Road and went airborne, causing it to strike a telephone pole and roll several times, authorities said.

Neal was fatally hurt. No other injuries were reported.

Police did not name the driver of the vehicle, and additional circumstances of the crash were not immediately clear.

Travel conditions at the time were described as clear and dry.

Neal’s death was one of at least 425 reported this year on an Arkansas road, according to preliminary figures.
