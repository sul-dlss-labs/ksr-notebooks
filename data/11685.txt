A Chicago police officer shot and killed a 20-year-old gunman who opened fire on two other people this morning in the South Side's West Englewood neighborhood, authorities said.

No officers were hurt and one person was being questioned by authorities in the shooting that happened about 11:40 a.m. near 63rd Street and Honore Street.

The Cook County medical examiner's office identified the dead man as Divonte Young, of the 6400 block of South Wood Street, a little more than one block from where he was shot.

According to preliminary information from law enforcement sources, a narcotics unit officer on surveillance in the area saw the gunman open fire on at least two other people in front of a grocery store near a vacant lot.

The officer responded to the shooting, announced his office and told the gunman to drop his weapon, police said in a preliminary statement.

The gunman kept firing and ran to a vacant lot where he fired again, prompting the officer to shoot and kill the gunman, said Pat Camden, a spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police.

No one else was hurt, and the gunman's identity has yet to be released.

Police were questioning a companion of the gunman who also might have played a role in the shooting, but no charges have been filed as of Thursday afternoon.

The Independent Police Review Authority, which probes all shootings involving Chicago police, is investigating the incident. It's the second police-involved shooting in the city in as many days.
