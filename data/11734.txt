BRIGHTON, Alabama -- The Jefferson County Coroner's Office this afternoon identified the man shot to death today by Hueytown police as Calvin Lee Robinson, Jr., 21, of Brighton.

Robinson was pronounced dead on the scene.

The shooting happened about 12:30 p.m. near the intersection of Hardy Street and Parker Springs Street in Brighton, about 20 yards away from the Bessemer Super Highway.

Another person was injured in the shooting, which involved two narcotics officers. Neither of the officers were injured.

Bill Veitch, Chief Deputy District Attorney for the Bessemer Cutoff, confirmed that Robinson was a passenger in a vehicle and that the injured man was the driver. The injured man was shot in the leg and is expected to live. A handgun was found in the car, but Veitch said he did not know which man it belonged to.

A Hueytown officer involved in the incident took off his shirt after the shooting and used it as a tourniquet to treat the injured man. "The officers did a good job. They did everything he could to get him to the hospital. There was nothing they could do for the man who was killed," Veitch said.
