THE FAMILY OF a 12-year-old girl fatally struck by a car driven by an off-duty cop demanded a full investigation yesterday as it expressed doubts about police accounts. "We all want justice," said Charlene Richardson, 34, the sister of Virginia Verdee, who was killed Friday night outside her Bronx church by Officer Michael Carlo's Jeep. Carlo, 37, a narcotics cop, has not been charged. Meanwhile, police denied initial reports Carlo was rushing his pregnant wife to the hospital when he ran over Virginia in front of the Love Gospel Assembly Church. Cops said Virginia was hit when as she crossed the Grand Concourse 30 to 50 feet north of the intersection at E. 183rd St. The veteran cop stopped after hitting the girl, and a Breathalyzer test detected no alcohol in his system, police said. But Richardson charged "it's just another case of officers covering officers.

" The family gathered yesterday at the Love Gospel Assembly Church with lawyer Sanford Rubenstein, who demanded the Bronx district attorney launch an investigation. "When I asked his [Carlo's] name, they wouldn't even tell me," said Virginia's mother, Gloria Richardson, who met with police brass Saturday. A spokesman for Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said there are no immediate plans for an investigation. Gloria Richardson said cops wrote her daughter, Latoya Richardson, 23, a summons for interfering with the investigation. She said cops used pepper spray on her daughter and tackled her when she took pictures. "She did nothing wrong," Gloria Richardson said. "I don't even understand why they would do that. My daughter was killed and they throw on the ground my other daughter.
