The family of a man killed in a Dallas police shooting last month called Friday for the suspension without pay of the officer involved, as the investigation continues into what they say was the murder of an unarmed man.

Officer Clark Staller fatally shot 25-year-old Clinton Roebexar Allen during a confrontation March 10. Dallas police have said Allen, who had PCP and marijuana in his system at the time, grabbed the officer’s collar and choked him before the shooting.

“My son, my only son, Clinton Allen, was murdered by Dallas policeman Clark Staller,” Collette Flanagan said in a news conference at an Oak Cliff office building.

Allen’s family has said from the beginning that they do not believe the officer’s account of the domestic disturbance call in the 3300 block of Southern Oaks Boulevard, near East Illinois Avenue.

Staller’s attorney, Zach Horn, declined to comment Friday on the case and referred to an earlier statement.

“Officer Staller was being choked and feared for his life,” he said in that statement last month. “We have no doubt that the investigation of this officer-involved shooting will conclude that his actions were justified.”

Staller has been on the force almost five years. He remains on regular duty.

Flanagan said her son, who was shot seven times, was, “executed like a rabid animal.”

The family also said Staller, 30, has credibility problems because of a disciplinary history that includes a 20-day suspension last year. That suspension was for being untruthful to a supervisor and entering inaccurate information on a police report, among other things.

“The credibility of this officer is suspect,” said the Rev. Ron Wright, a Dallas activist who organized the news conference and is a frequent critic of Dallas police shootings of black men.

Wright acknowledged that there was marijuana and PCP found in Allen’s system after his death, but he said the levels of the drugs suggested Allen took them days earlier.

“Clinton was stolen from us,” Flanagan said. Among other family members present Friday were Allen’s 1-year-old twin sons.

Flanagan repeatedly asked for people to call Dallas Police Chief David Brown’s office to request that the officer be suspended.

Brown declined to be interviewed. But the department released a statement Friday evening that said Allen was attacking Staller when the shooting occurred. The officer had tried to use his Taser on Allen but it had no effect, police said.

“Suspect Allen began physically fighting with Officer Staller and they both flipped over a walkway railing,” the statements said. “Suspect Allen gained a position behind Officer Staller and began choking him, lifting Staller off of his feet.”

Police said Staller could not breathe. While being choked from behind, Staller drew his gun and fired, police said.

The statement also noted that Allen’s criminal record includes multiple convictions for assault and drug possession.

The Dallas police investigation is ongoing.

At the Friday news conference were fliers, titled “unarmed man murdered,” that included photos of Allen and Staller, as well as Staller’s badge number. Family members said they plan to post the fliers in churches and businesses.

The Dallas County medical examiner’s office did not release the autopsy report in the case in response to a request Friday. A copy obtained and provided by Wright says one of the seven bullet wounds was to Allen’s back. The other six were to his chest, abdomen and left upper arm, according to the report.

Wright provided copies of signed affidavits from four people who said they witnessed a portion of the encounter. None said they saw the shooting itself.

The affidavits have been sent to the Dallas police internal affairs division, Wright said.
