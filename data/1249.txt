OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- A dispute with a neighbor over trash

cans may have led to the fatal shooting by Oklahoma City

police of a mentally disabled World War II veteran Friday

morning.

Lloyd Rayburn, 83, was killed in the back yard of his

south-side home just before 9:30 a.m., police said. Rayburn

had suffered a brain injury in the war and lived on a

medical disability pension.

"The neighbors were putting their trash cans where he

didn't want them," said Connie Geissler, Rayburn's

granddaughter. "He was pretty fussy about that. It wasn't

their fault."

Rayburn approached his neighbor and pulled out a

handgun, Geissler said. Rayburn also threatened to kill his

own wife and a son, who called 911 and requested that

police help him get the weapon from his father so that he

could take him to the Veterans Affairs Hospital. Three

officers responding to the call found Rayburn in the back

yard, said Capt. Jessica Cummins, a police spokeswoman.

"The police came, and they asked what he was doing. My

grandpa didn't understand, because he . . . he's sick, you

know," Geissler said.

Cummins said the officers tried to talk him into

surrendering the weapon and had his son plead with him to

drop the gun, but "none of that worked."

When Rayburn drew the gun from his pocket and aimed it

at one of the officers, Sgt. Robert Dunagan Jr., 41, opened

fire, Cummins said. Dunagan "felt his life was in imminent

danger."

Rayburn was dead at the scene.

Dunagan is on routine administrative leave with pay

pending an investigation by homicide detectives and the

police Office of Professional Standards.

Geissler questioned Dunagan's decision. "It just seems

like there could've been a better way to handle an

80-year-old man," she said.
