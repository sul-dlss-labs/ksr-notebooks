UPDATED at 3:00 p.m. with information about the death of the barricaded man.

A more than five-hour police standoff at a south St. Louis County home Monday afternoon ended with a barricaded man shooting and killing himself.

Police say a woman in the home in the 4600 block of Mattis Road in the Concord area called police about 7:30 a.m. to say her separated husband had arrived at the residence, despite a restraining order she has against him.

After the man realized police had been called, he barricaded himself in the home's garage, and officers believed he was armed with a handgun, said St. Louis County Police spokesman Officer Benjamin Granda.

A county tactical operations unit attempted to make contact with the man, but heard a gunshot around 1 p.m., Granda said.

Members of the unit then entered the garage where they found the man with a fatal self-inflicted gunshot wound, police said.

Just since Aug. 17, county police report that officers responded to five calls for service at the home related to domestic assaults and disturbances. Officers were also sent on extra patrols in the area, Granda said.

Granda said that officers tried to contact the man through a loudspeaker and cellphone before the gunshot.

“Our crisis communications team is skilled at de-escalating a situation,” Granda said. “Unfortunately that didn’t happen this time.”
