State Police Trooper Kevin Caldwell of the Jackson post was coming home from seminary last week when he happened upon the scene of a tense shoot-out and was able to help a wounded police officer.

"I believe it is the grace of God that put me in that situation," said Caldwell, who was off duty and armed at the time and felt bound by his conscience to stop. "To call it coincidence, I am not a huge fan of coincidence. I am a fan of God's providence."Caldwell said he arrived at an Allen Park home Friday about the same time as an Allen Park officer, who was shot by a man who refused to be served an eviction notice.

What followed was an hours-long standoff, during which dozens of shots were fired before the man was found dead of a gunshot wound, authorities said. The Allen Park officer survived.

Caldwell said he could not elaborate on what he saw or did because the investigation is ongoing.

He was leaving Detroit Baptist Theological Seminary in Allen Park, where he is working on his theology and divinity degree. The school is about six blocks from the shooting site.
