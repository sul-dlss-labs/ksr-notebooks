According to Miami Shores police, the victim is a woman in her 40s who has a history of mental illness.

Police said the firearm she was holding was a black pellet pistol. She pointed it in the direction of responding officers, according to Miami Shores police.

“The weapon was pointed toward the officer. The officer felt for his safety and fired at the victim,” said Miami Shores Police Chief Kevin Lystad. “I know there was some dialogue as far as the weapon and dropping the weapon.”

Miami-Dade police officers were also at the scene assisting Miami Shores police.

Family members identified the woman as 48-year-old Etianna Planellas. They told Local 10 News Planellas was intoxicated when she came outside, and that she was shot in front of her elderly mother.
