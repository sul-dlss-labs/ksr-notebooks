The man shot and killed by a Woodland police officer early Sunday morning has been identified as Gene Marshall.

Marshall’s wife called 911 at about 1:50 a.m. to report that her husband had a gun and had threatened her and threatened to kill himself, according to the Woodland Police Department.

Officer Terry Casey arrived at the Woodland home, 727 Third St., about five minutes later, police said. Marshall, 58, approached Casey with a handgun and Casey fired his weapon, striking and killing Marshall, police said.

Casey, a 13 year veteran of the Woodland Police Department, has been placed on paid administrative leave while the Clark County Sheriff’s Office investigates the shooting.

“The Woodland Police Department is deeply saddened by this tragic loss of life and the resultant grief caused to Mr. Marshall’s family,” the agency said in a press release Monday.
