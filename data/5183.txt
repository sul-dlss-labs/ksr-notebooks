One murder suspect is dead and another is in police custody after a shootout in North Charlotte. Late Friday night, police tracked two murder suspects to a room at a Super 8 Motel on Sunset Drive. Police attempted to serve arrest warrants for Eric Randall Armstrong (L) and Michael Anthony Hall (R). Both men were wanted for the murder of Joseph Daniel Coley. (See previous post)

The two suspects opened fire at police as they attempted to enter the room and officers returned fire. Eric Armstrong was killed. The other suspect, Michael Anthony Hall, surrendered and was taken into custody. None of the officers at the scene were injured.



Yesterday, police also arrested 17 year old Raheem Pate (L) as an accessory in the murder of Joseph Coley. Pate and Hall are both in the Mecklenburg County Jail.

The murder victim, Joseph Coley, was pumping gas Thursday evening at a Samâ€™s Mart on Sugar Creek Road. The men shot Coley several times and then left the scene. Police are still trying to figure out a motive for the double shooting.
