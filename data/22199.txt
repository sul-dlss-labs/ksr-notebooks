A Paulsboro man died while in police custody Saturday night, after being arrested and placed in the back of a Haddon Township patrol car, according to the Camden County Prosecutor's Office.

The Prosecutor's Office, along with Haddon Township Police Chief Mark Cavallo, said they are investigating Shron Norman's death. An autopsy performed Sunday revealed no evidence of trauma to Norman’s body, they said.

Authorities said Norman, 37, passed out in the back of a Haddon Township police car Saturday night and died despite efforts to perform CPR on him. He was pronounced dead at Our Lady of Lourdes Medical Center in Camden.

Norman was taken into custody Saturday around 1:30 a.m. after staff at Crown Fried Chicken on Mount Ephraim Avenue called 911. Police said the staff reported that Norman was threatening customers and damaging property in the store.

Authorities said two Haddon Township Police officers responded to the call and struggled with Norman while taking him into custody. One officer sustained "superficial injuries" according to the Prosecutor's Office.

The Prosecutor's Office said it will be conducting interviews to get a "detailed account of the interaction between police and Norman."

The medical examiner is awaiting the results of toxicology tests before determining a cause of death, authorities said.

Anyone who witnessed this event is asked to contact Camden County Prosecutor’s Office Investigator Lance Saunders at (856) 225-8513.
