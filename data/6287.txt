Chicago police shot and killed a 29-year-old man from Riverdale on Thursday night in an exchange of gunfire.

Hubert Burgs died of multiple gunshot wounds, according to the Cook County medical examiner's office.

Gang officers made a traffic stop at 114th Street and Stewart Avenue, and an officer noticed two people drinking in a minivan, said Pat Camden, Chicago Police Department spokesman.

Burgs was in the driver's seat of the minivan, Camden said. The officers ordered the two out of the car, and Burgs got out and ran down a gangway, Camden said.

The plainclothes officers identified themselves as police officers, Camden said.

"An officer chased him on foot, he jumped over a fence, the offender fired a shot, got to the rear fence of the yard, was getting ready to climb over the fence, turned and pointed to the officer a second time," he said. "The officer fired two shots, fatally wounding the offender."

Burgs was dead on arrival at the scene, and his weapon, a 40-caliber handgun, was recovered, Camden said. No police officers were hurt, he said.

Burgs had a Riverdale address, Camden said, but he couldn't give the exact address. The Cook County medical examiner's office also listed a Riverdale address for him, but said his mother lives at that address.

The other individual who was in the minivan was questioned but not arrested, Camden said.

The Office of Professional Standards and the police department are investigating the shooting, he said.
