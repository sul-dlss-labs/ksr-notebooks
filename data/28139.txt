The victim in the crash has been identified as Casey Vincent, 19, of Fulton, N.Y. While police were not chasing Vincent at the time of the crash, speed does appear to be a factor. The investigation continues.

OSWEGO COUNTY, N.Y. (WSYR-TV) — A man was killed in Oswego County after his car crashed and caught fire right in front of Battle Island Park on State Route 48.

Just north of the City of Fulton, Oswego County Sheriff’s Deputies said that same vehicle took off and lead Fulton Police on a chase in the city. They called off the chase when speeds became dangerous while still in city limits.

Minutes later, a Sheriff’s deputy discovered the fiery crash scene and the driver, who was out of the vehicle after he had hit multiple objects with his vehicle.

State Route 48 was closed between County Route 8 and 85.
