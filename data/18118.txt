State police said the man tried to stop a car and the truck after he ran onto I-57.

The car drove around the man, but the man jumped onto the truck and told the driver he had been robbed, according to state police.

According to state police, the truck driver pulled to the shoulder and told the man to get off of the truck. The fleeing man tried to jump back onto the truck, fell and was caught underneath the rear axle, state police said.

The medical examiner's office listed Johnson's address as being in the 12000 block of South Bishop Street in Chicago, but police records gave an address in the 6400 block of South Cottage Grove Avenue.

An autopsy was scheduled for Thursday.
