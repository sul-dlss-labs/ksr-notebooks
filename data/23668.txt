SOUTHWEST MIAMI-DADE, FLA. (WSVN) - A man who had barricaded himself inside a Southwest Maimi-Dade house Monday morning shot and killed himself after a police standoff, according to officials.

According to Miami-Dade Police, 45-year-old Alfred Alvarez barricaded himself in a home near Southwest 209th Street and 133rd Avenue.

After a police standoff that began at 6 a.m., Alvarez shot himself.

Police set up a perimeter in the area after a domestic abuse call was made. Officials who arrived on the scene heard what they believe were gunshots.

Two women and a boy ran out of the home and were taken to safety by a special response team. Police were then told by the woman and boy that Alvarez and a 12-year-old girl were left inside the house.

“Our concern was for the female juvenile who was still in the residence,” said Miami-Dade detective Lee Cowart. “She was actually hid under a bed in her bedroom on the second floor, so that was our primary concern: getting her out safely. Our SRT was able to remove the female juvenile from the second-floor bedroom window. She was safely reunited with her family members.”

Alvarez was pronounced dead inside the home.

A heavy police presence remains in the area, and residents are advised to avoid the scene.

The cause of the shooting remains under investigation.
