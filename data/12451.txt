NORTH HUDSON — A state trooper shot and killed a man who led police on a car chase in the Adirondacks and then ran into the woods and tried to grab the sidearm of one of his pursuers.

Richard J. Aubin, 28, of Au Sable Forks was pronounced dead at the scene of the shooting in a wooded area about 100 miles north of Albany at about 5:30 p.m. Tuesday. Troopers began pursuing Aubin less than 30 minutes earlier after they clocked his pickup going 95 mph south on I-87.

Aubin did not pull over. He abandoned his truck on Route 9 after spike strips shredded his tires. The two troopers followed Aubin as he fled into the woods.

State Police Capt. Robert LaFountain said troopers could not subdue Aubin with pepper spray. He grabbed at one trooper’s sidearm during an assault and the other trooper fired several rounds.

LaFountain said Aubin was “violently resisting arrest” and the troopers’ response appears to have been appropriate.

“His behavior was irrational, however he does have a criminal history that’s rather extensive,” LaFountain said.

Aubin began a prison term in 2008 on charges of assault, criminal possession of stolen property and driving without a license, according to state corrections records.

The troopers were treated and released for injuries at a local hospital.

The investigation was continuing Wednesday.
