CAMDEN -- A man who died during a drug arrest here in April choked on a bag of drugs.

The autopsy results for 32-year-old Jorge Rivera support what police have said since the Pemberton man died during an arrest in Camden in April. They said he put a bag of drugs in his mouth when police arrived -- and that's what killed him.The results contradict the account from some witnesses who said that police kicked and punched Rivera and caused him to hit his head on a concrete step.

Rivera's cousin Aster Diaz said she doubts the accuracy of the autopsy results.
