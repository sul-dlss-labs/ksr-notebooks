A gunman who allegedly shot his wife was found dead in his apartment after sheriff’s deputies fired at him, authorities said.

It was unclear whether the man, identified as Eric Smith, 34, was fatally shot by the deputies or committed suicide following a standoff that began late Thursday, said Deputy Colin Matsumoto of the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department. The man was shot at least once, said Brian Elias, a coroner’s investigator.

Deputies responded to his apartment in East Rancho Dominguez, an unincorporated area near Compton, after receiving reports of gunshots.
