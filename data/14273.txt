PORTLAND, Maine â€” A Massachusetts man with prior assault and drug convictions has been sentenced to 15 years in prison after being convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm.

Prosecutors say 28-year-old Jermaine Whindleton of Worcester, Massachusetts, was also sentenced Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Portland to five years of probation.

Whindleton was convicted on April.

Prosecutors say in June 2012 Whindleton used the butt end of a 16-gauge, pump-action shotgun in Porter, Maine to assault a drug associate by striking him on the back of his head during an argument over a drug debt.

As a result of prior convictions in Massachusetts and New York, Whindleton was subject to an enhanced sentence as an armed career criminal requiring a mandatory minimum of 15 years in prison.
