BRODHEAD, Ky. (AP) — Kentucky State Police say officers have fatally shot a man after he refused several commands to drop a gun and then fired a round at officers.

Police say state officers and a sheriff’s deputy responded Thursday evening to a report of a domestic dispute in the Brodhead community of Rockcastle County. When officers arrived, they say, they found 61-year-old Lawrence R. Price armed. Police said Price refused multiple verbal commands to relinquish the weapon and then fired it in the direction of officers, who returned fire.

Price was pronounced dead by the coroner’s office. No one else was injured.

Police say they are continuing to investigate.
