Quiros and the other motorcyclist were speeding on the southbound PIP when Officer Martin Clancy tried to stop the pair in the Alpine section, Grewal said.

The chase "continued for several miles," with Clancy "losing site of the motorcycle at various points in the pursuit," PIP Police Chief Michael Coppola said.

Officer Kevin Condus assisted as Clancy neared Exit 1 in Englewood Cliffs, the chief said.

As they continued south toward the George Washington Bridge, the officers found the debris filed and Quiros's body at the Fletcher Avenue off-ramp, said Grewal, whose Fatal Accident Investigations Unit handled the investigation.

The unit was assisted by members of the Bergen County Sheriff’s Bureau of Criminal Identification, who collected evidence.
