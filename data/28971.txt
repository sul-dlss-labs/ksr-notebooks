MUHLENBERG CO., Ky (WFIE) - Kentucky State Police are investigating an officer-involved shooting that left one person dead Friday.

The Greenville Police Department contacted KSP in reference to a barricaded person just after 6:10 p.m.

Tuesday, Troopers identified that person as 53-year-old Darren W. Randolph.

According to authorities, preliminary investigation shows GPD went into a house in the 400 block of James Street to serve a mental health warrant. That’s when officials say he shot at officers before barricading himself in his basement.

We are told the KSP Special Response Team was requested and negotiations began.

Troopers say those negotiations went on for about two hours.

KSP says Randolph came out of his house with a rifle in what they say was a threatening manner at 2:10 a.m. on Saturday. According to officials, a trooper responded by firing his weapon.

The Muhlenberg County Coroner pronounced Randolph dead at the scene.

We are told no officers were injured.

Neighbors say they had not seen the man in weeks and figured something was off.

“We haven’t seen him for a couple of weeks. We were kind of getting concerned," one neighbor said. “He was texting a lot of strange things. Social media was really strange. We had no idea what he was getting ready to do until he done it.”

Troopers say there is no further information at this time
