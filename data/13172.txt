CHICAGO â€” Police shot and killed a man stabbing his estranged wife in Gage Park Sunday night, authorities said.

Officers responded to a domestic-related call in the 5200 block of South Mozart Street about 9:55 p.m., according to a statement from Chicago police.

A woman standing in front of a home told police that she had an order of protection against her estranged husband, who had been armed with a knife and following her around in a car, according to the statement.

The woman told officers she had seen him earlier at the Kmart near 51st and Kedzie Avenue with a large butcher knife tucked in the back of his pants, said Pat Camden, spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police union.

He followed her home, but she thought he was gone from the area by the time police arrived, Camden said.

Officers asked her to get a copy of the order of protection, according to the police statement. Soon after, they heard a scream and ran to the gangway of the home, where they saw the woman on the ground and a man stabbing her with a knife, police said.

The man then "turned and lunged" toward the officers with the knife in hand and an officer fired, fatally striking him, according to police.

The man was identified as 39-year-old Guadalupe Aguilar of the same block as the shooting, according to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office. He was pronounced dead at 11:49 p.m.

The woman was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital with multiple stab wounds, Camden said. Her injuries were not life threatening, and no officers were injured, according to the police statement.

"This is just Chicago Police Department at its best," Camden said, calling the officers' actions "a classic example of serving and protecting."

"They saved the woman's life," Camden said.

The Independent Police Review Authority is investigating the shooting.
