GRETNA, La. – A police officer shot and killed a suspected drug dealer after the suspect rammed his vehicle into several police cars and then accelerated toward one of the officers, Gretna Police said Thursday.

The incident occurred around 1 p.m. on the West Bank Expressway near the lower level bus terminal close to Milton Street.

Police said the Westbank Major Crime Task Force tried to arrest Corey DiGiovanni, 36, at his home on Anson Street when he took off in a gold pickup truck. Police said they chased him for about two miles, before cornering him near Milton and the Westbank Expressway.





“They were chasing him from the other side of the expressway, through the bus terminal and when they came across the bus terminal, a cop came down this street another came the other way and they tried to box him in,” said Amber Douglas, who witnessed the incident. “That’s when he kept going and they unloaded fire on him.”

Deputy Police Chief Anthony Christiana said the suspect’s car started ramming police cars in an attempted escape and then came forward in the path of an officer. “The officer opened fire, firing several shots and striking the driver of the vehicle.”

“We also believe this particular individual and some of the product that he was distributing may be related to some possible deaths that have been linked to heroin, lately.” A news release from Gretna Police Department said drugs found in DiGiovanni's truck were consistent with heroin, marijuana and numerous pills.

Police said they found drugs, including heroin, in the vehicle. A passenger in the suspect’s truck was arrested at the scene and was not injured. Police said they are questioning the passenger in the ongoing investigation.
