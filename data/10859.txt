Officials say body of suspect in 2011 car chase found in Council Bluffs

Nearly two years after a high-speed chase along the Iowa/Nebraska border, the body of the man authorities say was involved has been found.

According to police, 21-year-old Chance Fletcher of Omaha was driving a stolen car on December 15, 2011, when a Carter Lake cop tried to pull him over. Fletcher sped away, wrecked the car he was in near the Interstate-480 bridge in Council Bluffs and took off on foot. Police searched the area that evening, but he wasn’t found.

The Omaha Police Department’s Missing Person’s Unit and Council Bluffs Police went back to the area on October 11 conducted a ground search and found skeletal remains in a drainage ditch near the bridge where the car chase had ended. A cross-check of dental records has confirmed the body is Fletcher’s.

At the time of the 2011 car chase Fletcher was facing theft and drug charges after an arrest in Bellevue, Nebraska.
