A homeless man was shot and killed after a confrontation with Huntington Park Police Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

About 2 p.m. police responded to the 2400 block of East 57th Street after receiving a call about a homeless man refusing to leave the area while a work crew was attempting to clear the railroad tracks.

Responding officers found the man, who had “armed himself with rocks,” the Sheriff’s Department said in a news release.

The officers used a stun gun to try and subdue the man, but while an officer try to handcuff him, the man picked up a five-foot lead pipe. A second officer then fired his weapon and shot the man. Sheriff’s officials said the second officer had feared for his partner’s life when he shot his gun.

The man was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead, officials said. He has not been identified, but officials said he was between 35 and 40 years old.

The Sheriff’s Department will be assisting Huntington Park Police in their investigation, which is standard in officer-involved shootings.
