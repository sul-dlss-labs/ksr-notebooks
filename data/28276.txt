The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation is investigating after an officer-involved shooting in Jay.

Officials said this happened around 1:18 a.m. Friday and 25-year-old Henry Barnes Jr. was shot and killed.

Officials said someone called 911 about a man threatening people, and officers said they had been looking for the suspect for months.

OSBI said that when Jay Police responded to the call, the suspect ran into the woods. Officers stayed to speak with witnesses, and told them to call if the suspect returned.

The officers said they received another call 10 minutes later and returned to the scene. The suspect came out from the woods with a tire iron and entered a trailer. The officer said he then followed the suspect into the trailer, and tased the suspect but it had no effect. The officer said the suspect raised the tire iron and said he was going to kill the officer, who then fired one shot and killed the suspect.

OSBI stated that police “had several encounters” with the suspect; and said the suspect assaulted a family member who tried to help the person who made the first 911 call.

An officer then shot Barnes Jr. during an altercation.
