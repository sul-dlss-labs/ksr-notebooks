A Cumberland County man has died at the University of Kentucky Medical Center after being shot by authorities following a pursuit in Burkesville.

The Fayette County Coroner's Office says Charles Whitley, 40, died from a gunshot wound Thursday morning, two days after the shooting.

Kentucky State Police say the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office responded Tuesday morning to a report of a suspicious vehicle, but the car wouldn't pull over. Burkesville police and Kentucky State Police joined in the chase, which ended when the suspect crashed into the deputy's vehicle.

An officer's weapon was fired during the pursuit, but authorities haven't identified exactly when the shot was fired or which department the officer was with.

A female passenger wasn't injured and was arrested on outstanding warrants.

No officers were injured.
