A tribal police officer fatally shot a man on the Rosebud Sioux Indian Reservation on Wednesday, according to the FBI.

A man with a weapon confronted the officer in Parmelee just before midnight Wednesday, and the officer fired when the man "failed to respond to commands," the FBI said in a tweet Thursday afternoon. The man later died from his wounds.
