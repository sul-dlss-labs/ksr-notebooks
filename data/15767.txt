Oklahoma City police said they shot and killed a man who attempted to hit two officers with his vehicle following a pursuit early Wednesday morning.

According to police, just after midnight, officers attempted to pull over a vehicle for a traffic violation near N.W. 22nd and Villa. But the driver refused to stop. That's when the pursuit began.

During the pursuit, police said a passenger jumped out of the car at N.W. 23rd and Villa, and attempted to run from officers. But he was caught. That passenger has not been identified.

The vehicle pursuit continued along several streets before the suspect, later identified as 37-year-old Glenn C. Lewis, drove to a dead-end on N.W. 27th near N. Youngs Boulevard.

Officers then began to approach the vehicle. However, police said when Lewis reached the end of the street, he turned the vehicle around towards the officers' direction, and accelerated towards the officers who were outside their cars.

According to police, the two officers, Sgt. Keith Sweeney and Ofc. Steven Cholity, were in the suspect vehicle's path. They opened fire on the car.

The car continued east on N.W. 27th for another block until it hit a parked car. That's when the officers approached the vehicle and saw that Lewis had been shot several times. Lewis was later pronounced dead on the scene.

Both officers will be placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation of the shooting. Sgt. Keith Sweeney is a 7-year veteran with the Oklahoma City Police Department, and Officer Steven Cholity has been on the force for three years.

Lewis is a long-time felon with a Department of Corrections record. He also has a felony warrant for drugs.

Police are still investigating and expect a crime scene to be up in the area for most of the morning.
