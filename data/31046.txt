Oct. 3, 2021 — On Saturday, Oct. 2, just prior to 8:30 p.m., the Lane County Sheriff’s Office received the report of a domestic dispute at a residence involving a firearm in the 87000 block of Rice Road in Mapleton.

The caller stated that 28-year-old Jazmine Thein used a firearm to shoot at her brother. Her brother was able to flee to a neighbor’s house.

LCSO deputies arrived and were able to confirm that Thein was still inside the residence.

Over the course of the next several hours, deputies worked to negotiate and de-escalate the situation so that she could be taken into custody safely.

Shortly after 6 a.m., however, deputies found her deceased in a bedroom from what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot.

No shots were ever fired by deputies during this incident.

The incident is LCSO Case #21-5606.

According to LCSO Public Information Officer Sargent Tom Speldrich, the Lane County Medical Examiner’s Office is conducting the post mortem.
