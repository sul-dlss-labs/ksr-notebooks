Winston-Salem police said they believe a man took his own life Monday afternoon after threatening officers and firing a gun toward officers in a south Winston-Salem subdivision near Peters Creek Parkway.Just before noon, police went to a home for a welfare check on Parkview Court regarding 55-year-old Kevin Simmons, who was suspected of having consumed a large amount of drugs.Police said that when the officers arrived at the home, they encountered Simmons, who they say threatened them with a handgun and discharged pepper spray inside of the home. As police were working to help a woman inside the home escape safely and establish a perimeter, police said a gun was discharged from inside the home and the bullet came through a window and into the vicinity of two officers. Those officers are Winston-Salem Police Sergeant C.B. Giles and Winston-Salem Police Officer D.E. Brandon. They were not hurt and no residents were hurt either. Right now, it's unclear how the woman who was safely removed from the home is connected to Simmons.Dozens of police flooded the scene and barred residents of the community from entering for several hours. Throughout the ordeal, negotiators were able to communicate with Simmons inside. Police said he continued to make threatening statements toward officers as they tried to convince him to come outside. However, they say Simmons remained uncooperative and threatening during those negotiations.During the conversation, police said they heard another gunshot from inside the home.Police preliminary determined that Simmons died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.No officers were injured in the incident. The neighborhood opened back up to residents at around 5 p.m. Several residents who were home when the incident happened were instructed by police to remain inside, lock their doors and close their windows.Heidi Park, a neighbor of Simmons, says she was surprised to learn that Simmons is the suspect in this incident."He was the first one on the street to offer the kids to fix their bikes. When our freezer broke down they were the first ones to help us and say, ‘Hey, you can put your food in our freezer.’ So to me, this was not like him,” said Park."This is not typical so it’s just been a hard, long day. We’re really praying for them and we’re really hurting for them because we know them. They’re our friends and we care about them."It’s a tough situation for all of us. We’re all hurting and it’s been a long day but we’re here for each other as a neighborhood."This is a developing story. Stay with WXII 12 News for more details.
