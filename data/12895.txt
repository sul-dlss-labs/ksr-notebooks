WEAVERVILLE - Trinity County Sheriff's deputies say they shot a woman to death after she fired a rifle during a confrontation with deputies and with a Realtor who was showing the home where the woman had been living.

Deputies say Shirley Jean Peeler, 51, of Mad River, died after being shot in the torso Thursday. They said they received a call of shots fired near Highway 36 and Mad River Road around 10:12 a.m.

A Realtor told authorities he'd been showing a property to prospective buyers when Peeler confronted him while carrying a rifle.

The property had belonged to Peeler's parents, but she had been ordered to leave the land after it was placed on the market, deputies said.

Deputies said peeler fired a shot at the Realtor as he fled. When they arrived, they found Peeler still armed with the rifle. They tried to negotiate with Peeler, who then fired a shot and threatened deputies.

Deputies said they then fired at Peeler, who succumbed to her wounds and was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:05 p.m.

The Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, California Department of Justice and California Highway Patrol are investigating the case alongside the Trinity County Sheriff's Office.
