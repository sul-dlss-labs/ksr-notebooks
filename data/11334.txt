Xavier Gonzalez-Torres, a 30-year-old Latino, was shot and killed by sheriff deputies Saturday, May 12, in the 15500 block of Stafford Street in Industry, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Deputies had responded to a call of a carjacking in La Puente. Moments later, deputies spotted the car, a white Dodge Charger, on Temple Avenue in La Puente, and a short chase ensued.

The chase ended in the 15500 block of Stafford Street, across the street from the sheriff’s station in the City of Industry, said sheriff’s Lt. Kimberly Unland.

The driver, later identified as Gonzalez-Torres, got out of the vehicle and fired a handgun at the deputies, who returned fire.

Gonzalez-Torres was struck by the gunfire and pronounced dead. A weapon was recovered at the scene, Unland said.

Per department procedure, the deputy-involved shooting is being investigated by department homicide detectives and internal affairs officers as well as investigators from the county district attorney’s office, she said.

Anyone with additional details about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
