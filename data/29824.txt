A car wanted in an out-of-state shooting fled police at high speeds and crashed in Summit County, killing two passengers.

Ohio State Highway Patrol Sgt. Ray Santiago said two passengers were killed in the crash. The driver and a third passenger are being treated in an area hospital for injuries not believed to be life threatening.

The incident started at about 8:27 a.m. Tuesday in Trumbull County. Santiago said troopers saw a Green 2010 BMW 528 traveling westbound on Interstate 80 at 94 mph.

Troopers tried to stop make a traffic stop near Lordstown, but the driver fled and a pursuit ensued. The BMW exceeded 100 mph during the chase. Santiago said they canceled the pursuit near mile marker 209 since they were headed into a work zone.

After the BMW made it past construction, troopers again saw the BMW and tried to make a traffic stop. The driver fled again, and the chase restarted, Santiago said.

The BMW continued west and got onto state Route 8 South. The driver then got off the highway and turned west onto Boston Mills Road. Due to the terrain, curved roads and high speeds, Troopers canceled the chase, Santiago said. But shortly after the trooper saw that the BMW had crashed.

Santiago said the car crashed at about 8:46 a.m. on Boston Mills Road, just west of Akron-Peninsula Road. The BMW went off the left side of the road, striking a guard rail before rolling over and coming to rest partially down an embankment.

Two people were pronounced dead at the scene. The other two were transported to local hospitals.

Santiago said Tuesday afternoon that they are not yet releasing the names of the four people in the BMW.

He said the patrol found out later that the car was a vehicle of interest in a Pennsylvania shooting. During the pursuit, Santiago said several items were thrown out of the car. Troopers are still working to gather all of them.

The Highland post of the patrol will lead the investigation into the crash, he said.
