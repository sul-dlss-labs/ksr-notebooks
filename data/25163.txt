Four North Florida Law Enforcement Agencies worked together to find a shooting suspect from Lake City on Saturday, October 6, 2018.

The night before, around 11:00pm, the Lake City Police Department got a reporter of a shooting on US Hwy 900. When they responded, they found a woman who had been shot in the arm.

Just minutes later, Police say, other officers found the car of the suspect, 51-year-old Kenneth Bingham, and attempted to pull him over and a car chase ensued.

Florida Highway Patrol Troopers joined the pursuit when Bingham made it to I-75, but eventually had to break it off after they lost sigh of him on off Exit 404.

Then, around 3:00am, Dixie County Sheriff's Deputies say found a car matching the description of Binghams at the El Dorado Motel in Cross City.

They attempted to talk to Bingham, to convince him to give up peacefully. The Columbia County SWAT Team came by to assist the deputies, and with the negotiations.

However, they say that after some time, they heard a gunshot from inside the suspected gunman's motel room, and when SWAT went inside, they found Bingham dead from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.

They had that the shooting victim is in stable condition and that no one else was hurt during the ordeal.
