STANLY COUNTY, N.C. -- A man suffered a cardiac arrest and died Thursday morning while fighting with police officers.

Around 4 a.m. Thursday morning, a police officer in Badin responded to a call for assistance from Marlon Lewis who said someone was chasing him.

Upon arrival, the officer got out of the patrol car and was attacked by Lewis, the same man who made the call for help.

Badin Police Chief says that while the officer tried to tase Lewis as a fight ensued between the two. The taser was deployed but had no effect, the chief said.

As Lewis was restrained and handcuffed, he went into cardiac arrest. EMS responded, but were unable to revive him.

The incident occurred on Dewey and Mayo Street.

The State Bureau of Investigation is investigating the incident.
