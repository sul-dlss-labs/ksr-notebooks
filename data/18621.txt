O'FALLON, Mo. â€¢ A man suspected of forcing his way into his daughter's St. Peters home fatally shot himself here Thursday night as he was approached by police outside a convenience store.

The man, 54, was sitting in his car with the windows closed when he shot himself in the head in the parking lot of a QuikTrip at 801 Belleau Creek Road, according to O'Fallon police. He was transported to a hospital, where he died of his injuries.

St. Peters police said the man's daughter had said in a 911 call that the man forced his way into her home in the 4000 block of Chadwick Lane at about 7 p.m.

She said he appeared highly intoxicated, displayed a gun and threatened to kill himself; she was hiding in a room in the home as she made the call. He left the home before police arrived.

Police then began looking for him to arrest him for home-invasion burglary but were also concerned about his well-being because of his suicidal statements.

Officers with O'Fallon, St. Peters and St. Charles County were called to the QuikTrip after his car was spotted there at about 8:30.

Police used a loudspeaker to tell the man to show his hands and leave the vehicle. A few moments later, the man shot himself before officers could reach the car, police said. The man didn't point his weapon at officers or threaten them and officers didn't fire their weapons, police said.

The identity of the man, who lived in O'Fallon, was not released.
