Luther Lathron Walker, a 38-year-old black man, was shot and killed by Los Angeles County sheriff’s deputies Monday, Aug. 18, in the 8800 block of Artesia Boulevard in Bellflower, according to Los Angeles County coroner’s records.

Deputies received a call about 5:30 a.m. from a woman who said she was being held hostage by a man who had a gun, according to a news release from the department. When deputies arrived at the apartment complex, they learned that the woman was being held against her will on the second floor.

Crisis negotiators with the department tried to make contact with the man over the span of six hours, according to the release. Residents were evacuated for their safety.

At one point, the woman appeared at a rear window and pleaded with special enforcement deputies to remove her. She threw her keys to one of the deputies, and while they were trying to rescue her, the man appeared in the window and began struggling with the woman.

“As a result, a deputy-involved shooting occurred,” according to the release.

The man, later identified as Walker, was pronounced dead at the scene at 11:41 a.m., said Ed Winter, the assistant chief of investigations for the coroner’s office.

Replica firearms were recovered, in addition to a knife, found near Walker, Lt. Steve Jauch said in an e-mail.

Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Department Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
