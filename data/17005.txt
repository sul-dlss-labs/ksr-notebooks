A man shot by a Mountain View police officer late Sunday during a traffic stop in Denver died.

Denver police, who are investigating the shooting, said Monday morning that the man was pronounced dead at a hospital.

The Mountain View officer has been placed on administrative leave, which officials say is routine, pending an investigation into the encounter.

The shooting happened just before 10 p.m. in the 5000 block of West 44th Avenue, where the officer was trying to confront the man during a traffic stop.

Mountain View police say the man got out of his vehicle armed with a shotgun, at which point the officer opened fire, discharging several shots.

“This suspect shot at me with a shotgun!” an officer called over his radio, recordings archived on Broadcastify.com show.

“(The suspect) is bleeding out!” someone called out shortly after.

Investigators have not released the name of the officer nor the man shot.

Police also have not released what prompted the officer to try to stop the man.

“The officer was catching up to the suspect,” Officer Kirk Firko, a Mountain View police spokesman, said.

Mountain View covers about 12 square blocks west of Denver and west of Sheridan Boulevard. The shooting occurred two blocks inside Denver after the officer followed the man out of Mountain View.

“At this time, the investigation is ongoing, and further information will be released as it becomes available,” Firko said in a news release.
