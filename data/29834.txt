An armed suspect who stole a bicycle then a car was killed in a shootout with police in southwest Miami-Dade Thursday afternoon, officials said.

Miami-Dade Police said officers responded to the area of 173rd Street and Homestead Avenue, where the shootout took place.

Officials said the suspect initially tried to steal a bicycle from a bus and got into a confrontation with the bike owner that led to the suspect pulling out a gun and shooting.

The suspect took the bike and ended up at a Chevron gas station at 9500 Colonial Drive, where he then started shooting at the gas station when an employee wouldn't let him inside, officials said.
