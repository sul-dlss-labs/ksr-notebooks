State police are investigating an officer-involved shooting in Montville that left a 53-year-old Norwich resident dead Sunday afternoon, police said.

State police said the Montville Police Department first responded to the Chesterfield Lodge near the corner of Route 85 and Grassy Hill Road around 2:30 p.m. for a report of an unwanted person on the property.

When officers arrived they asked the man to leave but the suspect engaged officers in a violent struggle, police said. On Tuesday, state police identified the man as Val Thomas.

According to police, Thomas grabbed a stun gun from one of the officers during the struggle and began beating an officer on the head with it. That officer drew a firearm and shot Thomas, according to police.
