John Aguilera, a 35-year-old Latino, was shot and killed Sunday, Feb. 14 by a SWAT officer from the West Covina Police Department in the 1800 block of West Badillo Street in West Covina, according to authorities. [An earlier version of this post incorrectly identified the law enforcement official who shot Aguilera as a member of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's SWAT team.]

The incident began about 10 p.m. Saturday when authorities were contacted about a domestic dispute. When they arrived at the scene, they found Aguilera holding a hostage at gunpoint, said Detective Dan McElderry of the Sheriffâ€™s Homicide Bureau. The hostage was later identified as Rico Sanchez, a friend of Aguilera's who had been staying with him for several weeks, according to detectives.

The standoff lasted until 12:30 a.m. At that point, a SWAT officer from the West Covina Police Department shot Aguilera who was pronounced dead at the scene. Sanchez was unharmed, McElderry said.

McElderry said that authorities were investigating what had led up to the incident. He said they are waiting for toxicology reports to determine whether Aguilera was under the influence of alcohol or drugs at the time.
