SUPERIOR – The Mineral County Sheriff's Department has released the names of the deputy and a local man involved in a fatal shooting at the Mineral County Fair on Friday night.

Sheriff Tom Bauer said Deputy Michael O'Brien shot and killed 53-year-old Mark Keckhaser after Keckhaser was driving erratically down an alley and swerved to hit O'Brien.

Deputies initially responded to a report of disturbance in the alley Friday about 9 p.m.

The responding deputy located Keckhaser, who allegedly was intoxicated, sitting in the driver's seat of a white sport utility vehicle. When deputies approached him, he drove away at a high rate of speed through the alley and toward the fairgrounds.

The department said O'Brien stepped into the alley and commanded the driver to stop. When he didn't stop, O'Brien fired his weapon at the man.

Keckhaser was pronounced dead at the scene.

Bauer said the department didn't have previous contact with Keckhaser, who recently moved to Superior from the Midwest.

"I know the (Montana Highway) Patrol has done some stuff with him, but as far as the sheriff’s office is concerned he’s unknown to us," Bauer said.

O'Brien is currently on paid administrative leave, while the Department of Criminal Investigations reviews the incident. Bauer said several witnesses to the shooting are being interviewed and the county attorney will hold a coroner's inquest at a future date.

Bauer said O'Brien has been with the department since June 2014 and has extensive experience in law enforcement.

A critical incident debriefing team from Missoula will visit the department in the coming days.

"From my understanding, they come out and talk to everyone involved," Bauer said.
