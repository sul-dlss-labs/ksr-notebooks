PLAINFIELD -- A 30-year-old Plainfield man was identified as the man who died in a fatal crash early Wednesday after leading police on a two-county chase.

An Edison police officer followed the car Dem-Quan Royal was driving from Edison into Plainfield, where Royal's car struck a tree on the 800 block of Woodland Avenue shortly after midnight, authorities said.

Royal was pronounced dead at the scene, the Union County Prosecutor's Office said.

Royal was previously convicted of heroin possession and shoplifting in October 2012 at Bob's Store, a clothing and shoe store, in Springfield.

Prosecutors ask anyone with information about Wednesday's crash to call Prosecutor's Office Sgt. Jose Vendas at 908-358-3048.
