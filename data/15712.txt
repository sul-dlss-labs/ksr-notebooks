NOCONA, Texas - A police officer responding to a domestic disturbance at a North Texas home has shot and killed an off-duty sheriff's deputy living there.

Nocona police Chief Kent Holcomb said the officer responded to the home Monday shortly after midnight.

Holcomb and Montague County Sheriff Paul Cunningham declined to release details of the shooting, saying the matter will be investigated by Texas Rangers.

Cunningham said 41-year-old deputy Larry Hostetter died at a hospital about an hour after the shooting. He had been a law enforcement officer since 2000 and was a married father of three children.

It's not clear what prompted the Nocona officer to fire his weapon and no other information was provided.

Nocona is about 50 miles southeast of Wichita Falls.
