A man walking down the street with a shotgun was shot and killed in front of a Miami middle school by police officers Thursday.

The incident happened around 5 p.m. outside Allapatah Middle School at Northwest 13th Place and 46th Street, after person flagged down an officer and told them a man was walking down the street armed with an AK-47.

Officers confronted the man, later identified as 22-year-old Brandon Foster and opened fire. Police didn't say if Foster had fired his gun, which turned out to be a shotgun.

Foster was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital, where he later died.

Miami Fire-Rescue spokesman Lt. Ignatius Carroll said a van carrying three medics that was responding to the scene was hit with bullets in the shootout.

"Coming close to being injured or shot is something very serious," said Carroll. "After all of that, our training kicked back in and we did what we're supposed to do and that's our job."

Miami Police Chief Miguel Exposito also responded to the scene, and said the shooting would continue to be investigated.

"We're looking to see if we can get some video because we do know that some of these schools have video cameras and we're hoping there's some video as to what occurred," Exposito said.
