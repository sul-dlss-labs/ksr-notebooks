December 21, 2013 (CHICAGO)

About 12:30 p.m., officers on patrol saw an armed carjacking in the 5000-block of South Princeton Avenue, police said. Officers drove after the stolen car, a Dodge Caravan, until it crashed into a Chevrolet Suburban near the intersection of 55th and Halsted.

A family friend identified the 11-year-old victim as Donovan Turnage. Witnesses say the child was thrown from the Suburban and landed in the street. He was taken to Comer Children's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

A family friend says Donovan, his brother and father were on their way to get haircuts before the holidays. He attended Morrill Math and Science Academy.

After the collision, the suspect managed to elude police who were following him by running across the street and carjacking another vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser.

Police say he drove that all the way to the western suburbs, where it ran out of gas on I-294 near Oakbrook. He abandoned it and flagged down another driver and carjacked a third vehicle.

Chicago police are looking at video of the suspect and the first collision from a security camera at the gas station.

"Yeah, they almost got him over here, but he was too fast," said Sam Mohamed, gas station attendant.

An investigation is underway. No one is in custody.
