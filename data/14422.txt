Fort Smith Times Record

A North Little Rock woman was killed on a Johnson County highway Sunday when her vehicle crashed into a creek after hitting a vehicle occupied by relatives.

Dive teams from the Johnson and Pope County sheriff’s offices located the body and vehicle of 61-year-old Carol Ruth Berry in the Piney channel creek between the Interstate 40 bridges following a crash that occurred at about 3:10 p.m. at the 70 mile marker on I-40 West. Berry’s body was found in the vehicle, according to a news release issued Monday by the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office.

Berry was driving a Toyota RAV4 in rainy conditions when she hit the rear of a 2006 Toyota Sienna occupied by four people, according to an Arkansas State Police fatal accident report.

The Sienna was occupied by relatives of Berry, according to the news release.

Following impact with the Sienna, Berry’s RAV4 entered the median, struck an embankment and went airborne, finally landing in the creek, the accident report states.

Dive teams entered the creek at about 4:30 p.m. and found Berry and her vehicle in 30-foot deep water, according to the news release.

Divers attached three flotation bags to the vehicle and floated it just below the surface where it was towed to the shoreline and lifted by a wrecker at 7:45 p.m., the news release states.

Johnson County Coroner Dave Cogan pronounced Berry dead at the scene, according to the news release.

Johnson County’s Rural Fire Department 5, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission and U.S. Forest Service personnel, as well as numerous volunteers, assisted Johnson deputies and state troopers at the scene.
