NEW CITY â€“ A 28-year-old Brooklyn man died early Friday in a motorcycle crash after being pursued by state police onto New Hempstead Road, according to a news release issued Monday.

Gregory Grant hit the curb rounding the bend near the county sheriff's office and was ejected from the bike, police said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Grant also had been pursued about an hour earlier by state police earlier on the Palisades Interstate Parkway, where he hit speeds of 100 miles per hour, before state police broke that pursuit off, they said.

The Journal News had been seeking information on the incident since Friday, when the investigation into the crash closed New Hempstead Road for more than seven hours.

In a press release posted to the department's website Monday afternoon, state police gave the following account:

A trooper saw a red motorcycle moving at more than 100 miles per hour on the PIP in Clarkstown at about 4:15 a.m. Friday. Attempts to pull over the biker failed, as the driver went faster. The trooper ended that chase for safety reasons.

About an hour later at 5:15 a.m., troopers saw the motorcycle traveling south on the PIP approaching exit 11, the ramp to New Hempstead Road in New City. When the biker left the PIP, the trooper activated the car's emergency lighting and tried to pull him over. The motorcyclist moved as if he was going to pull over, but then accelerated at a high rate of speed, turning left onto New Hempstead Road.

The troopers following him "observed a cloud of dust, and the motorcycle off the south shoulder of the roadway," the release said.

Local police agencies had told The Journal News they were not involved in the case. The Clarkstown police department did issue a statement on its Facebook page late Friday morning advising residents the road was closed and saying that a state police helicopter flying overhead was part of the investigation.
