Phoenix police said a 36-year-old woman died after an officer shot her as she pointed a gun at police.

About 8 p.m. Sunday, police received several calls about shots being fired, some indicating that a woman was firing shots, at an apartment complex near West Indian School Road and 23rd Avenue, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, police spokesman, said.

One of the calls was from a woman claiming she had shot several people in an alley behind an apartment complex at 2200 W. Heatherbrae Drive, police said. The woman hung up on officers several times as they were attempting to get more information, Howard said.

Witnesses directed officers to an apartment in the complex, and officers were able to safely remove one of the apartment's residents as well as residents from surrounding units, Howard said. They attempted to reach a woman in the apartment through an open door and by telephone, he said.

A woman appeared at the window of the apartment with a handgun, which she pointed at herself and waved it around the open window, Howard said. She suddenly pointed the gun at two officers, and one officer then opened fire.

The woman was transported to the hospital where she died of her injuries. Her identity was not immediately released pending notification of relatives.

The male officer who fired his weapon is 40 years old and has eight years of service, Howard said.

No officers were injured. As is standard protocol, the officer who opened fire has been put on paid administrative leave pending a review of the shooting.
