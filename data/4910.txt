On Tuesday, Elisha Cole and Tina Martin, children of the Rev. Nathaniel M. Cole, attended an NAACP press conference in front of Godâ€™s Revealing Tabernacle, where their father served as pastor until he was killed Monday evening when his vehicle was struck head-on by an SUV fleeing city police on the 7200 block of North Broadway.
