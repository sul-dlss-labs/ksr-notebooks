ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Police have released video showing an upstate New York police officer fatally shooting a 37-year-old man who had rammed his car into another officer last winter.

The video of the chaotic encounter with parolee Howard Tucker was combined from two sources: a newly installed police car dashboard camera and a surveillance camera trained on a street where Tucker was pulled over by two Albany police officers on Feb. 16.

The dashboard footage shows the officers on either side of Tucker's car just before he speeds away. The second camera captures Tucker's car skidding on a snow-covered street as the officers chase it on foot.
