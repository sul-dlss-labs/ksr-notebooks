A routine arrest Saturday night turned deadly, authorities said, when a man resisted, then was fatally shot by Colorado Springs police officers after he pulled a gun on them.

The shooting happened about 6 p.m. in the 1500 block of South Nevada Avenue near Navajo Street, police spokesman Lt. Howard Black said.

The man who was shot died at a local hospital. His name has not been released. The officers, who are on leave as required by city policy, were treated for minor injuries, Black said.

The officers had attempted to arrest the man on an outstanding warrant for an unspecified misdemeanor, according to the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office, which is investigating the shooting. Under state law, shootings involving law enforcement officers must be investigated by a neutral agency to avoid conflicts of interest.

The suspect fought with the officers before drawing a handgun. The Sheriff’s Office did not say if the man fired at officers before being shot.
