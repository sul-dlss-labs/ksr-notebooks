KIRKWOOD, N.Y. -- A 30-year-old man was shot and killed by a New York State trooper after the suspect opened fire with a “military style” rifle, according to New York State police.

Police in Binghamton got a report that Nicholas P. Philhower, 30, took his mom’s car without her permission, and she asked police to stop and arrest him, state police said in a news release.

At around 6:20 p.m., Trooper Timothy S. Conklin, a 28-year veteran of the department, saw the vehicle heading west on State Route 17 in Kirkwood, police said.

As the trooper approached in his vehicle, Philhower drove his car across the median of State Route 17 where it meets Interstate 81 and then on to eastbound State Route 17. He stopped his car shortly after.

Just after he stopped, Philhower shot at the trooper through the rear window of his vehicle. He was armed with what police said was a “military style semi-automatic rifle," according to the news release.

Conklin, the trooper, returned fire through the windshield of his police vehicle. Philhower exited his car and walked toward the trooper, still firing his rifle.

Conklin reloaded his weapon, left his car and continued firing at Philhower. That’s when he hit the suspect several times. Philhower died at the scene, according to the news release.

Conklin suffered a minor shrapnel injury to his upper right arm. He was treated and released today from Wilson Hospital in Johnson City.

State police released a photo showing Conklin’s car with bullet holes in the windshield.

Philhower’s body was taken to Lourdes Hospital for an autopsy, police said.

State police are still investigating, conducting witnesses interviews and will search the suspect’s car and home when they get a warrant, police said.
