Police responded to the Baby Grand Piano Bar after receiving a call that a person had been hit by a vehicle.

The officer encountered the suspected vehicle, and the officer, along with an armed security guard, discharged their weapons, according to authorities.

Willie Ivey III, 29, then drove the vehicle out of the parking lot and wrecked a short distance later, authorities said.

Ivey was transported to Grady Memorial Hospital, where he later died.

A witness who did not want to be identified said Ivey was never inside bar. The witness said police were already chasing Ivey when he pulled into the lot and tried to hit an officer with his car.

The Georgia Bureau of Investigation is still investigating.

Neighbors said the incident is unfortunate, but not out of the ordinary.

"It's not uncommon, you know, especially when the clubs let out over here. That's what happens. That's the type of lifestyle that's over here, so it's not shocking at all," neighbor Courtney McBride said.
