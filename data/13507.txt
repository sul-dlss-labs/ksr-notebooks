ST. LOUIS • A 25-year-old man was fatally shot and a police officer wounded after a chase Saturday afternoon that began when police thought they spotted a drug deal.

The officer was shot in the foot, and was taken to an area hospital, where he was listed in stable condition.

Police identified the deceased man as, Jared Harris, of the 9500 block of Vallette Drive.

Police Chief Sam Dotson said police observed what they thought was a hand-to-hand drug deal on McMillan Avenue and tried to stop the vehicle, a dark gray Camaro, about 4 p.m.

The fleeing car crashed a few blocks away, at North Taylor and Garfield avenues, and the driver began shooting at police, hitting one officer in the left foot, police said.

Two officers returned fire, killing the driver.

The officer who killed the suspect is 29 and has been on the force about five years. The other officer, 47, has been on the force 14 years.

Police arrested two male passengers, one 28 years old and one 18, in the crashed car and recovered a handgun just outside the car.

Police believe the driver might have fled because he had a criminal history and possibly was on probation.

The apparent drug deal that caught the officers’ attention was in the Fountain Park area, one of two neighborhoods the department has targeted for a “hot spot” policing strategy. The goal is to flood the area with extra officers to crack down on recent violence.

“I think (today’s shooting) goes to the point of how dangerous the job is,” Dotson said.
