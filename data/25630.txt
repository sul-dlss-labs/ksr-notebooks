The Springfield Police Department has released the name of the man shot and killed Monday night by an officer.

Bryan Ryder, 38, of Springfield, was shot after he came after officers with a knife at an apartment complex at 2752 S. Meadowbrook Ave., according to a news release from the department.

The release says officers were dispatched to the apartments at about 7:30 p.m. after a neighbor heard a woman yelling for help.

When officers arrived, the release says they heard a woman screaming for help outside of a second-floor apartment, so they forced their way inside.

The officers saw Ryder inside the apartment and gave him verbal commands, but he did not comply and instead moved toward the officers with a knife in his hand, according to the release.

Officers also contacted a woman at the scene whom they believe had been assaulted by Ryder. She was treated for non-life-threatening injuries.

No officers were injured during the encounter.

A police department spokeswoman said the name of the officer who fired the shots will be released after interviews are completed, which is expected to be by the end of the week. The officer has been placed on administrative leave.
