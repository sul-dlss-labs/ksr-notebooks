WARREN COUNTY â€¢ A man from St. Peters died in a high-speed crash after fleeing from police in Truesdale late Sunday night, police say.

Ted D. Fitzgerald, 27, died at the scene of the crash on Veterans Memorial Parkway at South Strack Church Road in Wright City. That area is about three miles from Truesdale.

At about 10:33 p.m. Sunday, Fitzgerald was driving a 2006 Chevrolet 1500 east on Veterans Memorial Parkway. The Missouri Highway Patrol said he was fleeing from Truesdale police at a high rate of speed.

Truesdale police wanted to stop Fitzgerald for speeding, a highway patrol spokesman said this morning. Truesdale police said in a statement that the truck failed to yield to a police officer and that the officer was about 1/4 mile behind the truck when he lost sight of its tail lamps.

On a curve, the truck hit a guardrail and overturned. Fitzgerald, who wasn't wearing a seatbelt, was thrown out of the vehicle. The officer was in the process of calling off the traffic stop when he came across the accident, Truesdale police said.

After Fitzgerald was ejected, the truck continued out of control, hitting the guardrail on the east side of South Strack Church Road. It traveled across Veterans Memorial, hitting another guardrail and landing in a field.

Warren County Coroner Roger Mauzy pronounced Fitzgerald dead at the scene at 11:51 p.m. The highway patrol is investigating the incident.

According to the Missouri Department of Corrections, Fitzgerald was under the supervision of a Missouri probation and parole office for resisting arrest, possession of controlled substance and distribution of a controlled substance. Court records indicate those crimes were in 2003 and 2004 in St. Charles County; his overall sentence was 13 years.
