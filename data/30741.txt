DETROIT – Police are investigating a fatal officer-involved shooting that occurred late Sunday night on Detroit’s east side.

According to Detroit police, about 200 people and cars were drag racing and drifting on Sunday on East Grand Boulevard near East Milwaukee Avenue, near the General Motors Factory ZERO plant. Undercover Detroit police officers were reportedly in the area in an unmarked vehicle.

Second Deputy Chief Rudy Harper told Local 4 that just before midnight, the undercover officers’ vehicle was hit by another car. The front seat passenger of the vehicle reportedly exited the car with a handgun, and one of the undercover officers opened fire at the man, striking and killing him.

Officials say the officer fired several rounds at the man, possibly four. Detroit police say they are still determining if the man pointed the handgun at officers before police opened fire on him. The involved officers were still giving their statements, officials said.

The identity of the man who was shot and killed has not yet been released. Police say they are waiting to notify family first.

The vehicle that struck the undercover officers’ vehicle was reportedly stolen out of Dearborn. Police say three other people were inside that car during the incident, and they are still looking for those people.

No other details have been released at this time. This is an ongoing investigation.
