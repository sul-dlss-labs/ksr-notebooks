SOUNDVIEW, The Bronx — A man was fatally shot by officers after he refused to drop his gun at the Soundview Houses in the Bronx Sunday overnight.

Police responded to a 911 call about gunshots fired in the vicinity of the housing complex at 1725 Randall Ave. around 1:50 a.m. When they arrived, they found a man, identified as 25-year-old Rashaun Lloyd, with a gun. He refused to drop the gun and pointed it at officers when they ordered him to, police said.

Three officers then fired their guns, striking him 31 times.

Lloyd was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

A Hi-Point 9mm gun was recovered at the scene.

Lloyd is a father to a 4-year-old boy.

“He never had a chance, they killed him. Why did they shot him in the leg, why did they have to go for the kill?,” Lloyd’s cousin told PIX11 News.

There is an ongoing investigation.
