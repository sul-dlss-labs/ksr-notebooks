Investigation into Man's Death Following Incident at 3625 Lockwood

February 8, 2016

- Houston police are awaiting autopsy results in the death of a man following an incident at 3625 Lockwood about 6:50 p.m. last Friday (Feb. 5).

The male, Michael Wayne Simmons King, 40, was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Hospital.

HPD Homicide Division Seniors Police Officers C. Elder and N. Sharp reported:

King entered the Salina Food Mart at 3625 Lockwood and began acting erratically with customers and staff. The manager asked King to leave and he refused. Employees tried to convince King to leave, but when they put their hands on King he passively resisted. Employees were able to remove King from the store when officers arrived. King also passively resisted the officers and refused to obey all verbal commands. Officers were eventually able to gain control of King and took him into custody. Houston Fire Department paramedics evaluated King at the scene before he was released back to HPD officers. King was then transported to jail for possession of a controlled substance.

Upon arrival, King was found unresponsive in the patrol vehicle. Officers immediately began CPR until paramedics arrived and transported King to the hospital where he was later pronounced dead.

As is customary in in-custody deaths, this incident is being investigated by the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Division.
