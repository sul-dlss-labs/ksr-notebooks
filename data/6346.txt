They didn't even see it coming... A total of three drivers involved in wreck following a high speed chase that ended at the intersection of Highways 165 and 26 in Oberlin. All of the parties involved suffered injuries with one woman pronounced dead at the scene.

State Police say it's all because of a maroon Ford pick-up truck, clocked speeding by Oberlin Police on Highway 165 near mile post 26. "The reason for the stop is because the officer clocked him at 72 in a 55. He turned his unit around and tried to initiate a stop on the vehicle at which time the vehicle had sped up to speeds approximately 110 to 115 miles per hour," said T.F.C. Jeff Johnson.

Approaching the busy intersection, the officer called for backup. Oberlin Police Chief Richard Young and another officer positioned their cars to try and block the driver in. Never applying his breaks the driver veered into the inside lane hitting a blue car at the stop light causing a chain reaction of crashes with two other vehicles. Officers say the woman driving the blue car is believed to have died on impact.

Chief Young saw it all unfold and tells 7 News: "We did everything we could to try and stop him, but it was clear he had no intention of stopping."

"They were doing exactly what they were supposed to do," said Johnson.

Further investigation, revealed the maroon Ford pickup truck was reported stolen in Ohio. Its driver was taken to a hospital in Kinder to be treated for injuries. The accident remains under investigation by State Police.

At this time, State Police are withholding the name of the female victim pending notification of next of kin. We're also told the other drivers involved in the accident were also taken to the hospital with unknown injuries. Meanwhile, still no word on what charges the driver of the stolen pickup truck will face. At last check, no arrest has yet to be made.
