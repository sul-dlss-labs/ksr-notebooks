ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. â€” A man who was injured in a crash while fleeing Florida Highway Patrol troopers in September has died, according to FHP.

Troopers said James Maddux, 30, died Sunday from injuries he sustained in the Orange County accident Sept. 25.

According to troopers, during the traffic stop Maddux, from Orlando, was asked to get out of his car, but instead drove off and crashed before the FHP trooper could return to his vehicle.

Troopers said Maddux ran a red light and was struck by another car. Maddux's car then caught fire. A passenger in the car with Maddux suffered critical injuries in the crash.

Maddux, a registered sex offender, was in a similar crash after fleeing troopers during a previous traffic stop.

Troopers said Maddux had a blood alcohol level of .195 when he crashed his car in September. The legal limit in Florida is .08.
