URBANDALE, Iowa (AP) -- Four officers involved in two suburban police shootings have been cleared by their departments.

Urbandale police announced Wednesday they completed a review of the Feb. 26 shooting deaths of two alleged bank robbers.

Police officers Dennis Vinson and Chad Krull shot Henry Charles Simmons and his brother, Paul Simmons, during a police chase after they stopped their van on Interstate Highway 80/35. Charles Simmons died at the scene. His brother died of gunshot wounds later at a local hospital.

Vinson and Krull are allowed to return to work but neither has decided yet to do so, Sgt. Doug Hobart said.

Iowa State Patrol Trooper Dennis McMahon was working with the two officers and also shot at the Simmonses. He has returned to patrol duties, Iowa State Patrol Sgt. Rob Hansen said.

The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is investigating both shootings.

In a separate case, West Des Moines Officer William Taylor has returned to work and assigned to administrative duty after a March 20 shooting that left one man dead.

Taylor was responding a report that a woman's estranged husband, Jeffrey Fletcher, was at her home in violation of a court order. Taylor and Officer Brenda Davis tried to coax Fletcher out of the house when he lunged at them with a shard of glass.

Taylor fired, hitting Fletcher in the chest.

Davis is on a six-week military leave and will be reassigned when she returns, West Des Moines Sgt. Jim Barrett said.

Grand juries have been asked to consider the circumstances surrounding both cases and will determine if the shootings were justified.

The Urbandale case is set to be presented in May, followed by the West Des Moines case in June.
