Rodney Carl Sandberg, 24, a white man, was shot multiple times inside a trailer home in an officer-involved shooting at 1820 Torrance Blvd. in Torrance about 9:44 p.m. Saturday, March 15. He was declared dead at the scene by paramedics.

According to Lt. Tom Stark, police officers responded to a call regarding a suicide. Upon arrival, officers encountered Sandberg holding a steak knife to his chest. Relatives were evacuated from the home.

Officers then ordered Sandberg to drop the knife. Multiple Taser shocks administered by three officers were ineffective, Stark said.

Sandberg was shot multiple times when he allegedly advanced toward officers with the knife, said Lt. Lloyd DeGonia. It was unclear how many officers fired their weapons, authorities said. Sandberg's stepfather, Monte Self, 47, said he heard four or five shots.

According to Self, Sandberg had been drinking most of the day. He became angered when Self and his mother confronted him about his alcohol use. Self said Sandberg called police and told the dispatcher that someone had committed suicide. He then picked up a kitchen knife and pointed it at himself.

Self said he was able to calm Sandberg down for a few minutes, but that he became angry again when officers arrived at the home.

Sandberg leaves behind a wife in Texas. Self said he had been released from prison four months ago and was working for a labeling company. His parole was going to end in December.

Self said Sandberg's drinking was linked to a bad childhood. His father would physically abuse his mother in front of him. When his mother ran off, Sandberg was left with his father, who also physically abused him, Self said.

He grew up through several foster care homes until he was 18, he added. "He had a lot of anger and bottled it in a lot," Self said.
