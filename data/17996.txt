AUGUSTA, Ga. (WJBF-TV) — A Richmond County deputy was injured Saturday night after responding to a call about a man in distress at a motel.

It happened on Washington Road at the Masters Inn.

Deputies responded after there were reports of a man in a hotel room who may hurt himself.

When the first deputy showed up, he tried to make contact, but there was a gunshot and he got glass in his eyes.

From there, the SWAT team tried to make contact with the man, but were unable to, so they burst into the room. The body of the man inside was found with a gunshot wound.

The Richmond County Coroner’s Office tells us that the person inside died from a self-inflicted gun shot wound before deputies went inside.

His identity hasn’t been released yet.

There’s no word on how the injured deputy is doing.
