MONTGOMERY -- The Alabama Bureau of Investigation is looking into the second shooting involving a Montgomery police officer.

Major Huey Thornton, a police spokesman, said a male in his 20s was shot and killed early Thursday just after 2 a.m. It happened at an apartment complex on Wesley Drive.

Thornton said 3 officers responded to a call by a 39-year-old mother and her 20-year-old daughter who said they fought off a man who tried to rape the younger woman who is 6 months pregnant. Both women were treated for knife wounds.

The unidentified suspect was shot when he attacked an officer.

It was the second shooting this week involving a Montgomery police officer. Over the weekend, a man was shot in the shoulder in a case of mistaken identity.
