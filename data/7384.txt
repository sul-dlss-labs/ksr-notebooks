Chicago police shot and killed an armed man who shot at officers and then hid in a gangway on the South Side, police said.

The gunman, identified Wednesday as Brandon Teague, 25, hit one officer's shoe and the bulletproof vest of another, but wounded neither one, police said. He also opened fire with his semiautomatic gun on a police helicopter hovering over Auburn Gresham, police said.

Police approached Teague at 79th and Justine Streets about 10:30 p.m. Tuesday because they thought he appeared suspicious. He opened fire, shooting an officer in the shoe without hitting the foot, police said.

Teague then ran to a gangway outside a nearby building at 79th and Bishop Streets to seek refuge, prompting SWAT officers to respond, police said. Teague fired multiple shots at the officers and at the police helicopter overhead, police said.

At some point, he opened fire on one of the SWAT officers, striking him in his protective vest. The bullet became lodged in a vest pocket, police said.

Police eventually shot Teague and found what was believed to be the gun used in shooting the officers, said Monique Bond, Chicago police spokeswoman.

The standoff lasted until about 12:30 a.m., police said.
