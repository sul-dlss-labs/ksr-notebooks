Jose Monteon Jr., identified by the coroner's office as a 19-year-old white man, was fatally shot by a deputy Friday, April 8, in the 200 block of East Avenue R in Palmdale, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.

Deputies responded to a “man with a gun” call. When they arrived, they found Monteon armed at the scene.

They ordered him to put his gun down, but he didn’t comply, authorities said. He was shot and hit “multiple times” then taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Coroner's records show Monteon was hit with at least eight to 11 rounds in the torso, arm, leg and head.

No deputies were injured.

Sheriff’s officials said the weapon was recovered.

Like all officer-involved shootings, the incident is under investigation.
