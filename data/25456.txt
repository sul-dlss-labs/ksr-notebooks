Since 1996. My brother. You were different. Everything about you. Rough edges. Big heart. Never took your blessings for granted. Never, forgot your past. You were a Cop’s Cop. And not in a Hollywood bull**** way. But legit. Strong headed. Strong heart. And flat out strong. At the core you saw it as good versus evil. You were wise enough to see that tug of war play out in your own life. That the journey was every, single, day. You expressed your own weaknesses. You stood firm with your beliefs. Your relationship with Jesus Christ. Your bedrock. And you were always looking to lift someone else up. And if a bad guy needed to be put down, you were all in.



And I loved how the Cop thing never defined you; it was your job. You were proud of the legacy of service but not badge heavy. Not better than others. Not above others. Without hesitation, you would put yourself in harms way. You would earn it. Every, single, day.



I struggle with this journey. Like so many others. Not the least, your family. I know you are proud of each and every one of them. And you are sending them your love, prayers and guidance. I feel inept at trying to ease their burden. Yet, I am constantly humbled by their love. You are with them Rod, and they with you. And I pray, they continue their journey with love. Every. Single. Day. Please give Roe a hug for me my brother. And look into me from time to time.



“To say that I am made in the image of God is to say that love is the reason for my existence, for God is love. Love is my true identity. Selflessness is my true self. Love is my true character. Love is my name.”
