VAN METER (AP) - A Dallas County man who was shot and killed by police was upset over a property line dispute, a neighbor said.

Melvin Eugene Nagle, 57, of Adel, became belligerent and pulled a handgun, Toni Robison said in a copyright story in The Des Moines Register.

"We walked over and asked what was up," Robison said. "He was messing with my gate and my fence and started yelling at me and being belligerent. He threw the gate at me. He pulled a handgun. It was pointed up, but not at me."

Robison's friend called 911 and deputies soon arrived.

"They told us to stay here and they would go see what was going on," Robison said.

Four officers - an Adel police officer, two Dallas County sheriff's deputies and an Iowa State Patrol trooper - fired because Nagle pointed the gun at them, said Dallas County Chief Deputy Brian Gilbert.

The officers, who were not identified, have been placed on administrative leave.

Nagle's family was upset by some officers' comments that Nagle was trying to commit "suicide by police officer."

"He wasn't planning suicide, and he wouldn't have hurt anyone," said Nagle's sister, Ann Bopp, 61, of Winterset. "He was a very peaceful man."

Gilbert said he'd heard the suicide speculation, but "I doubt in a circumstance like this we will ever know one way or another."

Melvin Nagle's relatives said that he had been drinking Saturday and was upset by the fact that his divorce had become final earlier in the week.
