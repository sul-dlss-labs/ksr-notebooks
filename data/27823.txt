NOTE: Suspect killed in Tuesday, April 7 Standoff has been identified as Kelvin Parks, 54, of Florence.

FLORENCE-On Monday, April 6 the Florence Police Department responded to a shooting that had taken place in the 400 block of Plum Street at around 10:30 AM. Police Chief Ron Tyler identified the shooting victim as Nathan Bevis.

Chief Tyler did not identify the suspect who was shot and died pending notification of next of kin. Tyler did say the shooter and the victim were acquainted but he did not know details of the relationship.

Officers got information that the shooting suspect had fled the area on a bicycle. Officers searched the area which included a strip of woods long East Limestone Street where they found a bicycle. While continuing the search police officers located the suspect at approximately 11:00 AM.

According to Chief Tyler the area where the suspect was hiding was a thick wooded area where the undergrowth was heavy and difficult to see into.

Police began negotiations with the suspect which continued for four hours.

“He was armed; he was concealing himself and he was threatening self-harm,” Tyler said. “Our officers showed a great deal of restraint for four hours as they negotiated with this individual.

“Toward the end of the day he gave an ultimatum, and ultimately he started shooting at our officers and our officers returned fire and the suspect is now deceased.”

Chief Tyler said members of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency were helping at the scene and that they would be taking over the investigation, which is standard procedure for an officer-involved shooting.

According to Tyler the suspect gave officers no choice after he began firing on them. Tyler said he was thankful that all Florence Police Officers were safe and sound after multiple shots had been fired in both directions.
