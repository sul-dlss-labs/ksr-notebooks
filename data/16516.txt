WASHINGTON — A man shot Friday during a struggle for a Prince George’s County police officer’s gun had recently expressed “suicidal thoughts” to a family member, police said.

Asshams Pharoah Manley, 30, of the 3400 block of Princes Grace Court in Forestville, was shot in District Heights during a scuffle over a patrol officer’s weapon, police said.

Police said Manley suffered from mental health issues. A family member told investigators that he had recently expressed suicidal thoughts.

The patrolman involved in the shooting, Officer Brian Bell, has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. Bell has been on the force for two years.

Police said Bell was on patrol near Brooks Drive and Marlboro Pike when he heard a car crash and went to investigate. Manley was seen running away from the crash scene, police said.

Bell caught up to Manley in his cruiser. At some point there was a struggle over Bell’s gun, which fired and hit Manley.

Police claimed that despite the gunshot wound, Manley continued to fight with Bell. A second officer deployed a stun gun and a third officer restrained him, police said.

Manley was taken to the hospital in critical condition and later died from his injuries.

Opiates and marijuana were found in his system, police said.
