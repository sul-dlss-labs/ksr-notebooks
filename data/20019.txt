The man found dead five hours after Easton police surrounded a College Hill home Monday night committed suicide, according to Northampton County Coroner Zachary Lysek.

Lysek identified the man pronounced dead at the house on the 300 block of Cattell Street as 32-year-old Brandon Buss. The cause of death was a gunshot wound.

Easton police had initially surrounded the home shortly after 5 p.m. Monday on a report that Buss was armed and acting erratically. As the standoff continued, police used a bullhorn to call on Buss to give himself up.

“This is the Easton police,” an officer said. “Come to the window or the door and show yourself with your hands up. We want to be sure you are OK in there. We are concerned about your safety.”

Police repeated this message several times while Buss’ relatives stood in a nearby Wawa parking lot watching the activity.

After failing to get a response from Buss, police at 8:40 p.m. set off a flash-bang device at the front of the building. But there was still no reaction, and they resumed pleas for Buss to surrender.

At 9:40 p.m. police sent a robot into the house and Buss’ body was discovered.

No one else was reported injured in the standoff.
