Details [ edit ]

As Kleinert was questioning Jackson concerning why he identified himself to bank employees as a different bank customer and requested access to the account, Jackson ran. Kleinert chased Jackson, enlisted the aid of a passing motorist, and followed on foot under a bridge where a struggle took place.[2][3] Kleinert's weapon unintentionally discharged striking Jackson in the back of the neck.[1] Kleinert reported that the shooting was accidental. Jackson did not have a weapon on him but had not been searched before running.[3][4]

Aftermath [ edit ]

After the incident, Kleinert retired from the police force.[5] He was indicted for manslaughter in May 2014. The Austin City Council approved a $1.25 million settlement to Jackson's children in August 2014. Austin Attorney Bobby Taylor represented the children of Larry Jackson.[6] In October 2015, after being removed to federal court a federal judge ruled that Kleinert, a member of an FBI task force, was acting in his capacity as a federal officer. The judge dismissed the case with prejudice asserting the Supremacy Clause applied.[7]
