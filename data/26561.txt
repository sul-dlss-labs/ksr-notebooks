TAVARES — A multi-agency pursuit of two alleged robbers ended in a fatality Wednesday when one of the suspects shot himself, authorities say.

According to the Lake County Sheriff's Office, Lake deputies and Tavares police responded to the AT&T store at 600 W. Burleigh Blvd. about 3:45 p.m. after receiving a call that two armed men in ski masks — later identified as John Ilienens, 22, and Rha-heen Rashawn White, 20 — threatened employees with handguns and stole thousands of dollars in cash and merchandise.

Deputies managed to pursue the suspects, who were driving in the same vehicle, through Lake and to the Orange County line. According to officials with the Orange County Sheriff's Office, they received a call for mutual aid around 4 p.m. from LCSO and caught up to the suspects after the LCSO deputy reportedly lost sight of them.

According to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, the two suspects crashed their vehicle at the entrance to the Seminole Ridge Apartments on Silver Star Road in Orlando. Both of them reportedly bailed from the car and ran away.

Deputies caught up with White and detained him without incident, the Orange County Sheriff's Office reported. But Ilienens kept running and eventually shot himself. Orange County Fire Rescue was deployed to the scene for treatment as deputies provided CPR, but Ilienens was pronounced dead at the scene.

White, arrested on a warrant from Tavares, was charged with armed robbery, grand theft between $5,000 and $10,000, battery and aggravated assault with the intent to commit a felony.

He is being held at the Orange County Jail, where bail is set at $58,000.
