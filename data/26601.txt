KATY, Texas – A man was killed in an officer-involved shooting Sunday afternoon in the Katy area.

The shooting was reported in the 2400 block of Wassail Way.

Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said they started receiving 911 calls around 5 p.m. about a disturbance between a husband and wife. Gonzalez said there were reports that the male was intoxicated and shots were fired inside of the location.

“When deputies arrived they made sure that the female and possibly two teenagers that were with her were safe. At that point, again this is rapidly unfolding, the deputies began to set up a perimeter to secure the safety of the rest of the community out here," Gonzalez said.

He said the man then fled the initial scene and began jumping over fences when he came across an officer as he was setting up a perimeter. Gonzalez said the man showed a pistol and the deputy fired his weapon, shooting and killing the man.

“We don’t yet know if there was a struggle or request or demand from the officer. There is a pistol that was recovered out there,” Gonzalez said.

He said the deputy involved has been with HCSO for four years. The deceased male was approximately in his late 30s to mid-40s.
