Two high-speed motorcycle chases late Thursday and early Friday resulted in one death and one arrest.

Chad Alan Woods, 33, was pronounced dead at St. John Medical Center after fleeing a trooper late Thursday at speeds of about 120 mph, the Oklahoma Highway Patrol reported.

The trooper tried to stop Woods' 2003 Honda for speeding on Interstate 44 near Admiral Boulevard about 9 p.m., but the bike exited onto Cincinnati Avenue, ran a red light and re-entered the highway before crashing as Woods tried to exit onto 33rd West Avenue, troopers said.

Woods was thrown from the motorcycle, which missed the exit ramp, ran down an embankment and skidded across 33rd West Avenue, troopers said.

He was not wearing a helmet, the OHP reported.

Woods was wanted for failing to pay costs associated with a domestic assault and battery conviction from 2010, records show. He also had felony drug and misdemeanor traffic convictions in 2006 and malicious injury and hit-and-run convictions in 2008.

In a separate incident, Angel Gabriel Rossainzz, 22, of Broken Arrow, was arrested after a trooper tried to stop him for speeding in a construction zone near Harvard Avenue on the Broken Arrow Expressway about 12:15 a.m. Friday, according to an arrest report.

The chase reached speeds of 130 mph as the motorcycle fled east, exited south onto Sheridan Road and eventually headed west on 71st Street, the report says.

Rossainzz was found and arrested at an apartment complex about 12:50 a.m. after briefly eluding the trooper, the report says.

He was booked into the Tulsa Jail on complaints of eluding, speeding in a construction zone and having an improper tag. He was released about 5:20 a.m. after posting $5,200 bail, records show.
