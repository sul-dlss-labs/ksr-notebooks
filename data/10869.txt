Roberto Rodriguez, a 32-year-old Latino, was fatally shot by a sheriff’s deputy Saturday, Dec. 17, in the 400 block of Solano Avenue in Elysian Park, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

The shooting occurred shortly before 5 a.m. Firefighters arrived at the scene of a house fire and were fired upon by Rodriguez, authorities say.

They flagged down a passing transit services sheriff's deputy returning to his Metrolink office, said Steve Whitmore, spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.

The deputy shot Rodriguez, Whitmore said, and he died half an hour later at a hospital.

Whitmore said later that Rodriguez hadn't fired at anyone, but was brandishing a gun at firefighters and later pointed it at the deputy and ignored repeated commands to drop the weapon.

No one else was hurt.

Los Angeles Fire Department arson-counter-terrorism detectives were investigating the fire, a Fire Department official said.

Anyone with additional details about the shooting is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Tipsters who would like to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
