ST. JOHNS COUNTY, Fla. â€“ The St. Johns County Sheriff's Office continues to investigate why deputies shot and killed 28-year-old Justin Edward Way, who was apparently threatening suicide in World Golf Village.

Investigators said deputies were called to the Legends Condominiums around 4:30 p.m. Monday by a woman in the same condo with the man who was shot.

When deputies arrived they said the man was holding a large knife and something happened that prompted them to open fire officials said.

According to reports, there were two deputies inside the home when the shooting happened but officials did not say if one or both of the deputies fired.



Both deputies will be placed on administrative leave during the investigation, which is standard procedure.



The sheriff's office said it can't release the name of the woman who called 911 and met deputies outside the home to say she was concerned the man was going to kill himself.



"Let's hold off on any sort of speculation. Let's get into the investigation. We've got some interviews to do with individuals who knew the subject to determine what was going on, what his state of mind was. That's all part of what we do in investigation," Sheriff's Office Cmdr. Chuck Mulligan said.

This is the first deputy-involved shooting of the year in St. Johns County. The department had five in 2014, the most in any one year in its history.
