Cops shot and killed a Brooklyn man holding a knife Tuesday night â€” after a stun gun had no effect on him, police said.

The man's sister, who called 911, let the cops into the home. When 63-year-old James Owens saw the officers he grabbed a 13-inch knife and refused to put it down, police said.

One of the cops fired a Taser, but it "didn't make complete contact," a police source said. Another officer then fired his gun three times, sources said, hitting Owens in the face, neck and chest.

"Immediately two shots went off and I was so scared so I got back in my car and got low," he said.

Edwards didn't know Owens by name, but described him as calm and unassuming.

"When they came out, you can see he's dead, there's no life, he's lifeless," he said.

Cops recovered the knife at the scene, sources said.
