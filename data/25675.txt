The coroner said Mahrt had multiple gun shot wounds.

Police said the exchange happened at Walgreens at Horn Lake and Goodman Roads in the middle of rush hour Tuesday evening.

“One male approached the other,” said Horn Lake Police Capt. Joseph Keene. “He pulled out a knife and stabbed the male around the neck area. Upon getting struck by the blade, the second male pulled out a hand gun and shot the other male.”

Police said the man who was stabbed is an off-duty Memphis police officer. The officer has been released from the hospital.

Horn Lake officials said the off-duty MPD officer pulled into the parking lot at Walgreens and went to the Redbox outside.

Mahrt then followed him, officials said, and confronted him before stabbing the off-duty officer in the neck.

The whole thing stemmed from a road rage incident, officials said.

MPD is investigating and won’t release the officer’s name because they said he is the victim in this case. They specified that the gun used was not his police-issued weapon.

Mahrt’s fiance, Krystall Johnson, says the story doesn’t sound right and wants to see surveillance video for herself. She and Mahrt were together for almost eight years and moved from Illinois to Horn Lake a few years ago.

"He can yell and scream, but he will not touch somebody unless he's touched first or he's provoked," Johnson said.

Horn Lake police said they are reviewing the surveillance video.

Horn Lake police said it is their policy to not release victims’ names and will not identify that off-duty MPD officer.

Police also say this is being investigated as an aggravated assault and homicide.
