SAN ANTONIO â€“ A man is dead and a veteran San Antonio Police Department officer on leave after a shooting outside a North Side bar early Saturday.

The officer responded to the sound of gunfire near Vance Jackson and Mossrock just after 2 a.m.

When he arrived he found 29-year-old Richard Castilleja aiming a gun at people outside Dad's Karaoke Bar.

Police say the officer feared for the safety of the people and fired at Castilleja, killing him.

Investigators say it was the end to a wild scene that saw Castilleja firing into the crowd, wounding two people and threatening others.

They say the officer worked a wreck nearby when he heard the shooting and rushed toward the sound.

Investigators say the officer had no choice but to shoot the gunman in order to protect others.

Police say Castilleja and a woman, identified by police as 25-year-old Desiree Castilleja, had been tossed out of the bar earlier and then threatened to return.

Investigators say the Castillejas then went and waited near a convenience store for the bar to close and people to come out.

They say the man then went back and began firing into the crowd.

EMS took the two people wounded by Castilleja to the hospital. Both are expected to recover.

Police arrested Desiree Castilleja and say she's now facing two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. They suspect she was to act as the getaway driver after the shootings.

The officer involved is a 20-year veteran of the police force. He's now on administrative leave pending the outcome of an investigation.
