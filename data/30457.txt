ENCINITAS, Calif. (KGTV) -- Sheriff’s deputies responding to a suspicious person report in an Encinitas neighborhood Friday morning shot and killed a man after officials said he brandished a firearm.

The shooting took place shortly before 8 a.m. in the 1500 block of Eolus Avenue, according to the San Diego County Sheriff’s Department.

A sheriff’s official at the scene told ABC 10News two deputies were dispatched to the neighborhood after someone called to report a suspicious person.

The official said the man, later identified as Eric Scott Anderson, 40, pulled a gun out in the presence of the responding deputies, prompting the deputies to open fire.

The man was taken to the hospital, where he later died. “Deputies are aware of who this person is; they have dealt with him before," the department said.

It is unknown how many shots were fired by the two deputies.

According to sheriff’s officials, the department’s homicide detectives have taken over the investigation. Detectives recovered a handgun on a hillside between Eolus Avenue and Orpheus Avenue.

Some residents said they believe the man lived on the hillside.

Sherry Shippy, who lives near where the shooting happened, told ABC 10News, “I guess the guy who was staying up there was causing a problem. I don’t know the problem, but he was causing an extra problem, and the neighbor called the police.”
