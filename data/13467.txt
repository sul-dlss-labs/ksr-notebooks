It was unclear why the man ran from the officers, Stafford said.

He was identified by the Medical Examinerâ€™s Office Saturday morning as Carlos Elias Arias, 27, of San Diego.

San Diego police records show that Arias was arrested on Sept. 13, 2012 on suspicion of vandalism and carrying a concealed weapon. Court records were not immediately available to show the outcome of that case.
