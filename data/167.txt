Two police officers shot and killed a 34-year-old Santa Ana man late Monday after he threatened them with a semiautomatic pistol, authorities said.

One of the officers stopped a 1971 Datsun sedan heading east on Edinger Avenue near Greenville Street about 11 p.m.; he called for backup and a police sergeant arrived at the scene.

As the officers were talking to the driver, identified as Eric Scott Denny, police said he pulled out a semiautomatic pistol and threatened the officers, who then fired several times, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Raul Luna.

Police recovered the gun--loaded and cocked--on the street, Luna said. Officials did not release the officer’s names or the history of the gun.

The driver was treated at the scene and taken to Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Neither officer was injured, Luna said. Both are veterans of the force, with 13 and 28 years’ experience.

The Santa Ana police are investigating, as is the Orange County district attorney’s office and the Sheriff’s Department.
