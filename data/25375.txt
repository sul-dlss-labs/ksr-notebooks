According to the sheriff, on December 31st shortly after 10 p.m. the Webster County Telecommunications Center received a call of a domestic disturbance just outside the City of Fort Dodge.

A responding deputy saw a vehicle matching the description and attempted to stop the vehicle. The vehicle did not stop, and the driver attempted to avoid law enforcement agencies.

According to the sheriff, during the attempted stop, gun shots were fired from the suspect vehicle. Law enforcement at the scene returned gun fire.

The sheriff said the suspect’s vehicle drove out into a field at the southern part of Webster County and came to a stop.
