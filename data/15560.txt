A Yavapai County sheriff's deputy shot and killed a Prescott man Sunday night after the man pointed a gun at the deputy, according to officials.

A neighbor called police Sunday evening after talking to the individual's family member, who reported that the man had made several self-destructive threats while in possession of a firearm, Yavapai County Sheriff's Office spokesman Dwight D'Evelyn said.

Deputies arrived at the home in the 1200 block of Oxbow Drive, in Prescott, where a 51-year-old man pointed a handgun at the responding deputies, D'Evelyn said. One of the deputies, whose name has not been released, fired and struck the man in the chest.

The man was taken to a local hospital where he later died of his injuries. The deputy was not injured, D'Evelyn said.
