CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Two police officers serving in North Carolina’s largest city have been placed on administrative leave while the circumstances of a fatal shooting of an armed man outside a Walmart are investigated, authorities said on Saturday.

The State Bureau of Investigation is looking at Friday’s shooting by Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officers. The police department identified on Saturday the armed man who died as 23-year-old Derrell Lamar Raney.

According to a police news release, a security guard contracted by Walmart at an east Charlotte store told police officers shortly before 6 p.m. that a man pointed a firearm at him and that he also threatened to shoot officers if they responded.

Police Chief Johnny Jennings said officers found the subject in the parking lot, WCNC-TV reported. Officers perceived a “lethal threat” as they approached the man, according to the police statement

“When officers encountered the subject, he pointed a firearm at the officers,” Jennings said. “They did shoot and injured the individual.” Raney was pronounced dead at the hospital. Police said a firearm was recovered at the scene.

The officers involved in the shooting were identified by the department as James Longworth, who joined the agency in 2018, and Micah Edmunds, who was hired in 2016. It’s standard policy for officers to be placed on administrative leave when they discharge their weapon.
