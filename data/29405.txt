A police chase ended in a deadly crash this afternoon in Stephens County. According to the Georgia State Patrol, 35-year-old Christopher Scott Taylor of Martin was ejected and killed when the car he was driving ran off the road and overturned.

Georgia State Patrol Post 7 Commander SFC Donnie Sadler says Taylor was fleeing from a state trooper attempting a traffic stop when the fatal crash occurred.

According to Sadler, the trooper clocked a Volvo S40 traveling at a high rate of speed on GA 17 South in Stephens County around 1:21 p.m. Wednesday. When the trooper activated his emergency lights, the driver, later identified as Taylor, fled.

“The Volvo driver made a left turn onto S Yow Mill Road and traveled east at high speed, running other motorists off the roadway,” says Sadler. “The Volvo driver negotiated a curve when he lost control and veered off the roadway’s north shoulder.”

The collision is under investigation by GSP Post 7 in Toccoa and the GSP’s Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team. Officials say no other details are available at this time.
