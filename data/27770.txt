POPE COUNTY, Ark. – One man is dead after an officer-involved shooting in Pope County.

It happened on the 600 block of Hickey Mountain Loop in the London community.

State police say 53-year-old Glenn A. White has died at the scene being shot by a Pope County Deputy on Wednesday, March 25.

We talked with a family member who says he’s still in shock.

“Unbelievable, It’s really tough,” said Keith Whitney White’s brother-in-law.

This all happened around 5:15 p.m. when the Pope County Sheriff’s Office responded to a call about a suicidal person.

State Police say a deputy shot White after he approached the deputy with a knife.

Whitney said White recently lost his father and had a lot to drink. They took his keys from him and several knives he had.

He said things escalated when the deputy arrived.

“Everybody scattered when the cop got out. I was very afraid actually of possibly getting hit by fire,” said Whitney.

He says the deputy shot White four times, and the entire family witnessed it because they were all in the front yard, but now he’s questioning their actions.

“Plenty of time for them to have shot him with a taser, I saw a taser come out the holster, it was aimed at him and never fired,” said Whitney.

White’s body was taken to the state crime lab for an autopsy. Meanwhile Whitney describes the person White was.

“Glen was not a violent individual and he’d do anything for anybody that he could and I never dreamed in a million years that his life would end like this,” said Whitney.

This is still a very active investigation. The prosecuting attorney will then decide whether the use of deadly force by a law enforcement officer was consistent with the state laws.
