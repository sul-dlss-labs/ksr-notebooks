Authorities Wednesday released the identity of a man shot dead by a deputy outside a Riverside County courthouse in Temecula.

Michael Cookson, 48, died at the scene roughly half an hour after he was shot at 10:30 a.m., according to a press release from the Riverside County Sheriff Department. Law enforcement originally responded to the location, in a county complex at County Center Drive and Ynez Road, after receiving reports of Cookson being “verbally abusive” toward a family member, officials said.

Cookson failed to comply with a deputy’s orders, and was shot after brandishing a knife and moving toward the official in a “threatening manner.” Paramedics and law enforcement immediately rendered aid but Cookson died at the scene, the release states.

The deputy involved in the shooting was treated at a nearby hospital for injuries that were not life-threatening, authorities said. He was placed on administrative leave, which is standard following officer-involved shootings.
