Sunday's newspaper column mentioned a poem reader Jane Harrison had written about the body of a girl found in a vacant lot on Feb. 16. She had been shot, and went unidentified for 19 days, when her father saw a police sketch of the victim and came forward.

Harrison wrote "Lament" days before the girl's father identified her as Tyisha Brown. I quoted part of it on Sunday, in part to highlight a murder that didn't get much attention, and as a reminder that every killing matters.

It certainly mattered to Jane Harrison.

Wrap her close

in fabrics of unimaginable softness

and warmth -- royal colors

to enoble

a short and disposable life

that mostly hid in grays and grayer

Erase fixed sorrow from her features

captured with exactness

by the artist in the morgue



Summon music

befitting a lost princess

who lies in state

And since there are

no conceivable amends to make

for her severed young life

and all the bitter time she lies unknown

at least, at least

remember her



-- Janes Harrison, March 8, 2008



Five days later she had a name. Her killing remains unsolved.
