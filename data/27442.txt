An officer with the Denver Police Department will not face criminal charges after he reportedly shot and killed a gang member who was wanted for armed robbery and who held multiple people at gunpoint during a vehicle pursuit in January.

Police say the pursuit began when the Denver police gang unit tried to apprehend a man—identified as 19-year-old Dovion Perkins—on warrants for three armed robberies and a gun possession charge.

Perkins reportedly fled officers with a woman and child in his car, leading police on a pursuit that stretched nine miles through two counties before ending with the fatal shooting in Aurora.

Officers Eric Leon and Ronald Espinosa began pursuing Perkins and at the end of that pursuit Officer Leon shot and killed the subject who was pointing a gun at the responding officers.
