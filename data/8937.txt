Albert Valencia, a 32-year-old white man, died of cardiac arrest Friday, March 19, after police used a Taser on him during an altercation in the 10000 block of Blumont Road in South Gate, according to authorities.

Officers were called to an LA Fitness health club at Firestone Boulevard and Ryerson Avenue about 9 a.m. Patrons reported that a man was acting strangely and threatening people inside the gym, according to a statement from the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.

Upon arrival, officers attempted to stop Valencia, who was driving his car out of the parking lot. The officers reported that they saw Valencia brandish a knife as they approached him, the statement said.

Valencia stopped his vehicle at Almira and Blumont roads and fled into a yard, where officers became involved in a "physical altercation" with him and used a Taser, according to the statement.

Shortly afterward, Valencia became unresponsive, and officers performed CPR until the fire department arrived. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead at 10:03 a.m., according to coroner's records.
