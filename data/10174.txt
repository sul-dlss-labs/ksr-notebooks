A 30-year-old man was arrested this week and has been charged with murder in connection with a robbery last May that ended with police fatally shooting his alleged accomplice, officials said today.

The robbery and gunfight began about 1:30 a.m. on May 11, 2011, when two officers saw two men wearing hoodies enter a JJ Peppers Food Store at 3101 S. Union Ave. and one of the suspects jumped over the counter, FOP spokesman Pat Camden said at the time.

The two officers quickly entered the store and one of the suspects opened fire, Camden said. One officer returned fire, killing the suspect, he said. The other suspect ran to the back of the store, prompting a nearly five-hour standoff that ended when police found he had escaped out a rear door.

Police today said their investigation later determined the second suspect was Mario Jones, 30, of the 10000 block of South Normal Avenue, and they were able to obtain an arrest warrant.

Jones was arrested about 10:15 p.m. Tuesday on the 9500 block of South Halsted Street and faces charges of felony murder and armed robbery, according to a release from the police Office of News Affairs. He is scheduled for a bond hearing Friday.

The dead suspect was identified as Jeff Wilson, 30, also of the 10000 block of South Normal Avenue. He was on parole for attempted armed robbery and possession of a firearm case from 2005, according to Illinois Department of Corrections records. He died from a gunshot wound to the chest, the medical examiner's office found following an autopsy on May 11.

Wilson had been released from Big Muddy Correctional Center in October, 2010, according to records. Wilson previously had served time on carjacking and armed robbery charges.
