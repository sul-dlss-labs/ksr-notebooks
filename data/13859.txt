Teen Dead In Officer Involved Shooting

A teen is dead and a Pensacola Police officer is on paid administrative leave after an officer involved shooting about 5:30 near the intersection of 17th Avenue and Bayfront Parkway.

Officers reported William Goodman, 17, of Gulf Breeze driving a 2009 Corvette recklessly at a high rate of speed several times Tuesday morning prior to the incident. Goodman fled from officers at speeds nearing 100 mph, and officers twice cancelled pursuits.

Around 5:30 this morning, officers were able to block the vehicle Goodman was driving in an attempt to take him into custody at the intersection of 17th Avenue and Bayfront Parkway.

However, once boxed in, Goodman repeatedly rammed police vehicles in an attempt to escape. During this attempt, he ran over Sgt. Steve Bauerâ€™s right leg. At that point, Officer Chad Willhite fired into the vehicle and struck Goodman. Goodman was taken to a local hospital for treatment and died a short time later.

A handwritten note from Goodman to his parents was found at his home.

Bauer was treated and released from a local hospital.

Goodman was scheduled for a court appearance in late January 2014 related to a March 30 incident in Santa Rosa County where he was charged with one count of vehicular homicide

and one count of reckless driving resulting in serious injury.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is handling the investigation as is standard procedure.
