Leticia Donarski sat on the phone for 13 minutes with 911 Thursday night, asking deputies for help for her husband.

She told a dispatcher that he was had bipolar disorder, but wasn’t on his medication and was acting erratically.

When deputies arrived at their Deltona home, Daniel Donarski had a shotgun and pointed it toward him. The deputy opened fire and killed him, according to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office.

Donarski, 58, had gotten home from work about 6:40 p.m. when the incident started. She ran out of her home on Teather Avenue and called 911.

“He’s cussing up a storm and he’s punching some holes in the wall,” she told a dispatcher. “… He needs to be admitted …They need to Baker Act him.”

She told the dispatcher her husband was bipolar and his doctor was weaning him off of one medication to start a new prescription.

“He’s got a chemical imbalance,” she said.

After arriving, deputies walked up to the front door and called for him to come out. Then one of the deputies, Shawn Adkins, heard the sound of a shotgun being loaded and backed away, Sheriff’s Office spokesman Andrew Gant said.

That’s when Daniel Donarski came out with the gun and pointed it at Adkins, he said.

Adkins yelled for Donarski to drop the shotgun. He did not and Adkins was forced to open fire, Gant said.

Donarski was killed.

Adkins, 25, has been with the department since October 2015. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement will investigate, which is standard in deputy-involved shootings.

He will be placed on paid leave during the investigation.
