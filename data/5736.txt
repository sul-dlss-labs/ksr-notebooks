Incident at 7402 Calhoun #149 December 17, 2006 -- A knife-wielding suspect who charged at two Houston police officers was fatally shot by the officers at 7402 Calhoun #149 about 5:25 p.m. on Friday (December 15). The suspect, identified as James Edward Smith (b/m, DOB 10-25-55), of 7402 Calhoun #149, sustained two gunshot wounds and was pronounced dead at Memorial Hermann Hospital. The two HPD officers, Sergeant K.D. Anthony, sworn in as an officer in May 2001, and Officer W.E. Reiser, sworn in as an officer in March 1995, were not injured. Both are assigned to the Southeast Patrol Division. HPD Homicide Division Sergeant N.T. Ruland and Officers A. Mares and K.P. Carr

reported: An off-duty HPD officer working a security job at the above location was advised of a possible disturbance in apartment #149. After knocking on the door, the officer heard a female's voice telling him to come inside and then a male warning him that if he did, he would be killed. The officer backed away and called for backup. Patrol officers and a sergeant arrived a short time later and spoke to the male and female. The officers heard the female say the male wanted to kill himself and then she started begging for the male not to stab her. Officers forced entry into the apartment and found the male standing over the female with a knife poised over her head. They gave the

suspect verbal commands to drop the knife, but he refused and charged at the officers with the knife still in his hand. The sergeant and one officer discharged their weapons one time each, striking Smith in the chest and abdomen. As in all officer-involved shootings in the city limits, the HPD Homicide and Internal Affairs Divisions and the Harris County District Attorney's office are investigating this case. GO/JFC 12-17-06
