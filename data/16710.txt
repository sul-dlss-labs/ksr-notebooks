AKRON, Ohio -- The robbery suspect shot and killed Friday by an Akron police officer was on probation for a 2013 armed robbery.

William Lemmon, 21, was released from prison on Feb. 12 on the aggravated robbery conviction and placed on two years of probation.

Lemmon and another man on Friday robbed the Bista Brother Asian grocery store, police said. They stole a purse and left. Akron police officers followed Lemmon's bicycle behind a group of businesses on North Main Street.

Lemmon refused the officer's orders to take his hand away from his waistband, police said. A witness also said that Lemmon told the officers to shoot him.

The officer, an 18-year veteran officer, is on paid leave while the shooting is investigated.

The other robber has not been identified.

Akron police officials said they are investigating the possibility that Lemmon and the other man are responsible for at least two other armed robberies in the North Hill neighborhood.

Lemmon has several misdemeanor convictions and one felony conviction on his criminal record.

Lemmon walked into Church's Chicken in March 2013 the 1200 block of South Main Street. He pulled a fake handgun from his backpack and demanded money from the store's safe.

He jumped over the counter and tried to open the safe by himself, but wasn't able to open it. Lemmon then ran out of the store without stealing anything.

Lemmon eventually pleaded guilty to robbery and was sentenced in 2014 to four years in prison.

Summit County Common Pleas Judge Alison McCarty granted Lemmon's release from prison and allowed him to enter the re-entry program. Lemmon was ordered to live at a halfway house and abide by other stipulations, including submitting to random drug tests.
