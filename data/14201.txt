A 52-year-old man was shot and killed early Monday in an incident with Forsyth County sheriff’s deputies.

Forsyth sheriff’s spokesman Doug Rainwater said deputies just after midnight responded to a routine 911 call from a home in the 7900 block of Nicholson Road in northwest Forsyth County.

“A man at the residence threatened deputies with a firearm and was shot,” Rainwater said in an e-mail. “He died at the scene.”

The man was identified Monday afternoon as Kenny Roger Drake, GBI spokeswoman Sherry Lang said. The GBI is investigating the shooting, which is protocol since it involves deputies.

No deputies were injured in the incident. Three deputies, whose names were not released, were placed on routine administrative leave with pay.

No additional details were released regarding the initial 911 call or the shooting.
