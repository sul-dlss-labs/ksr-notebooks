SEMINOLE COUNTY, Fla. (WESH)– The Seminole County Sheriff’s Office says that in the hours before Deputy Daniel Carrero murdered his girlfriend and then killed himself, he used equipment at the sheriff’s office to get information from his girlfriend’s cell phone.

Carrero, a 16-year veteran of the sheriff’s office, shot and killed his girlfriend Mistie Reynolds, 33, in Kissimmee on Aug. 12, authorities said.

The sheriff’s office said that on the day of the murder-suicide, Carrero violated the agency’s vehicle use policy and used agency equipment to view the contents of Reynolds’ phone.

Reynolds’ boss said that on the day she was murdered, Reynolds was moving out of the apartment she shared with Carrero.

According to investigative documents, surveillance video shows that after Reynolds had signed a lease on a new apartment in Kissimmee, she parked behind the Speedway gas station on U.S. 192. A few minutes later, Carrero, who was driving an unmarked Seminole County sheriff’s car, pulled up next to her.

They were both found inside Reynold’s car by a store clerk.

According to the sheriff’s office, some of Carrero’s co-workers knew he was having relationship troubles, but they claim there was no sign he was capable of murder.

Carrero specialized in electronic surveillance for the sheriff’s office, investigators said.

“We are thoroughly reviewing policies and procedures for the Digital Evidence Unit, and will implement any additional safeguards needed to prevent the possibility of future misuse,” the sheriff’s office said.

Investigators said the gun Carerro used in the murder suicide was his personal handgun and not one issued by the Seminole County Sheriff’s Office.
