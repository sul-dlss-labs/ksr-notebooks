After a three-month internal investigation, an Ypsilanti Police officer who shot and killed a drug suspect during an undercover buy has returned to duty.

A report found that the actions of Officer Uriah Hamilton were "reasonable and justified" and he has returned to LAWNET, the Livingston and Washtenaw Narcotics Enforcement Team, said Ypsilanti Police Chief Matt Harshberger.

Hamilton was also cleared of any criminal wrongdoing by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor in February.

According to testimony in the criminal case against another suspect, Hamilton arranged a "buy-bust" operation targeting known dealer David Antjuan Ware, 29, last Jan. 23. When officers moved in to make arrests of Ware and another man sitting in a car, the driver tried to speed away and a LAWNET officer fired three shots at the car as he dove out of the car's path.

Ware ran from the car with Hamilton in pursuit. Ware was shot by Hamilton when he stopped and turned around with his hand in his waistband as if reaching for a gun, police said.

Police found no gun in Ware's hand or waistband - only the money LAWNET had just given him for the cocaine.
