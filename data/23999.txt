GUTHRIE â€” Guthrie police on Monday released video of an officer shooting a man who was threatening his ex-girlfriend with a large hunting knife.

Jason Alan Birt, 27, died after the March 31 shooting, Police Chief Don Sweger said.

Officer Caleb Pinley was searching for a reported reckless driver nearby when he happened upon Birt standing over his ex-girlfriend with a large hunting knife, Sweger said.

The video shows Pinley ordering Birt to drop the weapon. Instead, Birt leans over the ex-girlfriend with the knife in his hand, and Pinley shoots him, the video shows.

After Pinley removed the knife from Birt's hand, he and another officer attempted unsuccessfully to revive Birt, Sweger said.

Pinley, who was hired by the department in Nov. 2015, has been cleared from the district attorney's office and returned to work, Sweger said.

Birt was charged in September 2017 with domestic assault and battery, first-degree burglary, interfering with an emergency call, and actual physical control of a vehicle while intoxicated, Logan County court records show.

The victim in the September 2017 incident was the one threatened with the knife in March, Sweger said.
