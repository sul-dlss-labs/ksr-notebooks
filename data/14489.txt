A suspected gunman was fatally shot by police and three other people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds early Monday.

UNIVERSAL CITY, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A suspected gunman was fatally shot by police at Universal CityWalk and three other people were hospitalized with gunshot wounds early Monday morning.

The shooting happened on the main walkway near Infusion Lounge.

According to LAPD Sgt. Barry Montgomery, police officers and sheriff's deputies responded to a report of a group disturbance around 1:15 a.m. When they arrived, they heard shots fired from the crowd and took cover. As they took cover, they saw a suspect armed with a handgun in the crowd, and an officer-involved shooting occurred.

The suspect was identified as James Renee White Jr., 21.

L.A. County Fire pronounced the suspect dead at the scene, Montgomery said. Several people were injured as they tried to escape. One person was transported to a hospital with trauma injuries, and two others were transported with serious injuries, according to the L.A. County Fire Dept. Others suffered minor injuries.

No law enforcement personnel were injured.

One witness captured the frantic scene on cellphone video. Another witness said a DJ competition was taking place when a fight broke out.

"I want to say it was an altercation upstairs in the 21-plus room, and then from there it was fights everywhere," a witness said.

"It was multiple shots fired, more than three. I heard more than two different type of handguns," a witness identified as DJ Phillip said.

A gun was recovered at the scene, investigators said.
