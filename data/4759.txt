A man who was being sought by homicide investigators in South Carolina shot himself in Le Mars.

Cops say it began when 44-year-old Randall Mohning went to the home of the former girlfriend, who had a restraining order against him. Authorities who found 33-year-old Stacy Vos shot and wounded and their 1-year-old child missing from her home notified LeMars Police Chief Stuart Dekkenga that Mohning was in LeMars. The chief says officers found him near the home of an ex-wife there.

Dekkenga says Mohning showed a weapon, there was a short foot chase , officers ordered him to drop his gun, and he he shot himself. Mohning was dead at the scene. Vos was taken from her home in Hinton to a Sioux City hospital, where they’re not giving information about her condition.

Police say Mohning had left the baby with his ex-wife at her home in LeMars, where the child was found unharmed. Authorities in South Carolina has been searching for Mohning after the boyfriend of a woman he’d dated there was shot and killed outside a Charleston restaurant last Thursday.
