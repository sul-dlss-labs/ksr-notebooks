Waukesha County's district attorney says a police officer's use of deadly force was warranted because the armed suspect who died was a threat and aggressively encouraged the officer to shoot him.

Officer Bradley Condon killed 54-year-old Ted Schmitz after confronting the burglary and forgery suspect in Waukesha on Feb. 10. An investigative report released Wednesday says Schmitz threatened the officer with two knives. And the officer, fearful that Schmitz would attack him or try to grab his gun, shot Schmitz in the chest after the suspect ignored his commands.

The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports District Attorney Sue Opper said any reasonable person would have concluded there was imminent danger of death or great bodily harm.
