An armed man fatally shot by Waukegan police in the lobby of a hotel was a former U.S. Marine who was once wounded by an IED and had threatened suicide in the past, police said today.



John D. Corcoran, 33, had served as a U.S. Marine during multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a release from Waukegan police.



Corcoran was honorably discharged in 2009 after being wounded by an Improvised Explosive Device.



Most recently, he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and had threatened suicide in the past, the release said.



Officers encountered an armed suicidal subject later identified as Corcoran about 8:30 p.m. Wednesday in the lobby of the Holiday Inn Express, 611 Lakehurst Rd. in the far northern suburb, according to the release.



Corcoran was pointing what appeared to be a handgun, equipped with a laser sighting system, at a male victim who was lying face down at Corcoran's feet, the release said.



Police evacuated a female customer from the front counter area and approached Corcoran while yelling commands and identifying themselves as police, the release said.



When Corcoran directed his weapon at the officers, one of them fired and struck Corcoran in the upper torso.



The male on the ground ran from the scene unharmed while officers and paramedics rendered first aid to Corcoran, who died at the scene, the release said.



Corcoran was of Waukegan, according to Lake County Coroner Artis Yancey.



No police officers were injured.



Authorities determined the gun Corcoran was using was a replica pellet gun fitted with an authentic laser sighting system, the release said.



The Lake County Major Crimes Task Force is leading the investigation into the shooting.
