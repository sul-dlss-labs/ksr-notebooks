Police released a statement regarding the deadly encounter Monday morning, saying they were in the area searching for Vincent Harris, who was wanted on charges related to a violent attack involving a machete which sent his girlfriend to the hospital.

During their search, police said Harris pointed a weapon at officers from inside an apartment, prompting them to open fire. The department released a portion of the body cam video from the encounter which appeared to show Harris pointing a firearm at police from inside the apartment.

According to authorities, four officers have been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation. This is in harmony with standard procedure following an officer-involved shooting.

The incident also resulted in the injury of a BRPD K-9. The injured K-9 was taken to the LSU School of Veterinary Medicine for treatment and is reportedly in stable condition.
