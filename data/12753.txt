LEESBURG, Fla. â€” Leesburg police have released more details on an officer-involved shooting that left one man dead Tuesday.



Carlos Oquendo, 23, was shot and killed following an attempted traffic stop in the area of Lucerne Circle and Euclid Street around 11 a.m. Tuesday.



According to police, Leesburg police officers James Dunagan and Gustavo Escalante were attempting to stop a Toyota driven by Oquendo when Oquendo began driving in an evasive fashion.



Police said when Oquendo turned onto Lucerne Circle, a street with no outlet, and stopped, the officers stepped from their vehicles and ordered Oquendo to get out of his car.



According to police, Oquendo put his car in reverse and drove rapidly toward Dunagan. His car hit a tree and then struck Escalante's patrol car.



Police said that Dunagan then fired his department issued firearm at Oquendo, hitting him at least once.

The two officers then called for Lake County Emergency Management Services and began performing first aid on Oquendo.

Oquendo was taken by helicopter to Orlando Regional Medical Center where he died.

Police did not confirm witnesses' statements to Channel 9 that Oquendo shot at the officers.



Dunagan has been with the Leesburg Police Department since 1996 and Escalante joined the force in 2010.



The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating the shooting.
