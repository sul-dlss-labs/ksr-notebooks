UPDATE: Deputy who shot at bank robbery suspect identified as 18-year sheriff's office veteran

Authorities have identified a man who died after he was shot at by a Clark County sheriff's deputy Monday afternoon.

Kenneth Allen Pointer, 43, of Portland, was taken to a hospital where he died, said Kim Kapp, a Vancouver Police Department spokeswoman. She did not say whether the deputy shot him or whether Pointer was armed.

In a news release, Kapp said the Clark County Medical Examiner's Office will release information about Pointer's cause and manner of death. The Regional Major Crimes Team is investigating.

About 2 p.m. Monday, Vancouver police received an alarm call from the U.S. Bank at 1607 Main St., Kapp said. The suspect, whom police identified as Pointer, made off with an undisclosed amount of cash that had a tracking device with it, she said.

Vancouver police, Washington State Patrol and Clark County sheriff's officers tracked Pointer. A sheriff's deputy performed a "pit maneuver" -- a technique used to stop his car -- and the shooting happened shortly after 2:15 p.m. at Northeast 10th Avenue and 219th Street, more than 10 miles from the bank.

No specific details were released about what prompted the shooting.

On Monday, Kapp said she didn't know whether the deputy's gunfire hit the man. The deputy has not been identified.

This story will be updated as more information becomes available.
