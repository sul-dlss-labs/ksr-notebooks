CAMANO ISLAND – A teenage boy apparently killed himself in front of Island and Snohomish county sheriff’s deputies Monday, despite police efforts to stop the suicide.

The incident prompted Island County Sheriff Mark Brown to ask for a Snohomish Multi-Agency Response Team investigation because deputies from two agencies participated in the incident, Everett police Sgt. Robert Goetz said.

Typically the special team, made up of officials from several Snohomish County jurisdictions, is called on when officers are involved in a shooting.

Deputies did not use their guns Monday, Goetz said.

Police were called at about 10 a.m. to a home in the 800 block of Margie Ann Drive near Driftwood Shores for reports of a suicidal man, Goetz said.

A Snohomish County sheriff’s deputy, on scene to help Island County deputies, used an electronic stun gun to try to stop the teenager, but was unsuccessful.

The 16-year-old boy shot himself with a rifle in front of deputies, Goetz said.

The boy’s name and other details were not released.

It is “somewhat unusual” to have a suicide at this age, Goetz said. Monday’s incident remains under investigation.

Snohomish County sheriff’s deputies and north Snohomish County fire fighters and medics often provide assistance on Camano Island.

It can be take up to an hour for emergency personnel on Whidbey Island to travel to Camano Island, while police and fire from Snohomish County can be on Camano in minutes.
