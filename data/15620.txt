Crime & Safety UPDATE: Murder-Suicide Victim Was Dog-Groomer, Baker; Services Planned Services scheduled for Christina Prestianni, who was allegedly shot and killed by her boyfriend, a state corrections officer. Reply

The victim in what authorities are calling a murder-suicide had a very peaceful job: Dog-grooming and pet-treat baking.

Christina Prestianni, 37, a Bloomfield High School graduate, was owner and operator of a local bakery in the Caldwell area, according to her Facebook page. A preliminary investigation revealed that Christopher Minichini, 38, shot his girlfriend and then turned the gun on himself, Acting Essex County Prosecutor Carolyn Murray said. The two were found dead on Thursday in the Hillside Avenue home they shared.

Minchini worked as a New Jersey State Corrections Officer for the past seven years, Murray reported. Services for Prestinanni will be held on Tuesday, 4 to 8 p.m. at the Zarro Funeral Home, at 145 Harrison at Bloomfield.

Family and friends of Prestinanni are seeking donations to cover the cost of funeral expenses. As of Friday afternoon, $3,200 had been raised on a Gofundme page that was set up for Christina Prestianni by her ex-husband of five years.

Friends posting on Prestianni’s Facebook page stated that the young woman’s sudden death is an “insurmountable loss.” Many described Prestianni as “smart, funny, charismatic, energetic” and a “wonderful person.” Others remembered her love for animals, with one Facebook friend stating, “This makes no sense. We have lost a truly beautiful human being. Your smile and your sweetness will never be forgotten by all, whether we have two legs, or four. Rest In Peace.”
