The man charged with the hit-and-run death of a 4-year-old girl had minutes earlier been pursued by a company police officer for reckless driving, according to Reidsville police.

Capt. Dan Huber with the Reidsville Police Department said investigators don't believe the private officer's pursuit played a role in the accident Tuesday night.An officer with Triton Company Police saw a car, believed to be driven by Marcus Jermaine Walters, speed into a cul-de-sac at Womack Apartments, said Triton Chief Mel Downing.

Triton is contracted to provide security for the apartments.

The officer, Kenneth Heckstall, estimated the car was going 45 mph in the 30 mph zone, and almost hit a child, Downing said.

The officer pursued the car and, using a siren and blue lights on his unmarked car, pulled Walters over on Third Street, about two blocks from the cul-de-sac. But, when the officer approached Walters' car, he drove off, Reidsville police said.

The officer got back in his car and pursued Walters onto Vance Street, but lost sight of the car past the intersection of Vance and West Harrison Street.

"By the time the officer got to Vance and West Harrison, the vehicle was several blocks ahead of him," Huber said.

"It was never a vehicle chase, per se," Downing said. "The officer initiated a vehicle stop. The suspect sped off. The officer never really gained ground on the vehicle and lost him subsequently."

Downing said the officer was doing the speed limit during the pursuit, in accordance with the company's 'no chase' policy, and that no policies were violated.

Huber, with the Reidsville police, said he didn't believe the private officer "got up to much speed at all."

The entire pursuit covered a half mile.

Downing said the driver didn't slow down when going over four speed bumps.

The pursuit ended. Then, minutes later, Walters was traveling east on Lawsonville Avenue when he struck a turning truck, bounced off a rock wall and plowed into a trio of girls walking to a friend's house, according to Reidsville police.

LaKenya Winchester, 4, died of injuries from the crash.

The accident occurred about a mile and half from the intersection where the chase ended.

Walters was arrested five hours later, charged with involuntary manslaughter and held in the county jail with a $500,000 secured bond.

Walters blew a zero on a field alcohol test, Huber said Thursday.

Local police don't believe the chase played a role in the fatal accident, Huber said.

"The pursuit had been cut off," he said.

Walters "wouldn't have seen any police officer in the rear-view mirror or anything. He would have continued at his own initiative at whatever speed he was going."

Company police, such as those employed by Triton, differ from private security guards in that they are sworn officers in North Carolina.

"They meet all the requirements of municipal officers," said Michael Tellekamp, regional manger of Corporate Security International in Greensboro.

But, "instead of being sworn in by a local agency, their lawful authority comes from the (state) attorney general."

Huber said that company police "have all the powers of arrest, just as every officer would while they are policing the area they are authorized to police."

Company police can also follow a suspect off the property they are charged to protect if that believe that person committed a crime, Huber said.

Tellekamp agreed.

"If they have a reason to arrest you or stop your vehicle and you refuse to stop and take off ... that company police officer has the power to pursue you," he said.
