SAN DIEGO (CNS) - On Saturday, San Diego police identified the man who reportedly was wielding a knife early Thursday in an alley behind an adult book store in the Midway District.

Fridoon Zalbeg Rawshannehad, 42, had threatened people in the 3200 block of Hancock Street near West Camino del Rio around 12:05 a.m. Thursday, San Diego police Lt. Mike Hastings said.

An employee of the Highlight Book Store called for help, as Rawshannehad then entered the business and threatened the worker before heading back outside.

An arriving officer spotted Rawshannehad behind the building and told him to drop his weapon. Wielding a knife, Rawshannehad charged at the officer, prompting him to open fire, according to Hastings.

Rawshannehad was taken to a hospital but later died, Hastings said.
