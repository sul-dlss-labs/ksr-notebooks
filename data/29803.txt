Yonkers police: Standoff ends after man found dead with apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound

A man who barricaded himself after firing at officers in Yonkers was found dead with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, police say.

Authorities say the 50-year-old man, who they described as emotionally disturbed, was inside the home at 11 Livingston St.

Police say it began as a welfare check, just around 10:45 a.m., but quickly took a violent turn when they were met with gunfire from the man inside. They say the officers fired back and the man ran inside, beginning the hours long standoff.

Deputy Chief Joseph Molinaro says, "At approximately 6:40 p.m., they located a male on the floor, a semiautomatic rifle was next to him, he died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. We are continuing the investigation and collecting evidence from the front of the house."

No police were injured in the gunfire.

The family dog, who was inside the house, was found safe.
