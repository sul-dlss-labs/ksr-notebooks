GLENDALE (AP) â€” A 38-year-old man who was allegedly impaired by some substance died after being stunned with a stun gun as officers tried to take him into custody.

Glendale police said Olsen Ogoddide was found sitting in the back seat of a car on Friday night. The driver didn't know Ogoddide and asked an officer for help.

Two officers asked the man to get out of the car, but Ogoddide ignored them and resisted efforts to place him under arrest, said Officer Michael Pena in a written release.

Officers twice used a Taser stun gun on Ogoddide as he resisted arrest, police said.

Medical personnel were called because officers believed he was under the influence of some substance. When they arrived, they had to restrain Ogoddide to treat him, Pena said.

At the hospital, Ogoddide vomited and went into a seizure. He was pronounced dead in the emergency room.
