St. Louis â€“ St. Louis County police have identified the man who shot and killed firefighter Leonard Riggins before the suspect himself was killed by police.

Riggins was 52 years old and a veteran city firefighter. On Wednesday, he pulled over to help at a crash scene in north St. Louis County.

Police say the crash victim turned out to be 19-year-old Christopher Brandon of St. Louis, who had just carjacked a vehicle.

Brandon shot Riggins, then drove away in Riggins' fire department car. St. Louis County police spotted the suspect minutes later.

The suspect took off on foot and pointed a gun at officers who fired back, killing Brandon.

This was the fifth time this year an emergency responder in the St. Louis region has been killed in the line of duty.
