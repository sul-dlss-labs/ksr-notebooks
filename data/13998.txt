ORANGE COUNTY, Fla. â€” Florida Highway Patrol troopers have identifed the man killed in a crash on John Young Parkway Sunday evening.

Alex Gomez-Guerrero, 20, sped away from an Orlando police officer just moments before he was killed in the crash, according to authorities.

The police officer approached Gomez-Guerrero's vehicle because it was stopped in a turn lane at John Young Parkway and I-4 around 6:30 p.m. Police said he then took off when the officer asked him to get out of his vehicle.

FHP troopers said Gomez-Guerrero, who was from Mascotte, was driving southbound on John Young Parkway when he crashed into the back of a minivan. He was not being chased by officers at the time of the crash, officials said.

Troopers said the Gomez-Guerrero's vehicle overturned.

According to troopers the minivan caught fire, but the fire was quickly extinguished by an OPD officer.

The five occupants of the minivan had minor injuries.

John Young Parkway was shut down in both directions while the Florida Highway Patrol investigated.
