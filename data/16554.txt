Richard Francis Compo Jr. allegedly fired seven shots at officers in his home before walking outside with a rifle in his hands and allegedly raising it toward police.

An officer and a sergeant each returned fire one time, killing the 36-year-old.

Officers were responding to a domestic violence at Compo's home at the time of the shooting. Compo's wife had called police saying her husband was acting violently and had threatened to kill her. She had fled their home and asked for help at a nearby church.

Police say Compo was suicidal after accidentally shooting a friend while camping the day before.

The officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave until an investigation is completed.
