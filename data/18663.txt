MIAMI, Okla. — A man suspected of several car thefts and home break-ins in the Ottawa County area was shot and killed by deputies Saturday afternoon after he allegedly pointed a handgun at them.

Travis Edward Baker, 42, was killed about 4 p.m. after a vehicle pursuit that led law enforcement to rural Fairland. Baker abandoned a vehicle and fled on foot into a wooded area, according to a news release from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.

Ottawa County Sheriff’s Office deputies followed him into the woods, and he was shot after he reportedly pointed a gun at law enforcement officers, the release states.

Deputies had been pursuing Baker in connection with a series of automobile thefts and burglaries, the release states.

Baker died at the scene. The name of the deputy who fired the fatal shot wasn’t released.

Baker had been convicted of numerous felonies, including drug possession, burglary and knowingly concealing stolen property. He was released from Department of Corrections custody in 2011, according to online records.

OSBI agents are investigating the shooting. The county’s District Attorney’s Office will determine whether it was justified.
