A 68-year-old Corona man has been identified as the suspect with a rifle who was fatally shot by Corona police earlier this month when they said he raised the weapon at them during a standoff.

Delson Silva died at the scene of the confrontation in the 2600 block of Tundar Circle the night of Nov. 6, the Riverside County Coronerâ€™s office said late Wednesday.

Corona police were called to the address at 8:35 p.m. to respond to a suspected domestic violence incident.

Neighbors initially reported possible gunshots, then followed with more calls about a wounded woman and a man with a gun.

Police went to the home with an armored rescue vehicle and spoke to the suspect. It was during that time that the man was fatally shot by officers, a police statement said.

Officers said they found the woman outside the home upon their arrival, and that she had already been critically wounded. She was awake and her condition was improving, Detective Jason Waldon said Thursday.
