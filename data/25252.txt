The passenger in a car that crashed as part of a high-speed chase earlier this month has died. 44-year-old Juan Palacios was in a car driven by 33-year-old Matthew Stuard of Mount Blanchard when Stuard attempted to run from police on November 10. Stuard died at the scene of the crash.

A State Highway Patrol trooper tried to pull Stuard over for speeding on West Main Cross Street. He sped away, eventually hitting two utility poles near the intersection of Blanchard and Fremont avenues. The crash caused the car to catch fire.
