WRIGHT COUNTY, MN — Authorities say a Big Lake man killed his girlfriend’s son, resulting in a police chase by the Wright County police department, early March 28. Less than two hours later, the man committed suicide, the Star Tribune reported.

After Peter Tek reportedly shot Savang Sath twice, Wright County deputies spotted Tek pumping gas at a Holiday station in Monticello. When he saw the deputies approach, he got into the Lincoln, and headed toward I-94 in Monticello with the deputies chasing him.

Racing down Interstate 94 near St. Cloud in the early morning hours, his injured girlfriend held hostage in the car, Tek made a final phone call.

He told his ex-wife that he had killed his girlfriend’s son and implied to his son, Phath Bauer, that he was going to kill himself.

Less than two hours later, still sitting in the Lincoln Navigator parked alongside the barricaded freeway, Tek released his girlfriend, shot himself in the head and died.

According to Tek’s brother, Cheth Tek, Peter Tek and his girlfriend attended a party and got home at about 2 a.m. on Saturday. An argument ensued between Tek and Sath and Tek shot Sath twice. Authorities said that Tek killed Sath, 27, at the family’s home at 1010 Eagle Lake Rd. in Big Lake. He shot himself near where Stearns County Rd. 6 crosses I-94 at about 5:40 a.m.

A 2-mile stretch of the freeway near the standoff scene was closed and traffic detoured for about two hours, police reported.
