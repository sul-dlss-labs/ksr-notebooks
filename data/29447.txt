CHESANING, MI — A police-involved shooting has resulted in the death of a Chesaning man.

About 6:20 a.m. on Thursday, Jan. 7, members of the Michigan State Police Emergency Support Team were serving a high-risk search warrant on a home in the 400 block of East Broad Street. The EST was serving the warrant on behalf of the Bay Area Narcotics Enforcement Team, or BAYANET, according to MSP.

A preliminary investigation indicates as EST members approached the front of the residence, a man confronted them with a gun, police said.

Members of the EST fired their weapons at him in response.

Shortly thereafter, police found the 40-year-old Chesaning man deceased inside the residence. Police safely removed a female resident from the home.

Neither the woman nor police personnel were injured, according to police.

Detectives from the MSP Second District Investigative Response Team are investigating the shooting. EST members who were involved have been placed on administrative leave, per department protocol, while the investigation is underway.

Additional details were not immediately available.

The man’s death is the second to result from gunfire in Saginaw County so far this year. The first was that of Jamel J. Lynn, 22, found shot to death in a vehicle in the area of Wilkins and Elsie streets in Spaulding Township on the night of Jan. 5.
