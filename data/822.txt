A man who wrestled a gun from a California Highway Patrol officer in San Dimas on Wednesday morning fled to Forest Lawn cemetery and killed himself with the weapon, authorities said.

The officer responded to a report about 8:25 a.m. of a possibly intoxicated motorist in a disabled vehicle on the Via Verde onramp to the eastbound San Bernardino Freeway, said CHP Officer Bill Preciado.

The man and the female officer struggled and a shot was fired, Preciado said. No one was hit, but the officer suffered minor injuries in the scuffle.

The man, identified as Ira Michael Perry, 30, ran down the onramp to Forest Lawn and the central court of the cemetery, where he shot himself, Preciado said.
