ST. JOHNS â€” Police have released the identity of the man who died after striking a semi truck during a police pursuit in St. Johns Tuesday.

The man, Israel Dealmeida, 38, of St. Johns, fled a traffic stop after police tried to pull him over on Business U.S. 127 near Taft Road in Bingham Township, Clinton County Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Clarke said.

Dealmeida had outstanding felony warrants and posed an "imminent threat to himself and others," Clarke said.

After the two minute pursuit, where police unsuccessfully attempted to use stop sticks, Dealmeida struck the back of the semi, Clarke said. Several witnesses said they believed Dealmeida had time to go around the truck, but instead increased speed and drove straight into the back of it.

St. John's Police Chief David Kirk said crews on the scene were having trouble getting the vehicle out from under the semi. Dealmeida's vehicle was wedged two-thirds of the way under the trailer of the semi. There was a large amount of debris on the roadway behind the vehicle.

Dealmeida was charged in Clinton County District Court in December with five felonies, including possession of a weapon while under the influence; discharging a firearm at a building; importing, manufacturing and storing explosives; and handling explosives while under the influence.

Business 127 was closed between Townsend and Sunview for several hours Tuesday afternoon.

The semi driver was not injured.
