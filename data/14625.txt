A man who led police in a pursuit Monday night was shot by officers and later died at a hospital, Oklahoma City police reported.

The pursuit began about 8 p.m. after a man at a Dollar General store near Warr Acres had reported his vehicle was being stolen and he was following the vehicle, Oklahoma City police Capt. Dexter Nelson said.

Warr Acres police began pursuing the stolen vehicle near NW 45 and Ann Arbor Avenue. Oklahoma City police joined the pursuit near NW 50 and Meridian Avenue. The chase ended near NW 61 and Quapah Avenue, Nelson said.

Officers reported the man got out of the vehicle and would not respond to police instructions. The officers used Tasers and bean bag guns in an attempt to subdue him, but the man turned around and approached officers brandishing a large fixed-blade knife.

That’s when the officers fired their guns, Nelson said.

The man, whose name was not released Monday, was taken to a nearby hospital where he died, Nelson said.

Blue sheets were laid out in the NW 61 and Quapah Avenue intersection as crime scene investigators compiled evidence Monday night.

Area residents said they thought someone was shooting off firecrackers, but then realized it was gunfire.

Angie Slover, a North Coronado Heights resident, said she initially thought a vehicle had crashed into a house or the retaining wall near the intersection.

“I really didn’t dream, until I heard the gunfire, of what was going on,” Slover said. “It’s scary because nothing like this happens. I can see someone wrecking but not this.”

Nelson said he did not know how many shots were fired, how many officers fired their weapons, or for which city the officers worked.

He said Oklahoma City police will be investigating since the incident occurred in Oklahoma City.
