The Buffalo Wild Wings in Macomb will be holding a fundraiser for the Lewistown Marching Indians Band from 11 a.m. Wednesday to 1 a.m. Thursday.

BWW will donate 10 percent of all sales excluding alcohol and taxes back to the Lewistown Jr High and High School Marching Band.

There is a voucher that will need to be given to the server for them to count the sale towards the fundraiser.

The Marching Indians have had a successful fall. Under the direction of Justin Haynes, the 50-member band has received First Place Band in the Canton Friendship Festival Parade; First Place Band at Beardstown Fall Fun Festival and First Place Drum Major Award; First Place Band at Mac-Murray (Jacksonville) Homecoming Parade and First Place Drumline; and Second Place Class A Band, First Place Class A Drumline and First Place Drum Major at the Western Illinois University 2015 Fall Classic.

The band will take their show on the road in June of 2016, with four performances in New Orleans, La. The Buffalo Wild Wings “Eat Wings. Raise Funds” will help make that trip possible. Obtain a voucher or more information at by emailing Elaine at ejstone68@yahoo.com.
