A Hodgenville man was shot to death by police and questions remain about how he was killed.App users: Tap here to watch the videoTwo Hodgenville police officers arrived at an apartment to serve a warrant for disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing on the man living there at 2 a.m. Sunday.The wanted man, 59-year-old Benjamin Burba, answered the door. Police said Burba started a fight and when he grabbed what appeared to be a rifle, the officers shot him."They went through the door and shot him," said witness James Waddell."How many times?" asked WLKY's Jessica Oh."Five times," Waddell replied.It was later determined, Burba was holding a B.B. gun.His friends are stunned."It's just very cruel," said friend Rosanna Williams. "To shoot him several times, I wouldn't even do an animal that way."Their argument centers around the fact that the warrant was served in the middle of the night.Kentucky State Police said the timing was strategic."A lot of times, whenever you know that it's possible that there's going to be a confrontation, it's good to go late in the evening, or maybe even earlier in the morning somewhat trying to catch somebody off guard and maybe make it a little safer for the officers," said KSP Trooper Jeff Gregory.Burba may have grabbed a B.B. gun, which isn't as dangerous as a rifle, but police said decisions are made quickly in the heat of the moment."It's hard to discern exactly what kind of rifle it is," Gregory said.Friends said Burba was a manic depressive, who had gone off his medication."Made him a very aggressive person, antagonistic, totally different personality, almost schizophrenic type," said friend Jim Weiland.And while they expected trouble, they never expected him to die.His pastor described Burba as a man with a rough past who was trying his best to change."Anyone who knew him well would tell you he was a spiritual man, on his medication, he was compassionate, sensitive, caring," said his pastor, Charles Wilson.The officers involved have been identified as Jaron Skillman and James Richardson.Before shooting the suspect, police said they used a Taser on him, but it was not effective.KSP is investigating the case.A service will be held for Burba will be held Sunday at the LaRue County Church of Christ at 3 p.m.
