A nearly year-long investigation by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office into a fatal deputy-involved shooting concluded it was was legally justified.

Supervising deputy district attorney Simon R. Umscheid said in a written statement that under the laws of self-defense and defense of others, the shooting of James Murray, 20, of Joshua Tree by San Bernardino County Sheriff’s deputies Justin Beaver and Timothy Preston on Dec. 31, 2010 was legally justified and no criminal liability exists.

Beaver and Preston went to Murray’s Granada Drive home after receiving a complaint from neighbors that Murray was heavily intoxicated and had made threats to shoot one of the neighbors.

The deputies arrived at Murray’s residence and knocked at the door. After a short time, the front door opened and Murray pointed a gun at Beaver. Preston ordered Murray to drop the gun. Both deputies, in fear of getting shot, opened fire. Murray was hit seven times.
