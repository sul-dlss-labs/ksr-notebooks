A Los Angeles sheriff’s deputy responding to the report of a burglary in South El Monte early Sunday, March 18 shot and killed a man wielding two knives, officials said.

The shooting occurred in the 900 block of Durfee Avenue at 8:34 a.m., said Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Sgt. Vincent Plair.

The man was pronounced dead at the scene.

No officers were injured.

Deputies from the sheriff’s Temple station received a call about the possible burglary. When they arrived, they saw a man with a backpack outside a vacant home, Plair said.

He said the man fled when deputies tried to approach him. After a short pursuit, just one deputy was closest to the man, who Plair said turned around with “kitchen-type knives” in each of his hands.

When the man started to approach the deputy, he fired multiple shots, striking the man once in the upper torso, Plair said.

The man has not been identified.

Officials issued an alert on Twitter asking people to stay away from the area of Santa Anita Avenue and Durfee Avenue.
