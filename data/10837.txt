Deputy Shooting Suspect Dies

The man accused of shooting a deputy last week in Santa Rosa County died Thursday night.

The Santa Rosa County Sheriffâ€™s Office said 34-year old David Christopher Lewis (pictured) died at 8:40 p.m. Thursday as a result of injuries he received during the shooting incident.

Investigator Steve Hough of Fort Walton Beach was working as part of the US Marshals Florida Regional Fugitive Task Force serving a warrant in the 5400 block of Camille Gardens Circle near Milton when he was shot about 1:59 p.m. Friday. He was shot once in the face and twice in the leg when authorities say Lewis came out of a home shooting.

Hough remains in fair condition at Sacred Heart Hospital in Pensacola.

Lewis had active warrants for failure to appear, resisting an officer without violence, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon without intent to kill, display of a firearm during the commission of a felony, and possession of a weapon by a convicted felon. Lewis was known by officers to be violent, armed with firearm, and had made threats towards law enforcement.

The incident remains under investigation by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement.
