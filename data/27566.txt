A Livingston Parish sheriff's deputy won't face criminal charges after he shot and killed a man who came to the officer's home while he was off duty and threatened him during a domestic dispute, which escalated into a gunbattle and left the intruder dead, authorities announced Tuesday.

District Attorney Scott Perrilloux said the December shooting was "completely justifiable" and the deputy, Caleb Browning, acted in self-defense when he killed Aaron Sparkman, the estranged boyfriend of a woman who was visiting Browning at his house.

Sparkman, 30, showed up at the gated residence in Denham Springs after midnight on Dec. 16, according to an investigative summary released Tuesday. He parked outside the gates, leaving his toddler child in the car while he walked through the woods and emerged near the house, brandishing a gun.
