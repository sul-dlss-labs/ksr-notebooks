Montgomery County, Md., police said that a man in their custody died after he was subdued by a Taser.



Delric Tyrone East, 40, crashed on Route 29 near Briggs Chaney Road about 10:20 p.m. Tuesday. The 1993 two-door Cadillac he was driving crossed two lanes of traffic and slammed into a guardrail between the northbound and southbound lanes.



While fire officials pulled him from the vehicle, East allegedly acted aggressively toward them. The fire personnel requested police assistance.



As police pulled the man out of the vehicle, he continued to struggle with them, Montgomery County police said. An officer used a Taser on the man in order to take him into custody.



East was taken to Suburban Hospital, where he was pronounced dead at 11:39 p.m. The cause of death is under investigation.



Investigators report that a vial of PCP was found inside the car. A 38-year-old female passenger who was uninjured in the crash told officers the man had taken PCP before the crash.



Four officers have been placed on routine administrative leave.
