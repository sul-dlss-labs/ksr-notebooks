A man died early Tuesday morning following a fight with corrections officers at the Saline County Jail.

Jail Administrator Captain Brent Melander says that a man in his 50s was brought in at around 6:00 Monday evening by Salina Police.

Police Captain Mike Sweeney says that the man was taken into custody after allegedly punching a female acquaintance in the chin during a disturbance in the 2000 block of Norton. Sweeney says that the man resisted officers as he was being taken into custody. He was transported to the Saline County Jail and released into the custody of corrections officers.

Melander says that the suspect became disruptive in the booking area, and fought with jail corrections officers. He became unresponsive following the altercation. The man, and two corrections officers were all transported by EMS to Salina Regional Health Center.

Melander says that the man died at the hospital early Tuesday morning. His name was not immediately released pending notification of next of kin.

The corrections officers have been identified as Andrew Fillipi and David Grove. Melander says that Grove was admitted to the hospital for observation, while Fillipi was treated and released.

The Kansas Bureau of Investigation is investigating the case.
