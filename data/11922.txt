The suspect who was shot during a traffic stop in Denton County Monday afternoon is dead.

The Denton County Sheriff's Department said a deputy pulled over a white Honda Accord for speeding on FM 1173 near Krum. The sheriff's office said the suspects would not get out of their car.

Roberto Carlos Hernandez and Michael Chadwick Fry were in the car. Hernandez was in the driver's seat when he allegedly put the car into reverse and rammed into the officer's patrol vehicle according to the sheriff's office. The deputy opened fire and shot Hernandez several times.

Witnesses said the incident has shaken their quiet Denton County community.

"Other than the traffic, it's usually pretty peaceful here," witness Nancy Timmons said.

Timmons was standing in her driveway Monday afternoon when the car and patrol vehicle pulled into her driveway, then shots rang out.

"That's when I got real nervous, when I heard the shots," Timmons said. "I had no idea what was happening. Of course, I had no idea it was going to get as serious as it got."

The mechanics at the car repair shop next door also heard and watched what was happening in the Timmons' driveway.

"As soon as I heard the shots, I ducked down and was looking through the window of the vehicle," Jesse Bullard said. "I've never seen anything like that. I hope I never have to see it again."

Hernandez was taken to a Denton hospital where he died Monday night. Fry was arrested and taken to jail for probation violation on a DWI conviction.

The sheriff's office has not released the name of the deputy but said he has been working for the department for 11 years and has been placed on paid administrative leave until the investigation is complete.
