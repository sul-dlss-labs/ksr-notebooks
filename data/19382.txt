LAKE FOREST – A man driving a stolen Corvette died after he crashed the car in Lake Forest following a police chase Thursday night, authorities said.

Around 6:30 p.m., someone reported the Corvette stolen from Mission Viejo. About an hour later, deputies found the car traveling near Foxborough Way in Lake Forest and began to follow it, said Lt. Wayne Rehnelt of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department.

“The driver was non-compliant and drove off at a high rate of speed,” Rehnelt said.

Deputies searched for it for about 10 minutes before finding that the Corvette had crashed with another car at Trabuco Road and Cherry Avenue.

The driver of the Corvette, a man in his 20s, was pronounced dead at the scene, said Orange County Fire Authority Capt. Larry Kurtz.

The driver of the other car was uninjured and declined to be taken to a hospital.

The name of the man who died has not yet been released and authorities are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
