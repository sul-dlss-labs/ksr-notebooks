LYNNWOOD — The Oct. 31 death of a Lynnwood-area man who had been handcuffed by police has been attributed to natural causes, officials said.

Jay E. Dailey, 56, succumbed to heart disease, the Snohomish County Medical Examiner’s Office reported Tuesday. High blood pressure and diabetes also were considered contributing factors in the death.

An investigation is ongoing by the Snohomish County Multiple Agency Response Team. The team of detectives is assigned to cases where officers have used fatal force or where people have died in police custody.

Dailey was handcuffed that night after someone called 911 from a home along Admiralty Way, between Lynnwood and Everett. The emergency dispatcher was told that Dailey was exhibiting strange behavior and acting confused.

Firefighters arrived at the home and called for police backup. Dailey became unresponsive after being placed in handcuffs. He had not been shocked with a stun gun, said Edmonds police Sgt. Josh McClure, a spokesman for SMART. Stun guns can exacerbate heart problems.

McClure on Tuesday declined to share additional information from the investigation.

The two county sheriff’s deputies who interacted with Dailey were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure.

Investigations into in-custody deaths often take six months to a year to complete. After that happens, prosecutors must determine whether the death involved a crime. The sheriff’s office then will review the case to determine whether the deputies followed agency policies.

An earlier news release by police misstated Dailey’s age.
