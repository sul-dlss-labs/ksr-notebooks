Authorities have identified Kaylene Stone, 49, as the woman shot and killed by Glendale police in a Circle K parking lot in Peoria on Wednesday morning.

An undercover unit with the Glendale Police Department had been following Stone, who was wanted on a dangerous drug warrant, according to Tracey Breeden, spokeswoman for the Glendale Police Department.

Officials said Stone was a passenger in a vehicle driven by a male when the two made a stop at the Circle K on the corner of 67th and Peoria avenues.

"[The officers] were following the vehicle in a covert way," Breeden said. "[They] stopped to get gas and that's when our officers attempted to make contact."

According to Jay Davies of the Peoria Police Department, the man who was driving went into the store, and two officers approached the vehicle at about 10:15 a.m. Davies said Stone displayed a handgun and did not drop it when ordered to.

Davies said officers began shooting and Stone was struck multiple times. She was transported to a local hospital where she was pronounced dead. No one else was injured.

Two young men riding bicycles in a parking lot across the street at the time of the shooting told reporters they heard at least a dozen gunshots.

Police are interviewing the man who was with her, but said he is not a suspect.

Breeden said Stone had an extensive criminal history involving drugs.

The incident is being jointly investigated by the Glendale and Peoria police departments.

Per standard protocol, the two officers who shot Stone will be on leave pending the investigation, Breeden said.
