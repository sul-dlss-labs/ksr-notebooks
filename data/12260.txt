NORTH MANKATO â€” Authorities say police fatally shot an 83-year-old North Mankato man after he fired at officers following a three-hour standoff.

The Minnesota Department of Public Safety identifies the man as Lloyd Hodgson Tschohl (shohl).

A family member had asked police Wednesday to check on Tschohl, but he refused to speak with officers.

On Thursday, family members again contacted police, saying Tschohl had weapons in his home. Again, Tschohl would not speak with police, so they asked for help from the River Valley Tactical Response Team.

Around 2 p.m., authorities say Tschohl fired on the officers through a window and a door, then came out and began firing at police. Three officers returned fire, striking Tschohl.
