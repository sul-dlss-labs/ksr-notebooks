KALAMAZOO, MI -- Police have identified all five people killed in a fiery crash near Kalamazoo.

Cortavian Murphy, 16, Jaquarius Hegler, 15, and Elexus Hillsman, 16, were killed in the Saturday, Sept. 2, crash near the intersection of East Main and North Sprinkle Road, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said in a Sept. 5 news release.

On Sunday, Sept. 3, the Kalamazoo County Medical Examiner's Office identified Marshawn Williams, 15, and Deztanee Cobb, 17, as victims.

The crash occurred shortly before 1 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 2, when a car left the road near the intersection of East Main Street and North Sprinkle Road.

Police released the dash-cam video just hours after the crash.

A Kalamazoo Township officer spotted the speeding Dodge Charger at 12:43 a.m. Saturday, Sept. 2 going an estimated 100 mph in the 200 block of East Main Street, police said.

The dash-cam video shows the officer, who was stopped when the vehicle passed, briefly activated his lights and sirens and started pursuing.

After about 20 seconds, he tells a dispatcher: "Yeah, I'm going to have to terminate it. It's well over 100 mph."

The officer turns off his overhead lights and slows his vehicle, continuing down East Main. He comes upon the flaming crash scene down the road about 90 seconds later.

All victims have been identified by the medical examiners office with direct notification to their families, the Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Office said Tuesday.
