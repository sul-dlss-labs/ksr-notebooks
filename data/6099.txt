Facebook KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) Â— A man who opened fire at a shopping mall and killed two people this week had been using the home of a next-door neighbor while her dead body lay on the floor, police said Wednesday. "It might be a stretch to say that he was living there," said Detective Alane Booth of the Kansas City Police Department. "But it would be reasonable to say he left and came back and had taken advantage of some of the things she had that he didn't have, like food, water and electricity." David W. Logsdon, 51, was shot to death by police Sunday at the Ward Parkway Center after he killed two shoppers. Seven other people were injured. His neighbor, Patricia Ann Reed, 67, was found beaten to death in her home about two hours before a police officer stopped Logsdon for driving Reed's car. The officer and Logsdon were wounded in an exchange of gunfire before Logsdon sped off to the mall. Police suspect Logsdon killed Reed. "We haven't technically proved it yet," Booth said. "But it's more probable than not that he's the person responsible for her death." Investigators were awaiting test results to determine how long Reed had been dead, but it was likely a few days, Booth said. She was last seen by her family April 21. Booth could not confirm a report in The Kansas City Star that Logsdon used a semiautomatic rifle that belonged to Reed's late husband in the rampage at Ward Parkway. Logsdon used Reed's credit card five days before the mall shooting to buy three empty 20-round magazines for a rifle, police said. It was unclear where he got the bullets, they said. It's likely Logsdon had been using Reed's home because of the deteriorating condition of his own home, where Logsdon had to improvise because the electricity and water were cut off after he did not pay the bills. Logsdon had a history of mental illness, according to his sister, Kathy Cagg. Logsdon had been an employee of the Target store at the mall, but "he left on his own accord" in November 2006, the company said in a statement. The company said it would not provide any other details about his employment. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
