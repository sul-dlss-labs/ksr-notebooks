Phoenix police identified the man fatally shot after trying to flee officers in a stolen vehicle on Wednesday as Victor Rivera, 27.

An occupied stolen vehicle was spotted in the area of 91st Avenue and McDowell Road shortly after 3 p.m., according to Sgt. Jonathan Howard, a police spokesman. Officers attempted to stop the man but stayed back when he fled in the vehicle. Police helicopters followed him as he drove east on Interstate 10 and exited at 75th Avenue, Howard said.

According to Howard's report released Thursday, two officers approached the man in the vehicle, opened the car doors and ordered him to surrender. The man kicked the officer at the driverâ€™s side door and shifted the car into reverse, pinning the officer between the moving car and door. The vehicle struck other vehicles stopped at the off-ramp.

The second officer at the passenger window ran in front of the vehicle to help his partner, and the man began to drive forward, striking more cars and endangering those cars' occupants as well as the police officer, Howard said.

The officer caught in the car door fired one shot, striking Rivera, Howard said. He was taken to a local hospital, where he died of his injuries.

Five vehicles, including the stolen vehicle, were damaged, but no significant injuries to the drivers or passengers were reported.

The officer, 40, who has 16 years of police experience, was placed on administrative leave pending a review of the incident, which is standard department procedure, Howard said.
