Hotel guest, confronted by police, deletes cellphone images of Sheraton crime scene

A hotel guest received a visit from a Bakersfield police officer the day after a shootout at the Four Points by Sheraton in 2013.

She may not soon forget it.

According to an investigative report obtained by The Californian, Julie Fitzwater, situated in Room 551, was spotted at her window capturing images on her cellphone as investigators scoured the hotel parking lot searching for evidence.

One day earlier, on Sept. 16, 2013, officers shot to death wanted felon Justin Harger and confidential police informant Jorge Ramirez in the parking lot below Fitzwater’s window.

While recording officers’ activities on a cellphone is perfectly legal, Bakersfield police Detective Marcela Garcia nevertheless directed Officer Jared Deiderich to knock on the woman’s door.

“Officer Deiderich later told me,” Garcia wrote in her report, “he was able to make contact with Fitzwater, who admitted to taking several photographs of officers’ activities.

“She apologized,” Garcia continued.

Fitzwater showed the officer the images, “and in his presence, and on her own” deleted them from her phone.”

Then she apologized again.

It wasn’t the first time in recent years cellphone recordings by innocent bystanders have led to visits by local law enforcement. Witnesses outside Kern Medical Center in May 2013 who shot video of officers grappling with David Sal Silva, who later died, said Kern County sheriff’s deputies confiscated their phones in the hours following that incident. Those video images were never recovered.
