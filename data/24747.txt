The name of the suspects and Valencia County deputy involved in a deadly shooting last week have been released.

Investigators say Deputy Ashley Martinez fired the shot that killed 34-year-old Virginia Romero.

She and another deputy were called out to a burglary in progress on Brazaro Road, east of Los Lunas.

State Police say when the deputies arrived, they found Romero and 45-year-old Daniel Ibuado.

Ibuado was immediately arrested for an outstanding warrant for aggravated burglary and placed in the back seat of a deputy’s car.

Deputies say while they were speaking with Ibuado and others, Romero got into the driver’s seat of the deputy’s car and started to take off.

According to State Police, Deputy Martinez fired a shot, hitting and killing Romero. That’s how the deputy’s cruiser ended up driving through a fence and into a home.

Valencia County officials say Deputy Martinez remains on paid administrative leave.

She has been with the department about two-and-a-half years.
