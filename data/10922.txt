Chicago police shot and killed a man in the Marquette Park neighborhood after chasing him down an alley and into a gangway about 12:10 a.m. Sunday, according to officials.

Chicago Lawn District officers heard gunfire in the vicinity of 72nd Street and Campbell Avenue and went into an alley to investigate, said Pat Camden, spokesman for the Fraternal Order of Police.

The officers saw a man in backyard in the area with a gun in his hand, identified themselves as officers and told him to drop the gun, according to a release from the Chicago Police Department.

The man ran from the scene and police pursued him, the release said, and they again ordered him to drop the weapon. The offender then ran down a set of stairs toward a basement where he turned and pointed a handgun at the pursuing officers, who shot him, officials said.
