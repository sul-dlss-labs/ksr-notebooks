NATCHITOCHES, LA (KSLA) - The Diocese of Alexandria has released a statement regarding the deadly officer-involved shooting at a Natchitoches church on Wednesday.

It happened just after 2:30 p.m. at the Holy Cross Catholic Church in the 100 block of Second Street.



Neighbors report hearing about 4 quick shots, then saw several law enforcement vehicles arrive on the scene.

Two deputies were reportedly serving a Physicians Emergency Commitment (PEC) order to a man at the church. Gunshots were exchanged between the deputies and the suspect, identified as 26-year-old Robert Vercher of Natchitoches. Vercher was struck several times and was transported to Natchitoches Regional Medical Center where he was pronounced dead.

The deputies names have not been released. Both deputies have been placed on paid administrative leave. Neither of the deputies were injured during the incident.

In a statement released Thursday afternoon, the Diocese of Alexandria said they are "deeply saddened by the recent events that occurred on October 29, 2014 at Holy Cross Church, Natchitoches, LA. While diocesan policy prohibits speaking to matters under investigation by civil authorities we do ask for your prayers for all parties involved."

Natchitoches Parish Sheriff Victor Jones Jr. also asked on Wednesday that "we remember in our prayers all those involved in today's tragic event."

The investigation is ongoing by the Natchitoches Police Department.
