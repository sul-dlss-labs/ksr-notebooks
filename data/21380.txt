A man from Republic died after he crashed a stolen car while leading police on a chase.

The Missouri State Highway Patrol reports Chris Wilder, 34, was killed after he crashed his car into a tree and was thrown from the vehicle. Troopers said he was fleeing from Christian County deputies.

Investigators said Wilder ran off the road at Highway ZZ, three miles south of Republic. The Jeep Cherokee hit a tree, became airborne, and he, and a woman passenger were thrown from the vehicle. The woman, whose name has not been released, suffered serious injuries and was taken to a Springfield hospital.

Christian County Sheriff Brad Cole said the chase began after a deputy saw the Jeep parked in the Delaware Town conservation area several hours after the area was closed to the public. The car sped away when the deputy tried to talk to the people about why they were there after hours.

Investigators later determined the Jeep Wilder was driving was stolen.
