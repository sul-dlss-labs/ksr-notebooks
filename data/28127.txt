A 17-year-old driver was killed Sunday morning when her car was hit by a vehicle involved in a chase.

Jada Deleonardo of Decatur died at the scene of the wreck, which happened on Moreland Avenue near Constitution Road, according to the Georgia State Patrol. A passenger in her car, 19-year-old Reniya Armstead of Stone Mountain, was seriously injured.

The State Patrol initially identified Clayton County police as the agency that began the chase. A spokeswoman for that department said late Sunday night that the Clayton County Sheriff’s Office was the only agency involved.

“At no point was the Clayton County Police Department involved in this pursuit,” Lt. Cherie West said in a statement.

The sheriff’s office has not made a statement on the incident.

According to the GSP, deputies were chasing four suspects in a vehicle that entered DeKalb County about 3:30 a.m. Sunday. The details of what led to the pursuit are not clear.

Deleonardo was taking a left turn to head north on Moreland Avenue. As she turned, the car involved in the chase ran a red light and smashed into her vehicle, the GSP said.

Deleonardo’s Chevrolet Cavalier was hit on the left side by the fleeing Mitsubishi Gallant. Armstead was taken to Grady Memorial Hospital in critical condition.

An update on her condition was not provided Monday. A GoFundMe page was created to assist Deleonardo's family with funeral expenses.

The four suspects in the Mitsubishi were also taken to Grady, and their conditions are unknown. They were identified as Sebastin Miles, 28, of Riverdale; Rodney Harris, 44, of Fayetteville; Montreaz Harris, 28, of Atlanta; and Brandon Wyldon, 31, of Riverdale.

Charges are pending the conclusion of the investigation, a GSP spokesman said Monday.
