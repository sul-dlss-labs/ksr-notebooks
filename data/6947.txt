A man who was killed in a shootout Friday involving two sheriff's deputies at an Avra Valley home was identified on Sunday.

Vincent Samuel Azzarello, 25, of Tucson was killed at about 1 p.m. when gunfire was exchanged between him and Deputy Matthew D. Salmon at a home in the 5500 block of North Anway Road, at West Sunset Road, said Deputy Dawn Hanke, a Pima County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman.

Azzarello — who fired at Salmon at least once, hitting him in the chest, and at Deputy Bruce E. Haufe, hitting him in the hand — was shot by Salmon at least once, Hanke said.

It is not known how many shots were exchanged between Azzarello and Salmon, she said.

Azzarello is believed to have been involved in a domestic dispute earlier in the day.

Salmon, who was protected by a bulletproof vest, was released from a hospital on Saturday, Hanke said.
