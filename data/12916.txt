The Santa Rosa Police Department, in conjunction with the Sonoma County District Attorney’s Office, is investigating this morning’s fatal shooting of an armed stabbing suspect by two Sonoma County Sheriff’s Deputies assigned to the Windsor Police Department. After the shooting, the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office invoked the Sonoma County Law Enforcement Employee-Involved Fatal Incident Protocol and requested that the Santa Rosa Police Department lead the investigation of this incident. After interviews with the victim, involved deputies and other witnesses, along with the examination of the crime scene, we can provide the following information about this incident.

At about 7:29 am on Saturday, June 8 the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office received multiple phone calls about a stabbing that had just happened at the Starbucks at 1001 Mclelland Drive in downtown Windsor. Witnesses reported that a male suspect stabbed a woman and then fled on foot. The victim, a Windsor resident, received major wounds in the assault and is being treated at a local hospital. She will survive. We are not releasing her name pursuant to state law because the attack was a domestic violence incident. The suspect and victim have a previous romantic relationship and an adult child together.

Two deputies from the Windsor Police Department arrived at the scene within two minutes of the initial 911 call. The suspect, Urbano Moreno Morales (48 years old), ran from the scene after slashing the victim with a knife. Morales fled toward the Windsor Town Green and the Windsor Police Department. He ran from the first deputy he encountered, who reported that Morales was stabbing himself with the knife. Morales stopped a short distance from the Police Department and two deputies held him at gunpoint while ordering him in English and Spanish to drop his knife. At least one of the deputies fired a Taser at Morales in an attempt to safely take him into custody. The Taser was not effective, and Morales ignored the deputies commands. He charged at the deputies and they fired their handguns at him. One or more bullets hit Morales, stopping his attack. The deputies called for emergency medical aid for both the stabbing victim and Morales, along with emergency law enforcement assistance from neighboring agencies. Morales was declared deceased at 7:38 am.
