Luis Varela Jr., a 29-year-old Latino, died Monday, May 16, two days after he was shot by police in the 600 block of South Grand Avenue in Glendora, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

A Glendora police officer attempted to detain Varela on May 14 about 11 p.m., according to a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department news release. The officer believed Varela may have been involved in an armed robbery, which occurred earlier in the day at a Kohl's department store.

Authorities said that when police approached Varela, he pulled out a handgun and ran into a Ralph's grocery store. When the officer went after Varela, he allegedly fired his gun at the officer, officials said.

At that point, the officer fired his weapon at Varela, striking him in the head, according to coroner's records.

Paramedics called to the scene took Varela to a hospital where he remained until his death May 16 at 10:46 a.m.

Anyone with additional information about the incident is asked to contact the sheriff's homicide bureau at (323) 890-5500. Those wishing to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
