A Gurnee man shot Sunday by an off-duty Chicago police detective died Wednesday from multiple gunshot wounds to his chest and neck, a spokeswoman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said.

Blue Sexton, 32, died at Stroger Hospital, where he was being treated while in custody on $300,000 bond. Sexton was charged with attempted murder, aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and not having a firearm owner's identification card. Police said Sexton, a reputed member of the Conservative Vice Lords with affiliations to other gangs, pointed a gun at the detective outside the Hollywood Grill, 1601 W. North Ave., at 5 a.m.

The off-duty detective had just left the restaurant and was driving out of indoor parking in an alley behind the restaurant when he was blocked by a Lincoln Navigator in which Sexton was a passenger, Cook County state's attorney's office spokeswoman Tandra Simonton and police said.

The detective fired at him twice before Sexton retreated to the Navigator, refusing to drop his gun, Simonton said. The detective fired three more times.
