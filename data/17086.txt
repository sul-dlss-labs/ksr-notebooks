​A U.S. Marshals Service deputy shot and killed a man wanted for murder in South Carolina who pulled out a gun during an arrest on Saturday in a parking lot at 10th Street and Cliff Avenue.

Lonnie Haskell Powers, Jr. of Summerville, S.C., was wanted in connection with a murder on Dec. 13, according to the Berkeley County, S.C., sheriff’s office.

Authorities received a tip that Powers, 37, was in Sioux Falls and contacted the detectives and marshals in South Dakota. They tracked Powers to the parking lot and when confronted, authorities say, he pulled out a handgun.

Powers was shot once in the chest, killing him.

Who are the U.S. marshals?

The U.S. Marshals Service is a law enforcement agency that handles warrants served for federal crimes.

Gene Abdallah, who served as South Dakota's U.S. marshal for 12 years beginning in 1982, said that marshals are essentially federal sheriffs.

"Marshals have jurisdiction over federal land," Abdallah said.

This includes any major crime that occurs on a reservation, such as murder, rape or robbery, he said.

Federal crimes also include bank robbery and counterfeiting, regardless of what jurisdiction in which they are committed. The marshals also handle any suspects who need to be extradited internationally.

Once the FBI investigates a federal crime and issues a federal warrant, the U.S. Marshals Service partners with local agencies to track down the suspect and arrest them.

"The FBI is the investigative agency," Abdallah said. "Either (the FBI will) arrest them on the spot, or ... a warrant is issued and the marshals will go get them or try to find them.

"I was just trying to be safe"

At 1:31 p.m. on Saturday, police surrounded the Lewis parking lot with guns drawn.

Theresa Stehly said her car was near the man's vehicle in the parking lot. She was coming out of the store while the situation was unfolding.

"I heard loud talking and I saw there were marshals on either side of this vehicle and police officers ... with their guns drawn," Stehly said. "I heard them assuring him (the suspect) that if he got out of the vehicle he wouldn't be hurt."

Brandon Bad Heart Bull was shopping inside Lewis when a manager told people to stay inside.

Bad Heart Bull said the people around him were calm and that he stayed inside while the marshals were confronting the man. A Lewis employee did not know how long the store was closed during the incident.

"One of the managers told me there was some action going on outside," Bad Heart Bull said. "I was just trying to be safe."
