A Wayne man found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound after what was treated as a barricaded gunman incident has been identified.

Entering the home on Ash at just before 9 p.m. Monday, officers found Stanley Thomas Killebrew Jr., 39, dead in his home.

“There was no gunshot as we entered. We’re not the medical examiner, but he appeared to have been dead for awhile,” Wayne Police Lt. Ryan Strong said.

Killebrew is survived by his mother Margaret, sister Sarah and son Andrew. His family described Killebrew as a loving father, brother and son, who loved to work on cars, play games with his son, and loved life. A GoFundMe page was set to help offset funeral costs.

Killebrew had called police at about 10:30 a.m. to have his mother and sister leave the home on Ash at the southeast corner with Wayne Road. Both women left and Killebrew was barricaded alone in the house, not responding to telephone calls or other efforts to communicate with him.

Returning several hours later, Sarah Killebrew could only get within several hundred feet of the home due to police barricades and shouted for her brother to respond Monday afternoon.

“This is not him. He snapped. I don’t what happened. He doesn’t have mental issues,” Killebrew said. “He’s a wonderful father, a good man, a kindhearted person. He needs help. I don’t want him to get hurt.”

With the home located directly north across the Rouge River from Wayne City Hall, that building and nearby municipal buildings including 29th District Court, were locked down.

Wayne Memorial High School was on a precautionary lockdown, which allowed students to be released at their normal time.
