Yorkville police and the New York State Attorney General's Office are investigating the death of a Whitesboro man who crashed his motorcycle.

Nathaniel Harvey, 45, died from his injuries after he lost control of his motorcycle on Route 69 in the village of Whitesboro shortly after 1:15 a.m. Sunday, Yorkville police said in a news release Wednesday.

A Yorkville police officer attempted to stop Harvey after observing him speeding on Oriskany Boulevard, but after Harvey slowed down, he suddenly accelerated away, police said.

The officer saw him lose control and appear to hydroplane, officials said. When the officer came upon the scene, he saw Harvey had been ejected from his motorcycle and called for first responders.

Harvey was pronounced dead at the scene, police said.

An earlier news release from Whitesboro police, who said they assisted at the scene, states Harvey crashed between Clinton and Westmoreland streets in Whitesboro.

Yorkville police said the officer was following a department policy that had been put back into effect in April, though the statement did not elaborate on the policy.

The Oneida County District Attorney's Office and state Attorney General's Office were contacted shortly after the accident. Investigations are underway by the New York State Police and Attorney General's Office, as well as an internal investigation, Yorkville police said.

New York State law requires the Attorney General's Office of Special Investigation to investigate any incident in which a police officer may have caused the death of a person.
