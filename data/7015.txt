ANAHEIM – Police Wednesday released the identity of a 31-year-old man who was shot and killed during a confrontation with two officers last week.

Haslin Rosales-Carreto, of Placentia, was sitting in a white sedan parked in a graffiti-covered alley on South Citron Street, near West Vermont Avenue, the morning of March 24 when the confrontation happened, police said.

Rosales-Carreto got out of the sedan and both officers fired, hitting him twice in the upper body, police said. He died at a hospital.

Details of what led to the fatal shooting have not been disclosed pending the ongoing investigation, said Anaheim police Sgt. Rick Martinez.

But Martinez did say that Rosales-Carreto was armed, although there was no exchange of fire with the officers. The type of weapon found has not been disclosed.

The names of the two officers have not been released, Martinez said.

Rosales-Carreto had other brushes with the law. Last year, he pleaded not guilty to possession of burglary tools and the case was later dismissed, according to court records. He also had traffic violations, records show.

The Orange County District Attorney’s Office is investigating the shooting, as is standard procedure for all officer-involved shootings.

Police are looking for witnesses and are asking anyone with information to call the Anaheim Police Department at 714-765-1944.
