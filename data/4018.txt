Byron Meads

Sgt. Jeremy Newchurch

Monday, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) made new claims that a bullet fired by another deputy, not the murder suspect, is the bullet that killed Assumption Sheriff's Sergeant Jeremy Newchurch. The NAACP says the man charged in the killing, drug-suspect Byron Meads, should be set free.

Lynn Meads wept as NAACP leaders showed pictures of her son Byron, black and blue. The pictures were allegedly taken March 2, the morning after Assumption Sheriff's deputies arrested and charged Byron Meads with the shooting death of 31-year-old Sergeant Jeremy Newchurch.

"It hurts," says Lynn Meads. "It hurts to see your child beat up like that."

Jerome Boykin, Sr., an NAACP regional vice president, would not say who took the pictures, but claims deputies beat Byron Meads while they were taking him to jail, while calling him "the n-word".

Assumption Sheriff's detectives say during a drug investigation, Meads and another deputy were struggling over the deputy's gun when it went off and struck Newchurch in the chest. Boykin claims it was not Meads who fired the weapon: " their own officer shot and killed Sgt. Jeremy Newchurch."

"Mr. Meads did not have a gun. Mr. Meads did not fire a shot killing Mr. Newchurch," according to Allen Myles, Byron Meads' attorney.

Myles claims to have ballistics evidence he'll present in court to clear Meads. As for Meads' mother, she has this message for the Newchurch family: "I know they lost a loved one. And I know they're grieving. My heart goes out to them."

Assumption Parish Sheriff Mike Waguespack and District Attorney Tony Falterman both declined to respond to the claims made. Both say they don't want the case tried in the media.

Byron Meads is charged with manslaughter and remains in the Assumption Parish jail where he's being held without bond. He's due in court June 12.
