At approximately 6 p.m., the sheriff’s office requested the help of the state police SWAT team, and when they arrived, Lutcher reportedly moved from inside the residence to an enclosed porch, the statement said.

While Lutcher was on the porch, troopers and deputies entered the house from the rear and rescued the hostage.

Lutcher then reportedly broke a window and reentered the house, attempting to arm himself, the statement said.

Officers used pepper spray and a Taser, but the non-lethal force was ineffective, the statement said.

When Lutcher reportedly assaulted the officers with a gun, they used lethal force to stop the assault, the statement said.

Lutcher received immediate medical treatment but died on the scene, the statement said.

The Tensas Parish Sheriff’s Office and the state police’s Region II Criminal Investigations unit are currently investigating the incident.
