Chicago police fatally shot a man Thursday after he charged at them with a lead pipe and a meat cleaver in the Back of the Yards neighborhood, police said.

A woman called 911 after seeing the unidentified man, thought to be in his late 20s, pouring lighter fluid on himself in an alley in the 4500 block of South Wood Street about 4:45 p.m, police said.

Two Deering District officers responded, saw the man wielding the pipe and the cleaver and told him to drop the weapons, said Deputy Chief Michael Shields.

The officers hit the man with chemical spray, but he lunged at the officers with the weapons, causing both to shoot him, Shields said.

He was not sure how many shots were fired or where the man was hit. Wentworth Area detectives are investigating.

Police said Thursday evening that they don't know the identity of the man or whether he lived in the neighborhood.

This marks the third police shooting -- two of which have been fatal -- in the last week.

Derrick Traylor Jr., 19, was seriously wounded by Chicago police Sunday after he pointed a gun at officers outside his home in the 800 block of West 71st Street on the South Side, officials said. Traylor was charged with aggravated assault of a police officer.

On Saturday, Shannon Kraft, 34, was shot and killed when he charged officers with a machete and a serrated knife inside an apartment in the 8500 block of West Winnemac Avenue, officials said.

Police determined both weekend shootings were justified.
