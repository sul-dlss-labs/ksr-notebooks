A La Marque K9 officer shot and killed a suspect overnight who was reportedly threatening him and his dog with a sword.

The victim and the suspect lived next door to each other on Retama street. They’ve known each other for five years and were reportedly friendly.

But 62-year-old Greg Ham’s behavior had deteriorated in the past several months, said Felize Staples, another neighbor.

Staples called police for the fifth time in about seven days Sunday night around 10. She says Ham had broken into her home again, but this time he had a sword.

She shared photos of the damage, saying he broke down her front door and used furniture to block her inside her bedroom.

Police arrived and freed Staples, then went next door to arrest Ham.

La Marque P olice Chief Kirk Jackson says body cam video shows Ham threatening the officer with a sword before the officer fired.

The officer and the canine were both cut. Both were treated and released.
