LUMBERTON, N.C. â€” Investigators found four guns at the site of a Monday crash south of Lumberton that killed four teens.

Kadaufei Worley, 16, of Lumberton, Tylek McNair, 18, and Kashawn Leonard, 19, both of Fairmont, and Daylon Cummings, 15, of Rowland, died when the Nissan Maxima they were in collided head-on with a Robeson County Schools bus in the 2900 block of Wire Grass Road, authorities said.

The Maxima was traveling at 80 mph in a 55-mph zone at the time of the crash and was being followed by a Robeson County Sheriff's Office patrol car, according to the North Carolina State Highway Patrol. The deputy never engaged in a pursuit of the car and was only responding to a report of a suspicious vehicle, a Highway Patrol spokesman said.

"This suspicious vehicle has been the subject of multiple sightings in the area of Lovette Road," Maj. Anthony Thompson of the sheriff's office said in a statement.

The force of the collision caused the car to split into three sections. Investigators found three guns in the wreckage Monday and found a fourth gun when they returned to the crash site Tuesday, Thompson said.

No students were on the school bus when the crash occurred. The school bus was headed from Fairmont High School to the bus maintenance shop for some work.

A maintenance worker, Kinyata Locklear, 36, of Maxton, was the only person aboard. He suffered serious but non-life-threatening injuries and was transferred from Southeastern Regional Medical Center in Lumberton to Duke University Hospital in Durham for treatment.
