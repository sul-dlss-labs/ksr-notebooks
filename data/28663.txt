HIGHLAND >> Sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a hatchet-wielding man Wednesday morning, according to the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department.

The department identified the deceased as Highland resident Eric Andrews, 30.

“Around 9:20 a.m., several people called 9-1-1 to report two men fighting” in the 6800 block of Victoria Avenue, sheriff’s spokeswoman Cindy Bachman said.

Deputies found the suspect standing over the victim who had been moderately injured by a sharp object, she added.

The suspect was taken to Loma Linda University Medical Center where he was pronounced dead, officials added.

The status of the victim was unknown.
