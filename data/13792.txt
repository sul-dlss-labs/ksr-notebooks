A short chase in western Iowa Wednesday ended with a crash that killed the suspect.

It happened on Highway 59 between Avoca and Harlan Wednesday afternoon.

Harlan police tried to pull over 52-year-old Bruce Coenen around 12:30 p.m. after callers reported seeing him speeding up to 100 miles per hour. Coenen didn’t stop, and led officers on a chase south of Harlan.

Police say he died when his vehicle crashed into a vehicle driven by a Department of Transportation worker. Coenen’s vehicle caught fire and he was killed.

Two DOT peace officers inside of the car were injured, 58-year-old Kent Leibe and 40-year-old Brian Rink.

Police believe Coenen had been drinking and driving.
