PORTAGE -- Police shot and killed a 42-year-old Portage man who apparently charged at them with an "edged weapon" early Friday morning while they were responding to a disturbance call at the Marine Drive Mobile Home Park.

The victim, Bruce Carroll of 51 Bass Drive, was shot once in the chest. Carroll died a short time later at Portage Community Hospital.

According to Cpl. John Ryan, a spokesman for the Portage Police Department, a neighbor called police at 12:32 a.m. reporting that a woman ran from the residence and was then chased by a man who dragged her back inside.

When officers arrived, the said they heard signs of a disturbance coming from inside the mobile home, but no one came to the door after police knocked several times. After forcing entry, police said they found Carroll holding some sort of weapon.

"Officers observed the male charge at them with a edged weapon raised over his head," according to a statement issued by the Portage Police Department. "The male was repeatedly ordered to drop the weapon. When he disregarded the officer's commands and continued to charge them, one shot from a handgun was fired striking the male in the chest."

The Indiana State Police are handling the investigation and Portage police are not releasing the names of the officers involved. Carroll's body was transported to South Bend where an autopsy was scheduled for Friday afternoon.
