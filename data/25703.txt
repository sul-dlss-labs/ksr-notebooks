Armed man shot, killed by San Bernardino police after charging at officers, police say

SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (KABC) -- A man was shot by San Bernardino police and later died after allegedly charging at officers during a confrontation early Monday.

The shooting occurred at the intersection of 4th and Allen streets.

Police said when an officer confronted the armed suspect, the man charged at them. In cellphone video, the suspect is heard yelling at police, saying he wanted to die.

Video from the encounter shows the suspect shirtless and telling officers to shoot him.

Police told the suspect to put the weapon down but were unsuccessful. A sergeant on scene deployed less-lethal shotgun rounds to gain compliance and when that didn't work, officers deployed a Taser, which was also unsuccessful, police said. At that point, the suspect allegedly charged at the officers and an officer fired at the suspect.

San Bernardino police later confirmed the suspect died from his injuries. He was pronounced dead at the hospital shortly before 12:30 a.m.

It was not known what weapon the suspect was allegedly armed with.

Police are investigating the shooting.
