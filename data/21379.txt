BATAVIA, IL - A 31-year-old Batavia man killed in a motorcycle crash following a brief chase with police over the weekend has been identified as Joseph G. Graves, police said Monday.

Meanwhile, a passenger on the motorcycle, who authorities initially reported had died, remains in critical condition at Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove where she was airlifted after the Saturday evening crash. Authorities said Sunday the information regarding the woman's death was "given in error," the Daily Herald reports. The crash happened after a Batavia Police Department officer attempted to pull the motorcycle over on Wind Energy Pass at Kirk Road at about 5:25 p.m. on Saturday after observing it heading south at a high rate of speed. Police said the motorcycle was driving 80 mph in a 45 mph zone.

The officer activated his emergency light but the motorcycle failed to stop, according to a Batavia Police Department news release. The motorcycle turned west on Wind Energy Pass, accelerated to a high rate of speed before failing to stop at a stop sign at Wind Energy Pass and Wagner Road, according to the press release.

The motorcycle continued west to the 1200 block of Wind Energy Pass where it struck the rear drivers' side of a passenger vehicle that was backing from the street into his private driveway. Both the driver and passenger were ejected from the motorcycle, according to police. The driver of the motorcycle was pronounced dead at the scene. He has since been identified as Joseph G. Graves, 31, of the 300 block of S. Jackson Street in Batavia.

The female passenger was airlifted by helicopter to Good Samaritan Hospital in Downers Grove where she remains in critical condition. Authorities have not released her identity. The driver of the passenger vehicle was not injured during the traffic crash.
