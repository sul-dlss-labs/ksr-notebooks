Two officers who shot and killed an armed suspect in Greeley last month have been cleared of any wrongdoing by the Weld County District Attorney’s Office, the office said Tuesday.

Victor Daniel Hernandez pointed a handgun at the officers as they responded to a report of a “crazy guy with a gun” at a Greeley hotel in the early morning hours of June 14, the office said. Hernandez was shot three times by the officers before he was rushed to a hospital and pronounced dead.

Hernandez earlier that morning had fled a disturbance at a Greeley bar before police arrived. Just before he was shot, the office says Hernandez assaulted his girlfriend.

Before he was shot, Hernandez told one of the officers, “I am out on bond and I am not going back to jail.”
