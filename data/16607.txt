A man who died following a struggle with Long Beach police has been identified as 47-year-old Manuel Ornelas, authorities said Sunday.

Officers were called to a home in the 3200 block of Ladoga Avenue about 10:40 a.m. on Saturday in response to complaints that Ornelas was under the influence of narcotics and acting violently, according to a statement from Long Beach police.

When they arrived, the officers found Ornelas “bleeding profusely, possibly from cuts that he sustained while breaking out the windows,” according to the statement.

Ornelas attempted to flee the home, leading officers to confront him with “non-lethal means, which included ... an electronic control device, physical force, and a carotid restraint, to take him into custody,” the department said.

Once the man was subdued, officers monitored his condition, but he went into cardiac arrest. The officers then initiated “life-saving measures.”

Paramedics arrived soon after and transported Ornelas to Los Alamitos Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. Ornelas was identified by the Orange County coroner’s office.

The incident is now under investigation by the Los Angeles County district attorney -- standard practice for in-custody deaths.
