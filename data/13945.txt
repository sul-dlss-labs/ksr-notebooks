Paul Smith, a 58-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police officers on Jan. 14 in the 1000 block of West 62nd Street in Vermont-Slauson, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Smith, who was wanted in connection with a robbery at a nearby L.A. Fitness, barricaded himself in a home in South Los Angeles before being shot by police SWAT officers who went inside.

The shooting occurred about 8:30 a.m., when police went to the home to investigate a robbery at a gym hours earlier, but the suspect approached the front door with a gun, said LAPD Sgt. Albert Gonzalez.

No officers were hurt in the incident, Gonzalez said.
