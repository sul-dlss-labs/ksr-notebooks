An armed man shot and killed by Phoenix police Monday night has been identified as Levi Gene Wilson, 39.

Officers were called to the scene by Wilson's sister, who called 911 because Wilson had fired a gun in the house, near 19th Avenue and Peoria Road. The sister informed police that her brother was behaving strangely, according to James Holmes, Phoenix police spokesman.

When officers arrived, the man refused to leave the house and threatened to shoot anyone who attempted to enter, Holmes said. Negotiators and detectives from the Phoenix Police Special Assignments Unit spent six hours trying to help him leave peacefully.

Around midnight, Wilson left the house carrying a handgun. He pointed the gun at himself and then at officers, who then shot him, Holmes said.

Wilson was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Holmes said.
