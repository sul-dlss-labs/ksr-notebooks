ARLINGTON — A sniper killed in a shootout with police about 50 miles north of Seattle was described Wednesday as a disabled military veteran who was recently divorced and had mental health problems.

Robert Edward Endrizzi, 60, died from multiple gunshot wounds, the Snohomish County medical examiner’s office said.

Two deputies are on leave during the investigation into Sunday’s shooting, said Snohomish County sheriff’s spokeswoman Shari Ireton. They were part of the SWAT team that responded to the report of a sniper who wounded one man and shot several vehicles.

Investigators aren’t ready to comment on what may have led to the shooting, Ireton said Wednesday.

Endrizzi’s mother told KOMO News that her son had worked in the medical field but retired after a motorcycle accident. She said he had mental health problems.
