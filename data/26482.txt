TIFTON, GA (WALB) - The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) issued a release Thursday afternoon that the agency will investigate the death of a Tift County man who died Wednesday after an altercation with Tift County deputies.

The GBI said that in the early morning hours on Wednesday, the deputies responded to the 300 block of Hall Road in Tifton, for complaints about a disturbance in the area.

Deputies met James Aaron McBrayer, 41, and began assessing the situation, when an altercation happened between them and McBrayer, according to the GBI.

One deputy was injured and required medical attention after attempting to take him into custody.

In the struggle, deputies deployed a taser but it was ineffective. They finally placed the suspect in the rear of a patrol vehicle.

Deputies later found McBrayer unresponsive and called for EMS.

EMS arrived, but could not revive McBrayer, and he was pronounced dead.

His body was taken to the GBI Macon Crime Lab where an autopsy will be performed.

The GBI will continue its independent investigation, which will be provided to the Tift Judicial Circuit for review.
