A Polk County deputy was taken off duty Saturday after fatally shooting a woman who was armed with a knife, officials said.

Miriam Ann Savino called 911 about 1:30 p.m. and told a dispatcher her son needed help then she hung up, according to the Polk County Sheriff’s Office.

The dispatcher tried to call her back several times then Savino called 911 again and said her son needed to be taken to the hospital and it was “a matter of life or death,” said Donna Wood, a Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman.

Deputy David Lockard responded to Savino’s Hastings Road home in a rural area near Lake Wales but didn’t find an emergency. It’s unclear if Savino has a son or whether he was inside the home during the incident.

That’s when Lockard says Savino pulled out a knife, Wood said. It’s unclear if she threatened him with the weapon. Wood said that is still under investigation.

The deputy opened fire and shot her. “He was in fear for his life,” Wood said.

He gave her first aid ahead of medical crews arriving, Wood said.

Savino, 53, was airlifted to Orlando Regional Medical Center where she later died.

Lockard has been taken off duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation.

Savino has been arrested five times in Polk County since 2004.

No other details about the shooting were available.
