CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) -- A man was found guilty of vehicular homicide in an accident that killed his pregnant girlfriend.

Merle A. Shank, 35, of Cedar Rapids, was convicted Thursday by a Linn County District Court jury of vehicular homicide by attempting to elude authorities, vehicular homicide by reckless driving and nonconsensual termination of a pregnancy.

He had claimed his girlfriend, Katrina Starr Nelson, 24, was behind the wheel on April 9 when the truck the two were riding in sped away from a sheriff's deputy, crashed and then rolled. Two other passengers were also in the vehicle, authorities said.

Prosecutors argued that Shank was driving.

"Mr. Shank is disappointed in the jury's verdict, however, we respect it," said Shank's attorney, Mike Lahammer.

Nelson's mother, Rox Nelson of Mount Pleasant, said after the trial that she was pleased with the guilty verdicts. She said Shank had her convinced for about a month that her daughter was the driver.

"He lied to me. I'm glad he didn't get by with lying," Rox Nelson said.

"This does give me some peace of mind. Justice was done," she added.

Shank faces up to 25 years in prison on the charges, including time for being a habitual offender since he has two or more prior felony convictions.

A sentencing date was not set.
