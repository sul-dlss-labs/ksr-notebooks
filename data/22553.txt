We now know what happened in the final moments of Monday's deadly shooting and stand-off in Evansville.

Police say 39-year-old Steve Rickard shot 28-year-old Jennifer Nicky Peters inside a Vann Avenue home, and held police at bay for hours. He was eventually shot by SWAT team officers.

The standoff lasted approximately six hours, but police chief Brad Hill says that was appropriate given the severity of the situation.

Hill says as always, their goal was that Rickard would give himself up on his own accord.

Hill says, "Our actions are completely dependant on the suspect complying and surrendering at our orders. That didn't happen in this case."

Hill says they already knew Peters was dead, and Rickard did send out the other person in the home, his elderly mother, shortly after he began communication with negotiators.

According to a police report, Rickard admitted to killing Peters.

Hill says SWAT teams were sent in and eventually were forced to fire on Rickard, killing him. He says that was exactly what the situation merited.

Hill says, "Every indication is that this was a very appropriate shooting and - as we said - this wasn't the way we wanted it to end - but the officers stopped the threat, which is what they're trained to do. I have nothing but positive remarks for the professional, well trained officers in handling this situation."

Crews say crime scene officials returned to the home on Tuesday to continue investigating, including taking inventory of the different types of weapons Rickard had in his possession.

Police say the two boys, ages 6 and 12, were Peters' sons. They are safe and staying with family.

Any officer who was directly involved with Rickard during this process are required to take at least three days off, and will undergo counseling.

Here is a timeline of what happened:

--The first call to 911 came in at 3:31 p.m. The caller told dispatch two young boys claimed their mother had been shot in the head.

--At 3:34 p.m., Officer Matt Hastings arrived at 1909 Vann Avenue. Police say that's when Rickard came out of his home carrying two guns and fired at Officer Hastings who returned fire. Police say he hit Rickard in the abdomen and Rickard went back inside. Within fifteen minutes, police say other officers arrived and nearby residents were evacuated.

--At 4:20 p.m., police say Rickard allowed his elderly mother to leave the home.

--About two hours later, police say they lost communication with Rickard and sent a robot with a camera inside to find him. They say they saw him in the bathroom with multiple weapons.

--At 8:30 p.m., police say they deployed tear gas into the home.

--At 9:25 p.m. SWAT teams enter the residence, believing Rickard is dead or hurt. Police say they fired at Rickard when he moved toward his gun.

--At 10:30 p.m., Vanderburgh County Coroner Annie Groves confirmed that Rickard was dead.
