A 28-year-old man was killed in a shootout with police officers early Sunday in Munster, Indiana, police said.

He was identified as Mark Bivins of Lansing, Illinois, by the Lake County coroner’s office said.

About 1:40 a.m. Dyer officers attempted to stop a black Dodge Charger near US Route 30 and Hart Street, but the driver disregarded officers and fled northbound, Munster police said.

The driver lost control of the vehicle, left the roadway and rolled over as officers prepared to use a tire deflation device near Columbia Avenue and Calumet, police said.

Officers chased the vehicle’s two occupants as they fled on foot, police said. One person was stopped and taken into custody, police said.

The other occupant, Bivins, continued to flee and shot at officers, who returned fire, striking and killing him, police said.

The Northwest Indiana Major Crimes Task Force is investigating the shooting.
