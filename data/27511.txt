HAMPTON, Va. -- A driver was killed and his passenger was critically injured after a high-speed chase along I-64 in Hampton Friday night.

Virginia State Police officials said a trooper spotted a car speeding with no headlights just before 10:30 p.m.

When the trooper tried to pull over the driver, officials said he refused to stop and sped up.

Troopers said the driver continued east at speeds over 100 mph, but lost control when he tried to take the Mallory Street exit.

Troopers said the vehicle overturned several times in the crash, killing 23-year-old Robert Lee Ham II of Newport News. He was not wearing his seat belt, officials said.

The passenger, a Hampton man, was ejected from the vehicle. He was taken to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Troopers said they do not yet know if alcohol was a factor in the crash, which remains under investigation.
