A member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians was killed in an incident with a police officer on the reservation.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, Jordan Willis , 30, was shot and an officer was stabbed.

The officer was treated for injuries and is expected to recover. The tribe said the FBI has been called in to investigate.

A commenter on The Neshoba Democrat's Facebook page indicated the shooting was unjustified. The commenter said she was the one who called tribal police to the scene for a "different matter."

"The office[r] didn't have to point & shoot him in the face twice!!" the commenter stated.

Johanna Willis, Kevin's sister, lashed out at tribal police on her Facebook page as well. She said her brother was shot twice, echoing the statement made by the other commenter. She also said he was shot after he already went "down."

Johanna later apologized to the family of the officer who was injured and said she was hopeful for his recovery.
