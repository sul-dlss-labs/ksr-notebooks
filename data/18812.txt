South Carolina murder suspect killed in shootout with NC troopers in Robeson County

A murder suspect is dead after a police chase that began in South Carolina ended about seven miles into North Carolina on Interstate 95 Friday morning.

The North Carolina Highway Patrol said it was asked to assist the Robeson County Sheriff's Office in the pursuit around 7:15 a.m. Friday.

The Highway Patrol said it made several attempts to stop the suspect's vehicle.

The suspect was identified as 22-year-old Jamake Cason Thomas, a murder suspect wanted in Marlboro County, SC.

"Once the vehicle stopped, an armed confrontation ensued and the suspect died on the scene," said a spokesperson in a news release.

The State Bureau of Investigation is looking into the shooting, which is standard protocol after any officer-involved shooting. The two troopers involved will be placed on administrative duty, which is also standard. They were identified as Trooper Douglas Strickland and Trooper Henry Locklear, both assigned to Robeson County.

Troopers said a weapon was found in Thomas's vehicle.

WPDE-TV reports that a woman was murdered in Marlboro County near the North Carolina border earlier Friday, but it wasn't immediately confirmed that the two event were related.
