A former Totowa police officer was killed after he ran his car into his former girlfriend and her attorney in a borough court parking lot tonight and was then shot by a pursuing police officer, authorities said.

Peter Riva, 60, of Totowa, died shortly after 10 p.m., according to Bill Maer, spokesman for the Passaic County Sheriff's Department.

Officer John Sole, 40, a 14-year veteran of the Totowa force, was shot in the shoulder around 8:15 p.m. in the area of Totowa Road and Mitchell Avenue, Passaic County Prosecutor James Avigliano said.

In the exchange of gunfire, Riva fired six times and Sole fired three times, the prosecutor said.

Riva and Sole were each struck once and both taken to St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center in Paterson, Maer said.

Sole's injuries were not considered life-threatening, authorities said.

The incident began when Riva struck the two pedestrians in the municipal court parking lot, the prosecutor said. Their injuries were not considered serious, Avigliano added.

Riva then drove about three blocks before exchanging fire with the police officer, Avigliano said. Riva shot first and Sole returned fire, according to Maer.

He did not know if Riva and his former girlfriend were in court earlier today for the same case.
