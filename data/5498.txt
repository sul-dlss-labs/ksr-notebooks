Perry Simmons

The splintered wood on the curb of South Holt Street is among the only remaining signs of a struggle that led to a man's death Friday. Police say they were called to 1517 Holt Street to remove 35-year-old Perry Simmons.

Homeowner Willie Crawford says Simmons was hanging out with one of his stepsons at his house when suddenly, Simmons became violent.

Crawford says, "I looked at him and I said, 'you all go ahead and call the police.'"

After they arrived, police say Simmons was so combative, they had to use mace and a taser to restrain him. Even then, Crawford says, it took as many as six officers to physically bring Simmons into custody.

Crawford says, "The sergeant was standing right [in front of my house] and they were dragging [Simmons] and he said, 'Pick him up and tote him. Don't drag him.' So, they picked him up and he was cussing going out to the car. He was kicking and everything."

Police say Simmons began to have trouble breathing when they were taking him to headquarters. Paramedics there rushed him to Jackson Hospital where doctors later pronounced Simmons dead.

Simmons' body will undergo an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Crawford says he called police to prevent something terrible from happening in the first place, but even in light of this tragedy, he thinks it was the right decision.

Crawford adds, "The only thing I can say is, I don't see where the police did anything wrong. They did what they had to do."

The Alabama Bureau of Investigation will look into the arrest.
