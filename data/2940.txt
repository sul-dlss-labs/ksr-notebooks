Three die in fiery crash after police chase

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Three people, including a pregnant woman, were killed Friday in a fiery crash after a high-speed pursuit east of downtown Los Angeles, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said.

Officers were pursuing an allegedly stolen Chevrolet Tahoe on surface streets in the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles when the sport utility vehicle ran a red light and collided with a United Parcel Service tractor-trailer cab, Officer Francisco Villalobos said.

The UPS cab then crashed into a gas pump, causing an explosion and fire, Villalobos said. The cab was not carrying a trailer.

Police said the driver of the SUV was pronounced dead at the scene. A male and female passenger were taken to Los Angeles County Medical Center, where they were pronounced dead. The female was pregnant, and her unborn child did not survive.

The third passenger, a male, was taken to Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena. No information on his condition was available.

The driver of the UPS vehicle sustained minor injuries and was taken to a nearby hospital, Villalobos said.
