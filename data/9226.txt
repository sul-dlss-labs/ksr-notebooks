Daniel Garcia, a 32-year-old Latino, was shot to death by Montebello police Sunday, June 20, in the 500 block of Emmet Williams Way in Montebello, according to Los Angeles County coroner's records.

Police responded to a call of a robbery about 6:25 p.m., according to a sheriff's news release. The caller described the robbery suspect as a Latino, wearing a white T-shirt and black pants, last seen running north on 6th Street from Whittier Boulevard, authorities said. The caller reported that a citizen was following the suspect.

Officers located the alleged assailant, later identified by the coroner's office as Garcia, and requested back-up. Garcia was seen running south on 6th Street and then eastbound on Emmett-Williams Way, according to the news release.

Police began to chase Garcia on foot and were directed by citizens to a side yard where it was believed Garcia was hiding. Authorities said police gave specific commands to Garcia and told him to lie down on the ground, but he allegedly attacked the officers while holding a knife in his right hand.

Verbal commands were given again and he refused to follow them, according to the news release. Two officers used their Taser weapons, striking Garcia. According to the Sheriff's Department, Garcia did not stop and continued to go after the officers, holding the knife in front of him.

Fearing for their safety, the two officers fired their duty weapons, striking Garcia in the upper torso, according to the news release.

Montebello City Fire Department paramedics responded to the scene, and Garcia was pronounced dead, authorities said.

No officers were injured in the incident.

After the shooting, investigators said they recovered a large bladed folding knife, as well as evidence linking Garcia to the robbery, at the scene.
