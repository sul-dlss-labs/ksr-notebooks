SAN BERNARDINO >> A man allegedly holding a woman at knifepoint in front of his two children was shot and killed by a San Bernardino police officer late Saturday morning.

The unidentified 49-year-old man was taken to a hospital where he later died, said Sgt. Vicki Cervantes.

The man, allegedly armed with the knife, had reportedly gotten into an argument with a neighbor just before 11:30 a.m. in the 500 block of Tia Juana Street, she said. The neighbor managed to flag down an officer and told the officer the knife-wielding man had run into a nearby home where two women and the man’s children were staying, officials said.

“As (the officer) was walking toward the front door he had a clear visual of the suspect,” Cervantes said. “That suspect was holding a female in the residence with a knife in a threatening manner.”

“He was yielding the knife, waving it around, yelling something to the effect of ‘Shoot me! Shoot me!’” she said.

After the woman managed to free herself from her attacker, the officer shot the man after he allegedly continued to wave the knife around and refused to comply with the officer’s commands. No one else was hurt in the shooting.

Neighbor, Manuel Sanchez, identified the dead man only as Roy, adding that the home where the shooting took place was Roy’s mother-in-law’s house.

“That’s really sad,” said Sanchez who heard about four or five shots from his home.

It was not immediately clear if Roy was holding and threatening his wife or mother-in-law.

Cervantes said it was unclear what sparked the initial argument, but did say that the 49-year-old had used the knife to stab at the vehicle of the man who flagged down the officer.

Homicide detectives are investigating the incident.
