A passenger in a small car died following a single-vehicle crash east of Jacksonville early Wednesday morning.

The vehicle, a Mini Cooper, had been involved in a brief pursuit on East Morton Avenue with Morgan County Sheriff’s deputies.

Coroner Marcy Patterson pronounced Joshua Gordley, 19, of Jacksonville, dead at the accident scene near Old Route 36 and Witty Road. The driver of the vehicle, a 19-year-old from Missouri whose name had not been released, was treated at Memorial Medical Center.

The accident occurred about 3:15 a.m.

Sheriff Mike Carmody, reached Wednesday night, said deputies had clocked the vehicle for speeding shortly before 3 a.m. It initially slowed down when deputies activated their flashing lights.

Carmody said the driver of the vehicle did “a 180” and continued in an eastward direction. Deputies gave a brief pursuit, but stopped when the driver turned off its car lights.

Carmody said the driver hit a gravel area at a high rate of speed, exited Old 36 and wound up traveling parallel to a set of railroad tracks before striking a utility pole.

An Air Evac medical team was initially called to the scene, but canceled. South Jacksonville Police and Fire also responded.

An Illinois State Police accident reconstruction team was on the scene. Old 36 was closed for several hours Wednesday morning.

The crash is under investigation.
