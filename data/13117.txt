Juan Diaz Chavez, a 37-year-old white man, was fatally shot by police Tuesday, July 16, in the 1800 block of West Pico Boulevard in Pico-Union, according to L.A. County coroner’s records.

Plainclothes officers, later identified as Fernando Flores and Alfredo Aguayo, were in an unmarked car monitoring a nearby vigil shortly before 9 p.m., when they saw Chavez cross the street and walk toward them, according to an LAPD news release.

Chavez appeared to stare at the officers as he walked toward the vehicle, and as he passed, he reached into his waistband, according to the release.

The officers got out of their car, drew their weapons and identified themselves as police. Chavez removed a blue steel revolver from his waistband and was shot, according to the Police Department.

Officers said that after the shooting, a muzzle flash and gunfire erupted from the area of the vigil and could have been directed toward them, according to the department.

Chavez was pronounced dead at 10:34 p.m., according to coroner’s records.

Police recovered a blue steel .357 caliber Taurus revolver and six empty casings inside the cylinder of the gun.

Anyone with information about the incident can call the force investigation division at (213) 486-5230. Those who wish to remain anonymous can call Crime Stoppers at (800) 222-8477.
