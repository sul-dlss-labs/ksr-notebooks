Police officers involved in the shooting death of a man outside an Evans pool hall have been cleared by the Weld County district attorney of criminal wrongdoing.

Michael Ray Rodriguez was shot by police Jan. 4 outside Paradise Billiards, 818 31st St., after officers were called on a report of a “man armed with a gun threatening bar patrons and assaulting his girlfriend,” the DA’s office said Wednesday in a news release.

When officers arrived, Rodriguez pointed “what appeared to be a handgun at the officers” and refused officers’ commands to drop the weapon, said the DA’s office.

Eleven rounds were fired by two officers, one from the Evans Police Department and the other from the La Salle Police Department. Four bullets struck Rodriguez. He was holding a Hilti nail gun when shot by officers.

District Attorney Michael Rourke “deemed the officers’ actions justified and declined to file criminal charges because they reasonably believed it was necessary to defend themselves and others from Mr. Rodriguez’s threatened use of deadly physical force,” the release said.

The complete report is posted on the website of the Weld County district attorney.
