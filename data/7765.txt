The annual News10‚Äùs Coats for Kids drive has begun! ATA Martial Arts is supporting this effort, and will be acting as a drop-off location for any new or gently used coat. Every person or family that donates a coat will receive 30 free days of martial arts training at participating ATA Martial Arts locations.

Donations will be accepted through Dec. 15. Coats will be distributed on Dec. 30, from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. at Cal Expo. The local drop off location is Kincannons ATA Martial Arts, 20 N. East St. No. 104, Woodland Call. 669-7810 for information.
