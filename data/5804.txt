The day after a disturbed man died after being shocked with a Taser stun gun in Queens by a police sergeant, a city police official yesterday provided a fuller account of the moments before the man apparently went into cardiac arrest.

The man, Blondel Lassegue, 38, a former schoolteacher, struggled with the police on Sunday afternoon in a kitchen of a house near Kennedy International Airport. Family members at the house said late yesterday that they would issue a statement today about the circumstances of Mr. Lassegue’s death.

The Nassau County medical examiner’s office, which is investigating the death, said the cause had not been determined.

The sergeant who shot Mr. Lassegue appeared to have been following departmental guidelines, said Chief Michael Collins, a New York Police Department spokesman. The Taser is widely used by police departments to subdue people, although there have been questions about its safety. Amnesty International says more than 220 people have died after being shot by Tasers.
