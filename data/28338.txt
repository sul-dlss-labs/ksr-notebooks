A Montgomery County Sheriff’s Office detective observed a black Ford 500 being driven on Needmore Road about 3:45 p.m. June 25, according to the sheriff’s office.

The Ford 500 had been reported as stolen in an aggravated robbery in Dayton on Wednesday and was verified by the sheriff’s office as stolen.

The detective observed the vehicle stopped to turn onto North Dixie Drive from a parking lot just north of Needmore where a marked sheriff’s car approached the Ford with lights and siren activated. The detective’s car, which had its emergency lights activated, was struck by the Ford and pushed back.

The stolen vehicle then fled south on North Dixie Drive and was pursued by several marked sheriff’s cars.

The pursuit continued south on North Dixie Drive when the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to cross the northbound lanes of North Dixie and hit a house at the corner of North Dixie Drive and Hillsdale Avenue.

The driver, whose name has not been released, fled the crashed vehicle but was detained a short time later. The other two passengers were taken to local hospitals, where their conditions are not known.

The intersection of North Dixie Drive at Hillsdale Avenue was closed to Neff Road for several hours for the accident investigation.
