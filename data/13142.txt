SMITHFIELD, N.C. — The State Bureau of Investigation has identified a suspect killed in an officer-involved shooting over the weekend after he allegedly robbed a Smithfield convenience store and carjacked someone before leading authorities on a chase that ended in Wilson County.

Jennifer Canada, a spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Justice, identified the man in Sunday morning's shooting as Garrett Nelson Brooks, 28, of Roanoke Rapids.

Canada said Monday that the SBI was called in to investigate the case – a normal procedure whenever a law enforcement officer is involved in a shooting – at the request of the Wilson County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities said Sunday that the chase ended on N.C. Highway 42, near Interstate 95, following a robbery at Kangaroo Express, at 1137 N. Bright Leaf Blvd. in Smithfield, and a robbery and carjacking in the parking lot of American Pride Car Wash, also on North Bright Leaf Boulevard.

According to a police report, a Wilson County sheriff's vehicle was significantly damaged, as well as the SUV Brooks allegedly stole at the car wash and had been driving.

Two deputies, John Harris, 30, of the Wilson County Sheriff's Office, and Robert Raetz, 41, of the Johnston County Sheriff's Office, were identified as being involved in the shooting.

Brooks' criminal record includes several misdemeanor charges in North Carolina in 2003 and 2005, but all of them were voluntarily dismissed.

Virginia court records, however, indicate that he was released from prison on Nov. 27, 2012, after serving 3.5 years on several burglary and grand larceny charges from 2007 until 2010.
