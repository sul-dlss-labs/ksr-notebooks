An off-duty Harvey police officer shot two men, killing one, during what police describe as an attempted robbery early Friday morning in Chicago.

Nigel Syers, 28, of the 6200 block of South Harper Avenue was pronounced dead at 4:30 a.m. in the Cook County medical examiner's office, a spokesman said.

Police said Syers and the other suspect approached the officer, who was in a car, and another man, who was standing next to the car, at about 1 a.m. Friday in the 9100 block of South Ada Street and demanded valuables.

As they began taking money and jewelry from the man who was standing, one of the suspects drew a handgun, police said.

The off-duty officer identified himself and exited the vehicle when the suspect turned the gun at him, according to police.

The Harvey officer, whose name was not released, shot the suspect four times and shot the other alleged offender once in the abdomen, police said.

The wounded suspect is in fair condition at Christ Hospital and Medical Center in Oak Lawn, a hospital spokesman said. He has not yet been charged with a crime, said Chicago police spokesman Robert Cargie.
