(Shreveport-AP) -- A Shreveport police officer, who shot and killed an alleged prowler last year, has been cleared of any criminal wrongdoing.

On November 23rd, investigators say Officer Terrance Lesane and LSU Health Sciences Center police officer Lisa Booth responded to a 911 call and found a man had broken into a home in Shreveport. During a struggle, the suspect, 43-year-old Anthony Jamison, reportedly grabbed officer Booth's gun.

Caddo Parish District Attorney Paul Carmouche says an investigation revealed Jamison discharged the weapon but did not shoot anyone. Lesane fired a single shot from his weapon, killing Jamison. Carmouche ruled the killing a justifiable homicide. He say Lesane's actions were both reasonable and necessary.
