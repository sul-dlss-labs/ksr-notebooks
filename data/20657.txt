A Northeast Philadelphia standoff ended in a man taking his own life early this morning.

The man, 28, barricaded himself inside his home on the 9400 block of Bustleton Avenue in what began as a domestic incident. He was arguing with a girlfriend when he pulled out a gun and possibly fired it into the air to scare her, a police spokeswoman said.

The girlfriend ran outside and called police around 6:30 p.m., causing SWAT teams to surround the house for seven hours with the man alone inside.

He killed himself in the home shortly before 1:25 a.m. His identity is unknown, as police do not release the names of suicide victims.

No one else was injured.
