LANSING -- The Lansing Police Department has fired one of its patrol officers for his involvement in a February crash that killed a Mt. Morris man.

Johnnie W. Torres Jr. was fired Tuesday after 14 years as a Lansing police officer.

"Mr. Torres is a good man who made poor choices and now is being held accountable for those choices," said Lansing police Chief Mark Alley in a prepared statement.Torres was charged with misdemeanor drunken driving after a Feb. 5 crash at the southbound I-475 exit ramp to Clio Road.

Torres was southbound on Clio Road in Mt. Morris Township when Mark A. Kline, 42, ran a stop sign at the exit ramp, police said.

Kline died at the scene.

Tests allegedly showed that both Torres and Kline had been drinking and had blood-alcohol levels above the legal limit for driving.

The Genesee County Prosecutor's Office declined to bring more serious charges against Torres because it was determined he had the right of way and did not cause the crash.

Torres could face up to 93 days in jail, plus driver's license restrictions and various fines and costs, if convicted on the drunken driving charge.

Torres, who lives in the Flushing area, was placed on administrative leave after the crash.

In his statement, Alley said Lansing police "cannot tolerate this type of conduct from any of its members."

Torres' attorney could not be reached for comment Wednesday afternoon.
