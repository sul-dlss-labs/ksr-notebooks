A 30-year-old man was shot and killed during an altercation with Cobb County police Friday morning.

John Allen Massey was shot by an officer during an altercation outside an extended-stay hotel in the 2200 block of Powers Ferry Road, Officer Mike Bowman with Cobb police said Friday night.

Officers were at the hotel after a stolen motorcycle was located in the parking lot, Bowman said.

“During the investigation, officers came into contact with the perpetrator in room 345,” Bowman said in an emailed statement. “A physical altercation ensued and the perpetrator produced a handgun, which immediately caused the officers to be in fear for their lives.”

An officer, whose name was not released, fired at the suspect, later identified as Massey, Bowman said. Massey died at the scene.

At the time of his death, Massey was a registered sex offender following a 2001 conviction on rape charges, according to the GBI. He was released from prison in October 2011 after serving a year for failing to update his address information as a sex offender, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections.

The officers involved in the incident have been placed on routine administrative leave pending an internal investigation. Anyone with information on the case is asked to call police at 770-499-3945.
