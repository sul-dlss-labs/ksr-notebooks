Sheriff’s deputies shot and killed a 63-year-old man Saturday afternoon after a short pursuit that ended when he emerged from his car at a Compton truck yard and opened fire at them, according to the Sheriff’s Department.

Deputies responding to a call of gunshots fired on South Butler Avenue began pursuing Thomas Jones, a Carson resident. After Jones ran a few red lights, he got out of his car and started firing at deputies with a high-powered rifle, officials said.

Deputies shot Jones several times and he died later at a hospital, the department said. No deputies were injured.
