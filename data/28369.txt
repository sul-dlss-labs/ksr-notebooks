UPDATE: A man who police had said shot and wounded himself during a SWAT standoff earlier this week died Friday morning from his injuries, authorities said.

The man was identified by police as 34-year-old Ivan Zubiate.

In a twist, authorities said Friday it had been determined that the man didn't actually shoot himself, but rather had multiple self-inflicted knife wounds to his neck and arms.

ORIGINAL REPORT: EL PASO, Texas -- An armed man who barricaded himself into a home in a residential neighborhood on El Paso's west side Wednesday after shots were fired, was taken into custody a couple of hours later and was being treated for what police said were self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

The police standoff took place in the 6300 block of Casper Ridge, where officers were initially dispatched about 12:15 p.m. for a "wanted subject."

Authorities deployed a SWAT team to the neighborhood about an hour later after police said the man had fired shots and apparently wounded himself.

"Subject armed with a rifle has shot himself but still mobile inside residence and refusing to surrender," a police spokesman tweeted.

A bit more than two hours after events began unfolding, police said they had finally taken the man into custody and he was being treated for the self-inflicted gunshot wounds.

No further details were immediately provided.
