SHARE Orlando Dixson Michael Bartleson Peter Biljak

By Matt Lakin

When deputies arrived at a West Knox County home Saturday, an angry man with a shotgun met them at the door, authorities say.

Peter George Biljak, 61, died Saturday night after he greeted two officers by waving a 12-gauge pump shotgun at the doorway of his home, 8512 Nubbin Ridge Road, Knox County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Martha Dooley said Monday.

Deputies Michael Bartleson and Orlando Dixson had gone to the house just before 6 p.m. on a disturbance call. A woman, Mary Beth Norris, had called E-911 to report Biljak sent her a text message threatening to burn her belongings, Dooley said.

"She told the officers that Biljak had an alcohol and drug problem and was suicidal," Dooley said.

The deputies walked to the door, shouting that they were officers. Biljak came to the door and refused to drop the shotgun, despite repeated orders from the deputies, Dooley said.

Biljak pointed the shotgun at Dixson, and the officers fired, Dooley said. He died at the scene.

Biljak had worked for Oak Ridge National Laboratory from March 2007 to September 2011, when his job was cut, ORNL spokesman David Keim said. He was classified as a "technical professional," which typically refers to engineering work.

Court records show Biljak had been arrested twice for driving under the influence in the past year â€” once in October and again in January. Deputies had visited the home at least twice in the past year to check on Biljak, Dooley said.

Autopsy results, including tests for drugs and alcohol, weren't complete Monday.

Norris said she didn't want to talk about what happened.

Bartleson, a past KCSO Officer of the Month, has worked as a deputy since November 1999. Dixson has worked as a deputy since 2010.

Both remain on paid leave.
