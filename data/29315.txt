FARMINGTON — Police shot and killed a driver who crashed into a patrol car and approached them with a weapon while they were investigating a different case in Farmington overnight, authorities said Sunday.

Farmington police and state troopers were looking into a report of a stolen vehicle about 2 a.m. when the 29-year-old man crashed his car into a Farmington patrol vehicle at 650 West and State Street in Farmington, the Utah Department of Public Safety said on its website.

The driver, who was armed, then advanced on the officers, according to the department.

“The driver failed to respond to verbal commands and deadly force was utilized,” the agency said. A trooper and a Farmington police office both fired at the man before rushing to revive him.

Detectives don’t believe there’s any link between the suspect who died and their initial investigation. His name has not yet been released pending notification of kin.

Crews took him to a hospital, where he succumbed to his injuries. It wasn’t immediately clear how many times he was shot or what sort of weapon he brandished.

No officers or troopers with the Utah Highway Patrol were injured.

Body cameras captured the shooting, and investigators with the Davis County Critical Incident Protocol Team will be reviewing the use of lethal force.
