The Lancaster County Coroner's Office has ruled the death of 65-year-old John Simson, who was fatally shot by a Manheim Township police officer Tuesday in front of the police station, a homicide.

Autopsy reports also indicate Simson had a self-inflicted gunshot wound, but the fatal wound came from the officer, LancasterOnline reports.

"He had a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his face that preceded the fatal wound fired by the police officer," said Lancaster County Coroner Dr. Stephen Diamantoni in the report.

Simson fired at least two shots from a shotgun, including one at himself, during the exchange that spanned a couple of minutes.

Simson was arraigned May 4 on charges of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse of a child, indecent assault of a child (three counts), unlawful contact with a minor and corruption of a minor.

The district attorney's office will make a determination on whether or not the officer's use of force was justified.
