SAN JOSE (CBS SF) -- Police in San Jose have identified a suspect killed in an officer-involved shooting Monday evening as 45-year-old Byron Rosas.

Rosas, a San Jose resident, was shot by 20-year-veteran Officer Don Guess while responding to a stabbing around 6:15 p.m. Monday in the vicinity of Third and Martha streets.

Rosas allegedly stabbed his estranged wife and her acquaintance. Guess found her laying face down on the ground in front of a home, and witnesses identified Rosas as the assailant, according to police.

Rosas faced Guess in a "very aggressive manner" while armed with a knife before walking back toward his residence. Guess ordered Rosas to drop the knife, then fired when Rosas failed to comply, police said.

Rosas was pronounced dead at the scene.

His wife and her acquaintance were transported to a hospital. She was treated and released, but he remained in critical condition as of Tuesday, according to police.

Investigators say that Rosas' and his wife had a temporary restraining order between them, though specifics about the order were not immediately available.

The shooting was not captured by body-worn cameras, police said. Guess has been placed on paid administrative leave while the fatal shooting is investigated.
