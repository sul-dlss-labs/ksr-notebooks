A Melrose Park man who was arrested Thursday as part of a yearlong drug investigation died at a hospital an hour after being taken into custody.

Jerome Gill, 31, of the 1700 block of First Avenue, was arrested near his home during a sting operation about 12:30 p.m. after he sold drugs to an undercover Cook County sheriff's police officer, authorities said.

Officers were about to apprehend Gill during the undercover buy but he fled and resisted arrest, said Liane Jackson, a spokeswoman for the sheriff's office. A Taser stun gun was fired at Gill, but it didn't appear to subdue him, Jackson said. He was later subdued by officers who pulled him to the ground and placed him under arrest, she said.

Gill then began spitting up pieces of crack cocaine that he may have ingested, Jackson said.

Gill was coherent and conversing with officers and paramedics and continued to speak with medical personnel at Gottlieb Memorial Hospital in Melrose Park but died about 1:30 p.m., Jackson said.

An official cause of death won't be determined until toxicology results are received in about eight weeks, a spokeswoman for the Cook County medical examiner's office said.

Jackson said she does not believe that the use of the Taser resulted in Gill's death.

"He didn't even respond to the Taser when it was being used on him," she said. "The hospital later told us that there were some pieces of rock cocaine in his system."

A relative of Gill's would not comment about the incident when reached by phone.
