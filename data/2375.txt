Thursday was unusually violent day for Montgomery Sheriffs Deputies. Two chases both ended with the drivers attempting to or taking their own lives.

What should have been a simple arrest, took a violent turn when Jesse Hamilton ran from deputies and apparently shot himself to death. Sheriff D.T. Marshall says the man had recently been fired from a trucking company and had reportedly been firing shots at his former employer.

Deputies went to serve an arrest warrant for harassment when they saw him drive by. He led them on a low speed chase through rural Montgomery County. Sheriff Marshall says he man shot himself in the head during the chase and his vehicle crashed into a nearby field.

Another man involved in a separate police chase is listed in serious condition at a Montgomery hospital. The chase happened around 6:30 Thursday morning in the Pike Road area. The sheriff's department says Wayne Ballenger crashed into another car at the intersection of Vaughn and Pike Roads. When deputies approached him, he began stabbing himself in the chest with a hunting knife saying he wanted to die.
