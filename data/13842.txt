GREEN BAY, Wis.—A Green Bay police officer, involved in his second deadly shooting, has been cleared by the Brown County district attorney.

Authorities say Officer Clint Beguhn fired ten rounds and killed 63-year-old Darold VandenHeuvel last month in the underground parking garage of an apartment where the man’s estranged wife lived.

WLUK-TV ( http://bit.ly/K8jwWX) reports Beguhn and another officer were called to the apartment and found VandenHeuvel in the garage with a gun. Beguhn told investigators he fired when VandenHeuvel reached for his gun.

Beguhn was also cleared in a deadly shooting outside the Packer Stadium Lounge in 2011. The officer can now return to street duty.
