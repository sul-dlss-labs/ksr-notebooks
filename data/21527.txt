An Upstate deputy has been charged in a crash that killed a college student, according to South Carolina Highway Patrol Corporal Bill Rhyne. Anderson County Deputy Timothy Ryan Chapman, 26, turned himself in to authorities Wednesday and is charged with reckless homicide, Rhyne said. Chapman was chasing a stolen vehicle July 23 on Highway 8 when his patrol car crashed into a car driven by 22-year-old Joshua Caleb Martin, according to officials. Troopers said Chapman’s car struck Martin's car on the passenger side, pinning him inside. Martin died at the scene. He was a Wren High School graduate and was attending Greenville Technical College at the time of his death. Anderson County Coroner Greg Shore said Martin had just left a nearby church after a meeting with the preacher when the crash happened.Anderson County authorities said the chase started after a report of a stolen vehicle at the 7-Eleven convenience store on Highway 8.Capt. Darrell Hill told WYFF News 4 that when deputies arrived at the store, they attempted to stop the stolen car, but the driver drove off, beginning the chase.Hill said when the chase reached the intersection of Highway 8 and Moore Road, the deputy's cruiser collided with Martin’s car.Martin’s car was not involved in the pursuit.The stolen vehicle was found the following day burning on Pine Road in Piedmont. Rhyne said troopers took the findings of the investigation to the Greenville County Solicitor’s Office. He said the findings showed sufficient evidence to support charging Chapman with reckless homicide.Chapman was reassigned to a detention officer after the crash, Anderson County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Nikki Carson said. Carson said he is now on leave pending an administrative hearing next week. Martin's mother, Teresa Bowen, told WYFF News 4's Mandy Gaither that the family is grateful to Solicitor Walt Wilkins for objectively reviewing the case. "We appreciate the work done by the highway patrol and Mait team and everyone involved in this process," Bowen said. Anderson County Sheriff Chad McBride said he's letting the judicial system take its course, but is praying for Bowen and the family."Josh was such a good kid, but on the same token, Ryan's been struggling with this, our deputy Ryan Chapman, and it's just a heartbreaking situation, certainly a tragedy."
