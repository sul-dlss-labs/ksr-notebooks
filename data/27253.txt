A suspect wanted in Burke County on aggravated stalking charges has died after apparently shooting himself during a standoff at an Augusta motel Tuesday night, authorities say.

Zad Kendrick Rouse, 46, was pronounced dead at 4:46 a.m. Wednesday at AU Medical Center, Richmond County Coroner Mark Bowen said in a release. Rouse will be sent to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation lab for an autopsy.

At 4 p.m., the Richmond County Sheriff’s Office was advised that Rouse, could be found at Knights Inn at 210 Boy Scout Road, according to a statement from the sheriff’s office.

After it was verified that Rouse was inside a motel room, deputies attempted to contact him. Rouse barricaded himself in the room, and Richmond County SWAT negotiators tried to contact him, the statement said.

After failed attempts, SWAT team members moved into the motel room, where Rouse was found with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the statement said.

Rouse had active warrants in Burke County for aggravated stalking, criminal damage to property and multiple weapons violations. The Burke County Sheriff’s Office said he was considered armed and dangerous.
