A 13-year-old boy was critically injured yesterday in Harlem when he ran into a street between parked cars and was struck by an unmarked police van, the authorities said. The boy, identified as Keith McKissick, underwent surgery last night at Harlem Hospital, a spokeswoman said. Two officers from the warrant squad were driving west on 125th Street near Madison Avenue shortly after 12:30 p.m. when the van's passenger-side mirror struck the boy in the head, the police said. A videotape obtained from a shopkeeper and shown to reporters last night showed that the van had a green light and stopped when the boy was hit.
