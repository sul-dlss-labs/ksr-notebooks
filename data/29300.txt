The man shot and killed during a standoff with law enforcement in Cass County has been identified as Eric Drake Feenstra, 47, according to a news release from the Cass County Attorney's Office.

Feenstra has ties to both San Antonio and Rockwall, Texas.

Feenstra had been the subject of a manhunt late Wednesday and early Thursday near the Huffines area after he allegedly was robbing people at gunpoint, according to the Cass County Sheriff's Office. Feenstra allegedly fired shots at law enforcement during the search.

At 1 p.m. Thursday, the suspect was found in a small maintenance shop and refused to surrender. During negotiations, the suspect showed a weapon, according to a news release from Shelton, and was shot by law enforcement. He died at the scene.

No officers or civilians were injured.

The case remains under investigation by the Texas Rangers.

The Texas Department of Public Safety, Cass County Sheriff's Office and Atlanta and Queen City Police Departments had been looking for the suspect overnight Wednesday. Texas Parks and Wildlife Game Wardens assisted in the search also along with the Telford Unit canine department.

"We sincerely thank all of these agencies for their long hours of work and efforts to ensure the safety of the community which they all took very seriously," Shelton said.
