COCOA — A Brevard County sheriff’s deputy fatally shot a man who fired shots into the deputy’s vehicle.

The shooting happened Monday night, following reports that someone was firing a gun into homes and cars in Cocoa.

Sheriff Wayne Ivey says the deputy spotted someone fitting the description of the gunman and before he could get out of the car, the man fired into the car.

He says the deputy took cover and returned fire.

The gunman was taken to the hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The suspect was identified as 30-year-old Cedrick Lamont Bishop of Cocoa.

“Bishop has an extensive and violent criminal history,” the Sheriff’s Office said in a statement.

His past includes a prison sentence in 2007 for burglary, attempted robbery and cocaine charges.

The Florida Department of Law Enforcement is investigating.
