TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has confirmed the suspect from an deputy-involved shooting Tuesday night has died.

Nanos said Marcos Antonio Gastelum died at a local hospital after being shot by Deputy Koby Knodle. The shooting happened on the southwest side of Tucson, near the area of Floyd Street and Leonard Avenue.

According to Nanos, the 26-year-old Knodle responded to a call around 7:20 p.m. about a person in a vehicle taking pictures of kids in the area and trying to lure them into a car.

Knodle, who has been with the PCSD for three years, spotted the suspect's vehicle and attempted to stop it. The driver of the vehicle, Gastelum, did not comply and continued down the street before finally stopping in a driveway.

Knodle and the 25-year-old Gastelum got out of their vehicles and Gastelum began attacking the deputy, according to Nanos. Knodle then discharged his weapon and struck Gastelum.

Knodle suffered a head injury and was treated and released from a local hospital.

According to the Pima County Consolidated Justice Court Record, Gastelum has a lengthy criminal history. He had pleaded guilty to assault, marijuana possession, underage drinking and criminal damage in the past.
