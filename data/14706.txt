The officer involved in the shooting that killed a knife-wielding woman early Wednesday morning has been identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as Officer Sergio MPhillips.

Officers responded to Manor Suites, 7230 S. Las Vegas Blvd., where they found Mimi Goldberg, 49, on a second-floor balcony holding a knife. She slashed a window screen and officers ordered her to stop, Deputy Chief Kirk Primas said.

Officers went upstairs where they found Goldberg stabbing a woman inside the apartment, Primas said.

When Goldberg did not obey police commands, MPhillips fired, hitting her “several times” before she fled to the bathroom and locked herself in, according to Primas.

Officers were able to get into the bathroom, and Goldberg was taken to University Medical Center, where she died about three hours later.

Primas said the woman who was stabbed suffered superficial injuries and was treated at the scene. Three young children in the apartment were not harmed.

MPhillips, 32, has been with the department since 2005 and is assigned to the Homeland Security Saturation Team. He is currently on paid administrative leave.
