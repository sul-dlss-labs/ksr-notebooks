Eighteen-month-old Katherine Phan

of Stockton was listening to her father sing karaoke shortly before he beheaded

her with a meat cleaver in June.

Valdez Franklin, 28, was killed

in a shootout with a Stockton storeowner he was trying to rob on Valentine's

Day. Alfonso Martinez, 20, was robbed and gunned down as he walked with his

girlfriend on an October evening in Stockton's American Legion Park.

These are just three of the 65 people

whose slayings at the hands of others were reported or discovered in San Joaquin

County in 2003, six more than the year before. Most of the county's slain were

men who were shot to death, and the average age of those killed was 32. Female

victims made up only 17 percent of the total. Among the dead also were three

babies, four people 72 or older and 10 teens.

Twenty-five of the 65 slayings remain

unsolved.

The majority of the county's homicides

occurred in Stockton, which also experienced the biggest jump in numbers. Stockton

police handled 42 homicides in 2003, compared with 36 the prior year. Over the

past decade, the number of Stockton's annual homicides peaked at 46 in 1996

and then dropped to 27 in 1998.

Stockton's total for 2003 is slightly

skewed, because it includes two homicides that occurred as long as 12 years

ago, Stockton police spokesman Officer Sean Fenner said. Federal and local authorities

dug up the skeletal remains of two adults Dec. 18 in a back yard at a home on

South Lincoln Street after receiving a tip that two Mexican immigrants had been

killed and buried there a decade ago. Their identities have not been confirmed.

The California Department of Justice, which tracks homicide statistics, told

police the slayings had to be included in 2003's tally, Fenner said.

"If you look at the total without

the bones and the officer-involved shooting, we would be at 39," Fenner said.

In 2003, there also were two homicides

in Manteca, two in Tracy, one in Lodi and one in Ripon.

The following is a list of the 65

people slain or reported slain in San Joaquin County in 2003:

CLARIFICATION

The above story comparing

the number of homicides in 2002 and 2003 that ran Jan. 4 on Page A1 contained

incorrect information about the number of homicides in 2002. The Department

of Justice provided incorrect statistics for 2002; the total did not include

officer-involved slayings. The number of homicides in Stockton in 2002 was

38, including three people shot by Stockton police, according to police department

statistics. In 2003, there were 42 slayings, including one officer-involved

shooting. The increase in homicides from 2002 to 2003 was about 10 percent.
