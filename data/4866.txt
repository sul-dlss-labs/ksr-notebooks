There is another child without a father today. Searchers pulled the body of new father, 22-year-old Scott Thompson, out of Pintlala Creek shortly after noon Friday.

Scott Thompson's family tells WSFA that Scott and his brother, Shane, were scouting some land for hunting off the Old Selma Road. For some unknown reason, the two men saw a game warden, got nervous and tried to cross Pintlala Creek.

The chief investigator for the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office, Lt. Rufus Haralson, tells WSFA the land owner spotted the two men on the land and called the game warden. "The game warden came up on them and they took off running and decided to swim across the creek. One made it; one did not."

The investigator says he doesn't know why the young men ran. "They probably just didn't want to get caught."

Shane Thompson tried, without success, to save his brother, Scott. According to the boys' father, Scott could swim.

As to what caused the drowning, there are several possibilities. "He could have caught a cramp or anything, but the water's really colder than the actual temperature, so I think the weather did have some contributing factor to it... The water is not that deep, but there's a whole lot of debris in the little creek," says Haralson.

ABI agents and Lowndes County sheriff's deputies were on the scene and a dive team from Montgomery searched for and recovered the body.
