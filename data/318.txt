A day after two off-duty police officers shot and killed an unarmed man in an unusual rush-hour confrontation on a Queens highway, the authorities said yesterday that they could not explain why the man had leapt from a car into fast-moving traffic and then attacked the officers.

The investigation into the shooting focused on whether the two officers were justified in firing their weapons at the man, Dandre Darnell Cisco, 25. He was shot and killed at about 6:20 p.m. on Friday, in an eastbound lane of Grand Central Parkway near Francis Lewis Boulevard, officials said.

But the authorities also were trying to determine why Mr. Cisco, a chef from Glen Cove, N.Y., with no previous criminal record, jumped from a friend's car as it was moving at about 40 miles per hour on a busy highway, rolled along the pavement, then jumped up and attacked the two off-duty officers in their pickup truck. The two officers, who were not in uniform, had stopped the truck because they thought Mr. Cisco was an accident victim, officials said.

''It's all very strange,'' said a senior police official who is involved in the investigation, being conducted by the Police Department's Internal Affairs Bureau, the Queens Homicide Squad and the Queens district attorney. ''It's like something out of the 'Twilight Zone.' ''
