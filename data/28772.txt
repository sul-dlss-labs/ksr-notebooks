FAYETTE COUNTY, Tenn. — The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation was called Thursday morning to the scene of an officer-involved shooting in Fayette County.

Jonathan Darsaw

According to the TBI, Fayette County officials were dispatched to the 900 block of Fortune Road around 6 p.m. Wednesday after receiving reports that a man named Jonathan Darsaw had shot a woman multiple times. He refused to let her go and was threatening more violence.

At some point, the victim was released and taken to the hospital for treatment. The suspect refused to surrender and barricaded himself inside the home.

At 8:45 p.m., Darsaw stepped onto his back porch and deputies tried to take him into custody with tasers. Darsaw reportedly fired a shot at deputies, striking one of them.

The Fayette County Sheriff’s Office has identified the deputy shot as 28-year-old Jacob Jenkins. Jenkins has been with the sheriff’s office since 2012. He was treated at the hospital and later released.

At that point, the Fayette County Sheriff’s Office requested help from the Shelby County Sheriff’s Office SWAT Team.

At 4 a.m. Thursday, the SWAT Team entered the home and there was an “armed confrontation” with the Darsaw inside. He was killed.

What happened inside the home is still under investigation. The name of the woman injured was not released by the TBI.

Darsaw was charged in two robberies and the murder of one of the victims back in 2009. He reportedly admitted to being the getaway driver, but the charges were later dropped.
